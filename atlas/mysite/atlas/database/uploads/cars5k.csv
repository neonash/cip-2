car_1,Great reliable premium SUV,"Execent SUV. It's a very reliable, luxury, confortable, spacious and fun ride to drive. An excelent quality interior materials. Only its gas mileage is not so good even on Eco mode, which I use most of the times."
car_2,"2015 BMW X3 DIESEL 31,000 MILES SINCE JUNE 2015","We like the car.  However its a diesel, and with the german car manufacturer cheating, VW and Audi diesels have lost some of their luster.  However we still get over 37MPG on the highway.  Live in Maine so it's mostly highway milage.  Have had an oxygen sensor and another exhaust sensor replaced under warranty.  Not thrilled by the run-flat tires.  No jack or tools came with the car!!"
car_3,Love my Bimmer,"This is a great SUV to own, being a driving enthusiast I always dreamed to own one...BMW, even though on pricier side, this is an ultimate luxe SUV to own"
car_4,Only one problem with this car,"The X3 is my second BMW, the other being a 330 CI. Absolutely love everything about this car with one major exception - the stereo flat out sucks.  A car in this price range should come standard with a high end sound system.  My 2003 330 has the Harmon Kardon upgraded stereo which is very good but the standard system on my 2015 X3 stinks.  The stereo in my Honda Accord is actually better."
car_5,Love love love this car!!!,Love love love this car!!!
car_6,Best Ever SAV,This is by far the best SUV/SAV I have ever driven.  Quick and agile.  Nothing else compares.
car_7,Good so far,Good so far
car_8,This is my 2nd X3.  It proves once again the best car of its class.,"I owned my first X3 since 2011.Now I traded it for Diesel engine and LCI treatment.I couldn't be happier.I love the new look, and I averaged 32 MPG in first 800 miles.I am happy I chose X3 over others."
car_9,CPO is the way to go,"If you want the USB to actually be universal, you have to option the car with the expensive navigation, which I didn't, buying used, not knowing the USB wasn't. I've never used the sunroof, but love the heated steering wheel in the winter. Good little power packed mini SUV with great steering."
car_10,Still evaluating,Did not come with xm radio or zenon lights...
car_11,6 months owned still loving it,"Great car it is the ultimate driving experience, nothing compares. Handling, acceleration all fantastic. Would buy again. All still true after 6 months of owning."
car_12,Great car for a great price,"This is a fun little SAV with all the benefits of a sedan in terms of driveability (used to drive a 2006 325i), and many of the benefits of a bigger SUV as well.  Steering, handling, acceleration, and ride comfort are all outstanding, as BMW's should be, while the interior is simple yet luxurious with the premium or ultimate package.  I would highly recommend this vehicle for small families or outdoorsy singles, esp in colder climates."
car_13,Love this Car,Tires have to be replaced at 40000
car_14,Honestly still love the car - sure footed in snow,"This is a great car that still does everything well. I live in the North East where snow, ice, rain and cold weather rule here. I feel incredibly comfortable ( I am 6,2"" and it took some time, but now I am used it b) driving this X1 around New England. Mine is the Valencia Orange that is pictured, I like it because the color is very rare around where I live. I have only seen 3/4 including my own. Mine is decked out with everything, the Ultimate Package. The seats heat up fast the steering wheel warmer is an awesome feature that every car in New England should have. I love the look of the car because it is super sporty and turns heads. Just a great looking BMW. Currently wife and I are thinking whether to keep it or not, because we really enjoy the car a lot, but just bought a new truck and we really don't need three vehicles, but it's super hard to sell it because how we feel owning the car - and I think we might regret it if we did. We use this care to go to the beach, driving to work and basically just for traveling and goofing off. Now to the car itself :  The idea of run-flat tires was a good one, but not practical. The car handles like a BMW sports sedan and accelerates in all modes, I love the sport and manual mode. My wife drive it in the automatic regular driving mode. This car is very, very reliable mechanically. The New 8-speed transmission is mated fantastically well with the 2.8 turbo. Our driveway has a slight grade to it that requires our trucks sometimes to be in 4WD mode when we go up it in snow and ice. But the X1 shoots right up it very well all the time. The AWD for this vehicle is amazing, I feel super safe driving the car because the weight of the car and the handling and traction control especially when driving in the snow. The oil changes are every 14/15K miles but we usually do ours around 10K. All and all BMW made a great car here that we totally admire and love to drive.  Really the only maintenance for us has been the oil changes. I honestly feel that the quality of the engine and transmission we should be able to get 225-250K all day long. Take care of it and it will take care of you. I mentioned the car is heavy feeling and it is - if you were to get into an accident all the air bags and shear weight of the vehicle will protect you. As far as mileage goes that kinda subjective - I get between 30-34 on the hwy and 25 in the city, so Audi's cannot even come close to this. If you can find one with Navigation, you should get it, as it pretty much uses the same Nav in all the upper end Beamers."
car_15,My love BMW X1,The problem is went you trust the BMW and buy extended guaranty and you think I’m good but you realize you take you car and trust this people but  they don’t do good check in you car and they wait for the garantía finish and coming with all this repair.. so now I ask my self why I expend all this money for nothing
car_16,Adorable Car!,"I didn't expect to be able to afford this car but I'm so glad I looked!  In the price range it is so far ahead of the others we looked at.  I still haven't used the technology but I expect it to be great, as everything else is.  I was hoping to buy a car with a little more storage, but again, I'm glad I looked at this car anyway.  It really has plenty of room.  I love my X1!"
car_17,"We call her Cherry Velatte', because she IS cherry","You should get better gas mileage than the stated amount.  You will be glad it is so quiet.  We love it, and in the process of buying a new one right now."
car_18,X1 performs as review suggest,"The powertrain is what I like best about this vehicle.  Strong acceleration with minimal turgo lag, especially at highway speeds.  When you need to get power for passing or highway merging the throttle obliges.   The 8 speed transmission operates in background without feeling shifts, really nice.  I acquired the X1 wanting a vehicle for commuting to work with the versatility to handle a run to Loews or a weekend trip for two without having a big SUV since I am mostly driving by myself the majority of the time.  Looked at X3 but the trade off of the extra space versus fuel economy pushed me to the X1.  At this point, I am happy with the decision to get the 2013 CPO X1.  The lone exception to my positive experience is that the sound deadening for the 2013-2015 X1 is less than adequate.  On highways that have grooves or are choppy, the mobile microphone via bluetooth picks up enough road noise to be a nuisance for the person you call.  It's especially challenging if you are on a conference call with others (this happens for me quite a bit).  That said, I look forward to driving the X1 every time I step out the front door.  It has plenty of power, the drive is nearly car-like, and the mineral gray with coral red leather interior and Sport line looks sweet and garners compliments Some items to consider:The Sport seats are WAY more comfortable than the stock seats.  After driving X1's with Sport seats, I only looked at the Sport line.  Drove the price up $1500 or so but I reasoned the seats are part of every drive so I would make up the difference over time of ownership.The genius app very helpful in learning iDrive functions.  My experience thus far is that the voice command functions don't work as well as I would prefer.  Could be that I am not as up to speed on the voice commands as I need to be but what I've tried didn't work as desired.Storage in front of vehicle not very plentiful but I knew that going in.  Storage with seats down in back is quite plentiful.  Nav works well with the exception of voice commands as already mentioned.After a few months, still feel the same about the X1.  Only thing that has gone wrong is the Confort Touch feature for keyless entry/locking.  Dealer has not solved it yet.  Will return to dealer next week for a second try.And to reiterate, the power train in this vehicle is fantastic.One year later (May 2017)Maintainence only an oil change and routine serviceNothing has broken or been an issueLearning to live with the road noise.  I do wonder if newer model is quieter but have not driven it.Still happy with my purchase one year later."
car_19,X1,X1
car_20,A great all-around package.,"Driven my 2013 xDrive28 for 25000miles - and have no regrets. Really a surprisingly good wagon - the 8spd transmission and strong/efficient 4cyl. is impressive. Wish I had paddle shifters on mine, as I use the manual shifting option quite often and would prefer to use paddle shifters. Ergonomics are superb, electronics are for the most part all useful, iDrive system fairly intuitive, NAV system effective, though a bit frustrating to enter addresses/destinations using voice commands. Couldn't find a better package for the price two years ago when I bought it, and still can't find anything that on the whole offers fewer compromises. Yes it is small, but I'm 5'10"", and personally find the back seats quite comfortable, with plenty of headroom and legroom. If you are worried about the space back there (as I was), I would say don't rule it out, sit in it and see for yourself. My third BMW, and this one is by far the most reliable. Great car - highly recommended."
car_21,X1 perfect and fun,"A small SUV with decent ground clearance in the 2WD version, it is perfect for two people and a pet to take on forest service roads to remote fly fishing spots, will hold bikes with the front tires mounted, accelerates briskly, gets good gas mileage, handles very well, and cruises effortlessly. At 50,000 miles we have had zero problems. At 60,000 miles still no repairs required."
car_22,Great for Everyday commute in the city,I've been looking for an all wheel drive hatchback car for my daily commute.  Since I live in the midwest region I have always experienced that AWD cars are perfect.I am also into Cycling so I needed a car not to high so I can easily mount by Bicylces on the roof.  I bought my X1 Certified Used at a local BMW dealership.  I was so impressed with the performance of the car while test driving it on the roads both at High and Low speed driving.  I've driven Domestic and Japanese models before but this car has surpassed the comfort and power and now I truly understand why they call it the ultimate driving machine. The warranty also is much better than buying brand new Domestic brands since it came with a 100K Warranty being Certified used.I've been driving my X1 for 6 months now and so far everything is perfect.
car_23,Great fun to drive,"I have a 2013 X1 x28iOverall its a lot of fun to drive both acceleration and handling.It is not really a SUV so if you are expecting a lot of space in the back, you have to put the seats down (which is a bit of a hassle)It has room for 4 passengers (can do 5 in a pinch) but can't do luggage for 4 I have had good gas mileage (high 20's) and good reliabilityThere are some design features that are engineered not designed (cup holder is added on) but overall a good carUpdate - I traded my X1 in and my wife now has one (long story - I now have a 328XD and Maureen traded an older X3 for the X1)I would reaffirm my statement that the car is not really a SUV if you want to bring a lot of stuff around, but it is certainly a great car to drive.  It has been very reliable for both of us."
car_24,2013 X1,"Overall, the car is a realy joy to drive, but we've had some major mechanical issues.Less than 15,000, and we've already had it in the shop twice for cylinder replacemets, once for failure of the catalytic converter, and now for a transmission failure.All within 6 months.We'll see how the BMW dealer chooses to help rectify, but so far not happy with the build quality."
car_25,Wow! This is Fun!,"I've had my 28iXdrive for 14 months. This is my daily driver and outside 24/7.It's a small car, but good for me and my 22 mile daily commute in Chicago Winters. Mine had the heated seats and steering wheel, a must have for cold weather. The steering is so tight and precise. The acceleration of this twin turbo, blows me away, and it just keeps on going.Excellent handling car, firm suspension. I haven't had any problems at all. Mine retailed over $38k"
car_26,BMW X1,"Have had our 2013 X1 since middle of May 2013. In less than 800 miles brakes failed.Again, the same problem at 1900 miles. Seems short on power and acceleration. Not very pleased and hope to trade up very soon to an X3.Would not recommend this vehicle base on my experience."
car_27,The X1 is fantastic,"The X1 is a very solid, high performing compact SUV (or SAV as BMW calls it).The performance, corning and high quality interior are all amazing.The car has lots of power.I only have 3000 miles on the car so far but it handles very well and enjoy the many technology features on car including the numerous I drive features."
car_28,Better than expected!!!,"I got mine last September and it has been a blast ever since, 15K miles already.I've picked a Valencia Orange with M Sport Package, heated seats and Harman Kardon sound system, nothing else and the only option I miss is power seats.This thing drives exceptionally well and the hydraulic assist steering is still the best.The manner in which this vehicle goes from 60 MPH to 80, 90 or more is almost ridiculous.Serious handling and solid structure feel make it evenbetter.Of note this is my 5th BMW in the last 10 years and so I expect great things from BMW's and in this case they delivered a great little product.If you can get one and enjoy the ride, you won't be disappointed..."
car_29,Rocket ship!,"How fun! Shifting into sport mode makes this car fun. Lots of compliments. Has a surprisingly nice growl in the cabin when accelerating. Love the panoramic roof and leather interior. I got mine used....bmw owners generally maintain their cars above average so if you can find a low mileage model just out of warranty, snatch it up and you won't regret it."
car_30,Red Beauty with butter soft handling,Not enough cup holders
car_31,Great SUV!,"I have the M Package and it's worth every penny,  is gorgeous and handling is superb. Acceleration is go and no breaks down. Gass is normal for a 6 in line. I have owned for 2 1/2 year,  buy it used with 119k and now after 10k, I have to say it's still running like new,  my wife love it and it drives like a sport car,  it turns very good and breaks/stop almost as my M3. Very safe on the rain or snow due to its awd."
car_32,Great Crossover SUV IF you can afford it,"I bought my 2007 BMW X3 3.0si with about 70,000 miles in January 2012.  I was 28 years old at the time and excited about my purchase.  It was a CPO and had a 6 month warranty with it.  I drive about 30,000 miles annually and at almost 185,000 miles 4 years later I am left to ponder whether it was a good buy or not or whether I would do it again.  The car I bought had a new sticker price of something close to $44,000, so considering that the first 5 years / 70k miles absorbed about $26,000 of that made me feel good about the purchase.  It was KBB's book price for a private party sale in Good or Very Good condition.  Now that I've put 115,000 miles on it I look back at the service and maintenance history and just as I was starting to get impressed by how little went wrong in 115,000 miles but then I hit about 182k and it needed a starter, then tires, then transmission.  Needless to say it's been a bad month or so in the repair dept.  Here's a list of what I've needed to have done from 70 - 185k miles at the approximate mileage:Every 10k - new oil and filter.Every 20k - new air filter, clean MAF sensor.80k - Water pump at approx.90k - tires125k - Coolant expansion tank was cracked and replaced135k - tires150k -  windshield washer pumps150k - brake pads and rotors.155k - ignition coils and spark plugs165k - fuel filter170k - changed brake fluid, bled brakes, new anti-squeal on pads182k - tires182k - starter182k - transmission fluid & filter, differential & transfer case fluid (transmission started slipping, don't believe BMW lifetime fluids get them changed every 30-50k depending on driving conditions and climate).185k - transmission (bought used with 99k miles for $1480 - a tad under $2700 after mechanic and shop fees)"
car_33,I absolutely love my BMW!,"So being the spoiled 16 year old that I am, my parents surprised me with this car before my birthday in December of last year. I absolutely love my car. When we bought it however, the radiator was busted and it was making some kind of ticking noise. We got that fixed. We kept the car in service and I haven't wrecked or anything. The car's rear tires were worn down when we bought the car so we replaced them. We didn't know at the time that when you buy an expensive car the the front and rear tires were two different sizes. So it messed the transfer case up. When they replaced that, the towing company bent my steering rack which is now throwing off some lights and one of my O2 sensors needs to be replaced. My local BMW dealership told me that once you replace one O2 sensor that you will have to replace the others, which I found out is a lie. But I also had my oil pan replaced, (it had an oil leak when we bought it), and I wouldn't recommend taking it to a place that ""specializes"" only on foreign made cars. They charged us $2,000 to fix it. One of the parts only costed $35 and the labor was $800. Other than what all has happened, the car is an outstanding car, I honestly don't want to get rid of it. I have 4 siblings. One is a baby and the car is able to fit his car seat in it just fine! The interior is amazing to clean. Mine is white with tan interior and it is easy to spill things on it. But it is also easy to clean. I absolutely love my car and I would recommend it to anyone."
car_34,Wonderful SAV - Still in Love!,"I have had this wonderful vehicle for a few years. We bought it used with an aftermarket warranty to replace a MB C350. I am looking forward to getting in and driving it every day, even after a few years of ownership. In fact, I just realized HOW MUCH I love this car, after having to drive a truly horrible rental because my ""baby"" is in the body shop for some cosmetic repairs. The handling and power is phenomenal for a small SUV. I love the very firm suspension and the BMW sports seats are hands-down the best, most supportive seats in any vehicle I have ever driven. In fact the X3 inspired us to buy an 08 328i with very similar packages so we can seamlessly switch between a sedan an SUV.Updating this review a few years later, just to confirm what a great vehicle this is. Even at ten years old this SAV still has the power and performance to keep up with and out do many newer SUVs. Last year I drove my father-in-laws new Jeep Grand Cherokee for a day or two and found it a sluggish, lumbering beast compared to my X3. I keep on top of maintenance and use a BMW specialized independent shop. As a result, I do not feel that cost of ownership is any higher than for other (""lesser"") vehicles of this age. The naturally aspirated inline six engine is one of the most durable engines BMW has ever built!"
car_35,DO NOT BUY BMW X3 READ THIS!,"We own a 2007 x3 and has been to the shop 7 times on top of the schedule maintenances.We were stranded on a major Hwy IH35- and had SUV towed twice for engine overheating, waterpump replaced, thermostat on another trip, brake pads at 33k miles, engine leaking at 55k miles (paid $600 to replace engine gaskets) , Engine coils replaced, computer reprogrammed for idle problems,door and roof seals letting air in (got very noisy) Buy one and you'll see what I'm talking about.The dealer and BMW will tell you this is NORMAL FOR A BMW!! or just go by their shop before you buy and it will be full of cars being serviced, I guarantee it!!"
car_36,Great Car...So Fun To Drive!,"Purchased my Platinum Bronze Metallic X3 certified pre-owned in 2010. I've owned many cars, and exclusively SUV's (2 Grand Cherokees and a Toyota Highlander) since the early 90's and this is by far the best handling, best performing car I've ever owned. It accelerates like a dream. If you're buying one CPO, purchase the extended maintenance warranty. I've had several repairs after the ""service soon"" light came on, and they were all covered under the warranty. All around a great car, loaded with luxury features, and and exhilarating driving experience!"
car_37,"I love it but, it doesn't love me?!","We bought my X3 two years ago, at a great price and with 38,000 miles on it. It is my first suv and not my last. I love this car... it's fast, great looking and a great size (i'm 5'3) Only problem, it has been in the shop more then 8 times... thank goodness we got the extended warranty! New water pump, muffler, engine pistons and other misc items! If I didn't have the warranty and a loaner from my dealership I don't know what I would do. After almost 2 and a half years later, I am looking into a new suv (and not another bmw)"
car_38,BMW engineers are not very clever,"I have a 2007 X3. Keeps getting Service Engine light every 2000 miles. I bought it as certified pre owned in 2007 May. So far I have been to service for about 15 times (This is real number, not exaggeration). Dealer keeps saying they don't know what's wrong, they just do whatever BMW engineers tells them to do and looks like BMW engineers haven't been able to figure out what's wrog so far. Every time they find a new excuse on what's wrong. If they can't even find the reason behind such a small issue, one wonders about the accuracy of their claims towards their ""intelligent"" safety features - its probably just a claim."
car_39,certifed used X3 in 2009,"I bought my X3 of a 3 year lease - dealer gave a certifed warranty until 50k miles. Mine has a the 6 speed manual trans w/3 litre engine many options (moonroof and MP3,etc)It drives great, but the orig sticker was about 45,000 and I paid much less.Maintenance on this car is exppensive - to replace one tire was $280 and BMW recommends only oil changes after 15,000 miles - much too long. It's a fun car to drive, habdles great and has some storage, but I do need lots of seats."
car_40,BMW X3 is a driving experience,Purchased X3 CPO. Looks brand new. It has lots of pep but I wouldn't mind about 20 more HP. The ride is smooth. I have to laugh at anyone that says this is a rough ride...they have obviously never driven a jeep or a truck. The seats (front and back) are comfy. Acceleration is smooth. Sound system is amazing. The front and rear collision detection is handy. The nav is pretty good. In fact the vehicle is almost flawless. The ONLY flaw that I dont like is about this suv is that the leg room for drivers right leg is reduced by a hump in the interior wall by the gas peddle.And it could use more storage. I have no where to put my sunglasses.
car_41,Do not buy a BMW x3,"We have taken the x3 to the shop about 7 times for engine overheating problems / computer problems/ do not buy BMW x3 will bring you problems. Contacted BMW headquarters and they do not help. They don't care about the customer and if you run out of warranty you will have to pay $3,000 for an extended warranty or trade in the SUV. Not reliable/ my kids don't want to take trips/ left us stranded on I-35. BMW does not care!"
car_42,Not a huge fan,"My first BMW; so excited to get it and compared it to all mini-SUV models.  Have had it six months and trading it; hubby and I loved to drive it; hate to ride in it.  6 year old gets car sick the ride is so rough.  I loved the idea of a BMW, but have found perhaps I am not such a fan of German engineering after all.  I wish it would have worked out.  Plenty of power, we simply cannot handle the rough ride."
car_43,No COMPASS when hot,"In temps of 100, when you get in car, compass will not work. After car cools down, about 20 min, compass works fine. Taken for repair twice, & they say not showing up on computer, so they can't find problem, but I can, when temp is around 100. Our warranty runs out next month with 17,000 miles."
car_44,This car is a 4 wheel nightmare,"Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this absolute wreck of an automobile. The automatic transmission is a mess. My car has 60,000 mikes and has had the transfer case replaced, the rear and front differential, exhaust system and more. It spends at least a week in the shop every 3-4 months. BMW of NA is completely non- responsive as is the dealer. Without exception the worse car I have ever owned. This is my rid and last BMW. Do yourself a favor and get and Audi."
car_45,Love my x3,Purchased used w/ BMW's Certified warranty wasn't even looking at this model but it came up in the dollar amount I was searching for. I'm really glad I purchased this vehicle for the price it a lot of car. I have not had any problems with transmission it works just fine. I believe it not the trans. but the drivers it's electronic and you can confuse it by your driving style. It's also adaptive which means it learns your driving style and if more then one person drives vehicle and they have different driving styles then you might think your having problems. This vehicle pulls good on the highway but could use another 40 HP.
car_46,Solid purchase,Bought a CPO with premium and sport package in May. Have driven approximately 5200 miles since without real complaint. The Nevada leather seats are great and I love the huge moonroof. I commute ~50 miles/day mostly highway and enjoy every bit of my drive. Handles like a dream. Gas mileage has been fair averaging ~22.5 mpg (65/35 highway). Did have to take in for a solenoid issue but service experience was excellent. Haven't had any transmission issues reported in other posts.
car_47,Big Mistake,"The X3 with premium and sport package looks good in a parking lot or a garage. Ride is hard. Back seat is hard. Nothing happens smoothly or refined. Choppy ride, confused transmission, not enough cup holders or console storage. It's just not worth $44k. It's in the shop, again, for warranty repairs. They tried to tell me it was ready to pick up a few days ago. Hadn't fixed either of the 2 main things it was there for. (Crazy wipers and rattling tailpipe) Still in the shop with no updates. The loaner is wonderful, 2011 328i sedan. It does everything better than the X3. It's like they learned how to build a vehicle, but don't want to do anything with a warranty repair of their past mistakes."
car_48,"Fun, Exciting But Has Some Bugs","Purchase experience was very pleasant.  BMW service is very good.  My 2007 X3 was Certified Pre- Owned and had only 24K miles.  I purchased the Extended Full Warranty which was nearly the cost of a full brake job ($1800) at 60k so I considered it money well spent.  I have had 2 significant issues with the X3 so far.  First, one of the two engine coolant pumps malfunctioned and the vehicle wont let you drive over 20mph for fear of overheating and damage.  It happened at 29K miles.  Had to use BMW assist to get towed to dealer (took two hours for tow to arrive).  Second, had major transmission fluid leak due to bad gasket at 30k miles.  Fun car but has been in the shop too many times."
car_49,Fun and practical,"I purchased this X3 with manual transmission as new in 2007, and have enjoyed driving it ever since. I love its steering and ride, better than the 2010 GLK 4matic that wife owns. And to my taste it strikes a good balance between power and fuel efficiency. Nimble yet offers plenty of space for a small family and large cargo room with second row folded down. The leatherette interior is care free. No problems so far except for a burned out brake light. 4x4 warning light came up once, and went away by itself. Dealer cannot tell what's going on..."
car_50,fun and power,"I leased this 2007 X3 for 3 years without a single mechanical or electronic issue. At around 25,000 miles I had to replace the 4 tires because they were worn out. otherwise no issues. we loved it so much that we bought an 09 X3 at the end of the lease. It's been 6 months since the 09 X3 and no issues at all."
car_51,It's Great Driving a BMW,"Purchased this CPO 2007 model to move my wife out of mini vans.  She instantly appreciated the sensation of driving a BMW.  Acceleration is smooth and powerful and handling is exceptional.  The cabin fits her well and gives her a great view of the road.  The automatic transmission does take some getting used to; it shifts a little differently than most. We've had some some issues (for example, had to get the cylinder head replaced) but all were covered under warranty and included a 3 Series loaner car.  Going the CPO route saves a lot of money while still getting great warranty.  This is an excellent vehicle and a blast to drive."
car_52,Much better ride over 330i,"Seventh BMW I have owned. I tried to take trips in my former BMW330i, however always felt like I was beat up. Now the good stuff, the X3 has just returned from our first 1,200 mile trip, comfort, power over mountains, 10% ethanol fuel in 3 states didn't produce a change in power but did drop fuel economy by one or so miles per gallon, average at 80mph and up to 90mph at times it creeps up there with ease, just under 21 mpg.  I think this is a long term relationship, easier to get into and out of, the giant moon roof, Xdrive must be felt to appreciate the grip that is there.  Screaming RED color tipped to this vehicle over another. Certified and 6yr~100,000m service and oil changes."
car_53,Best Buy EVER,"What you've heard is true. Once you drive a BMW, you will be hooked for life. I love driving the X3, so does my husband. His Acura MDX now gets very little action. He prefers the X3. Lots of power. Handles beautifully on Seattle's wet roads and in heavy traffic. Nice size to parallel park downtown."
car_54,Sports Car not SUV,"I just bought the X3 with Sports Package with 34K miles as a certified used car. The car is under warranty and still smells and looks like new but I paid 15K less than buying a new X3.  The X3 drives and handles like a sports car.  The 260HP engine is perfect. I drove Lexus RX, Acura RDX, Mercedes GLK and they do not come close to the X3 handling."
car_55,A Sports Car In SUV Clothing,"Got mine three years ago - Sports pkg, premium pkg, winter pkg. Sapphire black metallic with black interior, 18"" all- weather tires (didn't want to have to swap summer tires every winter). Handles like a sports sedan, cargo area more than a wagon, great road visibility, excellent build quality. The sports pkg can be a rough ride, but I like it. Probably not the best family vehicle, because it feels more like a sports car. No mechanical issues, but I notice BMW has a software update regarding its AT problem that some people have experienced - I prefer driving in manual mode, to me it's the best of both worlds. Tons of fun with superb handling!"
car_56,Sport Activity Vehicle defined,"Now with the odometer rolling past the 50,000 mark, my compliments to the chef. I hate numb steering, overweight and too-big SUV's. This SUV really is a 3-series with a lot of road clearance and a big boost to the rear storage space.  It does suffer from a higher center of gravity over the lower riding 3-series but that can be offset with a Sport Pkg option that helps to reduce the suspension give and body roll. Also, the sport seats are the best with what may be the best in the industry.  In a nutshell, the X3 is clearly the most fun to drive in this segment.  It is almost 1,000lbs less in weight than its X5 brethren and only 4 cu ft less in cargo--the 3.0 is the perfect small SUV."
car_57,Good car!,"It's really a good car and all of a driving experience. I work home-office so do not use the car a lot - only 7,500 miles per year average, however, it is quite enjoyable to drive it every time I go the airport and go to pick up the kids at school."
car_58,Solid Fun to Drive Small SUV,"Fun to drive, great handling (for a SUV) with the 19"" and sport package, a little rough riding at times though. Comfortable and decent fuel economy (premium fuel uhh). No issues to date, Nice sound system, nav is just ok, but the bluetooth rocks. An overlooked small SUV that competes very well all around, careful price jumps with options! Good Value if you buy 1 year old."
car_59,Superb car,I purchased this with the sports package and absolutely love it! The x3 has superb performance and handling.
car_60,One great car....,"The BMW X3 is a perfect car for a person who likes performance, styling and great handling.  Mine has the sports package and M styling and looks terrific.  I had driven BMW 5 Series cars for 20 years, but needed occasional storage capacity to carry a drum set.  I also have an X5 which is beautiful but it doesn't come anywhere near the X3 for performance and handling.  The fit and finish is top notch with great features like the full length sunroof.  I also enjoy the sitting position which is higher than a sedan but not so high that you sway with every bump like you do in most trucks and SUVs. One great car...."
car_61,Awesome Ride!!,This car has gone above and beyond what I expected. Was also looking at the Lexus and Mercedes and their drive compared to the BMW was night and day. If you're looking for a fun car that is the best performing car in its class the BMW X3 is the only logical choice.
car_62,Should have got the X3 in the 1st place,"I bought a 2008 CR-V and simply was not happy with it.  It is wonderfully versatile but it had no power, was noisy, had a rough ride at times and the seats were very uncomfortable.  After 3 months I traded the Honda for a CPO X3 and I couldn't be happier.  With the X3 I really have to watch my speed.  The engine is silky smooth, its quiet, and feels solid as a rock.  It may not be as roomy as the CR-V but I can definitely trade that for the joy of driving.  If you are considering a small SUV think if you are buying it for yourself or for others.  If you care about passenger comfort and versatility then the CR-V is a great choice.  But if you want to have a smile on your face get an X3."
car_63,Very nice ride,"Just purchased my 2007 X3 with 24100 miles on it a little over a week ago.  This is the best handling SUV I have driven.  Lots of power from the 3.0L straight 6.  Very comfortable seats.  Stereo sound quality is excellent.  Much better than my '04 330ci convertible.  I tried the sport package on another X3 and the ride was too rough for my taste.  The aesthetic updates for '07 look great.  Bluetooth is not always clear, but works okay.  Also, the throttle tip-in is a little touchy and takes some getting used to at low speed.  I was looking for a small SUV that was fun to drive, this fits the bill nicely.  The Japanese companies can't compete with German build quality, ride and handling"
car_64,A Bit Disappointed,"I guess I expected more from my first BMW.   My wife hated the way it drove around town, so now it's mine.  The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall.  On the highway it rides like a dream.  It's like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph.  I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service, they had to replace the cylinder head.  That was another nightmare.  The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience."
car_65,Happy So Far,"Second BMW (first being M3).  Purchased pre-owned.  Love almost everything about it.  Has just about every possible option and package.  Love the 19"" wheels.  Did have to adjust driving some to accommodate for brake assist and trans system.  Once I have done that, it is fine and very enjoyable to drive.  Do not have problems others have mentioned.  Just took a judicious right foot.  Very comfy sport seats and great thick M-sport steering wheel.  Now that we have a baby, it is perfect.  Not my M3, but a good compromise for the time being."
car_66,Review Update > Happy Owner,"I have been a BMW and Saab owner for the past 20 years, I have to say that after driving the X3 for the past year and a bit I am still very happy that I have it!  I enjoy driving and I travel a lot, I go where it snows and where it's hot year round, I have found that this SAV performs well in most situations and is fun to drive.  I have had very few problems and they were all minor ones.  The auto transmission that I have operates differently in sport mode providing the burst of torque when you need it but I did not have issues with the transmission as noted by other reviewers.  I have also noted that as more miles were driven the fuel economy has gone up close to the stated 26 MPG HWY."
car_67,"Bugs gone, now its a blast!","Bought this vehicle used as I could not afford new.  Unfortunately previous owner never serviced vehicle.  Had to take into local BMW dealer 4x before we got the throttle response issue cleared.  Car hesitated and bucked, was scared to be in traffic when I needed quick acceleration.  But the warranty is awesome, treated like a queen at dealership given loaner each time, who still does that?  No other automaker I know of.  Computer need to be defragged and re-booted so we could start fresh.  It worked, my little baby is performing fantastic and I love driving it, it truly is a driving experience like the ads say!"
car_68,Disappointed,"This is my second x3, the 1st a 2004 so I expected a better BMW but what I got was what others are complaining about: poor shifting patterns at speeds under 40 mph. Has been in the shop for software fixes but no improvements and the techs tell me they don't notice the problem. The sport drive is horrible and this is called a ""sport utility vehicle"". This is not what I expected from BMW."
car_69,Transmission Nightmare - Recall needed,"Driving along a back country road and slump. The transmission felt like it dropped out the bottom. It left me stranded since when I turned it back on it refused to recognize reverse, drive, any gear whatsoever. Since then I have had a ""software update"" and it is still extremely sluggish in first gear and before I know it I am in third at a snail pace. Highway driving is excellent but in traffic a nightmare, and unreliable shifting. I was told this is a worldwide problem by my dealer regarding X3 transmissions and although this is happening to several X3's it is not large enough to recall. There needs to be a recall. Lurching and shifting so hard that it bucks is not acceptable for a BMW."
car_70,young man... love it,"Although this is typically a car for women, I'm a 30 year old man, and I love this car.  I needed to purchase an SUV and love how the X3 drives like a sedan, but is great in the snow and on wet surfaces.  I enjoy the tight steering and quickness.  It's much more agile than any SUV I've ever driven."
car_71,Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde,"This is our 3rd X3, and I loved the other two, both 2005s. This seems to be a different vehicle.  Same great finish and handling, but awful acceleration. As written elsewhere, it is bothersome and dangerous.  I loved the responsive, fun to drive qualities of our other X3s.  This one makes me scared to enter the highway. Not so fun.  Once you get past 40, it is fine, but getting there can be tough.  Sometimes you punch it and boom, other times you count to three before anything happens.  Someone is going to get into an accident because of this.  We went to the dealer and they tried a software fix, but it only made it marginally better and we seem to have lost 1-2 MPG. Disappointing."
car_72,6 speed manual = happy,"There is a lot of complaining about the automatic transmission version of this machine. I bought an x3 manual with 6000 miles on it in February 2008 and have put 8000 miles on it since then.  This is a great vehicle if you like driving. Fantastic low-end torque. Great acceleration in 2nd, 3rd and 4th.  5th and 6 are highway overdrives.  Corners flat in aggressive driving.  Have never had better brakes.  Pulls a utility trailer loaded with stuff for the dump like its not there.  I was skeptical about BMW reliability. No issues so far and the 100,000 mile warranty should have me covered.  It doesn't have all the cup holders and storage that a Japanese vehicle has... drives much better though."
car_73,Goodbye !,"I finally had enough. Took a major loss by trading in the 2007 X3. Bought the car for 43K and got 29K in trade in ! The transmission problem in my opinion is dangerous and makes the car unpredictable in many situations (turns, acceleration from stop). Although I brought it back to the dealer for the fix, the problem persisted. In my opinion, it is a disgrace that BMW has the audacity to label this thing the ""ultimate driving machine"". I have been permanently soured by the BMW brand. Goodbye !"
car_74,Makes Driving Fun,"I drive a lot. Over 120 miles a day.  Its sleek, powerful using the steptronics, and comfortable. I have been a BMW owner for a few years now and traded in my 06 330i for the x3. So far no complaints."
car_75,Class Ride,"Bought this car for my wife who was reluctant to own since she doesn't like the tight, sports car like ride.  She prefers the soft, floating on air feel.  Well, it's mine now.  The X3 has a lot of get up and go, and you just have to breathe on the brakes to stop the vehicle.  On the highway, you need self-control to keep it under 100 mph.  It's like riding on a rail.  However, around town in stop and go traffic, it is not smooth acceleration and shifting.  It lurches off the line and then quickly starts upshifting.  It's what my wife did not like about it, and I have to agree.  All things considered, it is an awesome vehicle and has a real class aura about it.  I highly recommend it."
car_76,Makes me nauseated,"Transmission shifting issues - shifts so jerky it will actually make me car sick.  Have had back to dealer 2x for updates, shifting improved, but not even close to acceptable for any vehicle, but this one is $40k+.  Dealer told me fix is to shift manually - no thanks, I didn't buy a stick shift.  Live in western PA, lots of hills, car will not shift out of 2nd gear starting up a hill unless speed exceeds 25 mph - that's about 3500 rpm. When you take your foot off the gas, it throws you like hitting the brakes!  Terrible engineering from a premier automotive company."
car_77,Great Performing AWD,"Bought this as an American Spec X3 in Germany with the Manual 6-speed and most options; a superb driving machine.  For an AWD and SUV like vehicle, it does very well on gas mileage - getting 25 hwy and 20 city, and that is at 90 mph on German Autobahns.  The vehicle handles very well and the steering is outstanding.  I think the 6-speed manual is key to driving pleasure and better mileage (contrary to specs) - but could not imagine using in city traffic and most state side driving stop and go conditions."
car_78,Anxiety,"I bought my x3 in 12/06. My first Bimmer! The third time I drove it, it quit on me. It was in the shop 9 days to re-program a computer problem. The hesitation problem others list is a perfect description of my x3. Sometimes, the hesitation has absolutely scared me. I have had a sidelight casing replaced due to moisture, have an obvious rattle from the sunroof cover and have had the lifters clacking since I bought the car. Today, I am headed to the dealer to attempt to negotiate my way out of this car into another. The only reason I'm going back to BMW is because of the known problems and my chances of recouping some of the losses on it. Do not recommend this car to anyone."
car_79,Bad Transmission,"I bought this vehicle to be both fun and utility vehicle. The transmission behaves so erratically it is downright dangerous. On more than several occasions its lack of response has cause near fatal accidents. It typically hesitates between 2-3 gear which is where you are at when entering a turn-about or merging into traffic quickly. The sports drive mode down shifts so hard that you swear you have been ""rear-ended"" by another driver. BMWNA has tried to pass this off as part of the ""adaptive"" or learning features of this car."
car_80,X3 weaknesses,"There is definite hesitation when attempting quick acceleration.  The gps is horrendous!  Neither my husband nor myself have figured out how to enter addresses.  It just shouldn't be this difficult.  His aftermarket gps works like a dream.  Not only is it easy to imput data, but also warns of traffic slow downs and alternative routes.  The stereo is mediocre.  The controls are mediocre."
car_81,Disappointing Transmission,"Original impression of X3 3.0si on test drive was quite positive. I purchased a certified X3 3.0si with 12K miles. Car handles well and has powerful engine. Transmission is erratic at best. Sometimes does not engage at all, others shifts very hard and can cause nausea in passengers. BMW service can't find issue which suggests that they have not figured out optimal transmission match to the 3.0si engine in the X3."
car_82,Great small SUV package,"Picked it up in Munich on the European delivery plan. Fantastic to drive in the Austrian and Slovenian Alps.  Now driving it for normal U.S. city driving and it continues to be a pleasure. A very few, very minor issues: oddly placed cupholder on passenger side, for example. But have experienced none of the transmission problems others complain of, and the overall quality is high. This replaced an Acura TL. I liked the TL a lot, but like the X3 better."
car_83,"Sports Car Performance, SUV Size","I bought this when it was between the Acura RDX and Lexus RX. The Bimmer won out with every feature available and I am loving it. Its reliability has been spot on and it has a better warranty than Toyota, Honda and GM! If bought, be sure to get a tire warranty. I got a nail in mine and got it repaired for $400! It shows how good the BMW's quality is. Best buy for sure!"
car_84,All I Expected and More,"This is, without question, the best automobile I've ever owned.  It is powerful, responsive, agile for its size/weight and BMW's N52 straight-6 engine is buttery smooth and quiet. (Although one doesn't hear it inside the vehicle, from outside the vehicle the X3's exhaust note has a nice bit of a growl.)  I opted for the 6-speed manual transmission, and I must say it takes a bit of getting used to.  The clutch pedal has a lot of ""travel"" in it, but the engagement point is a fairly narrow area quite near to where the clutch pedal is in its undepressed state.  I'm impressed with the fit and finish of the vehicle and it just has a nice, solid feel to it."
car_85,It's a nice SAV,"I have owned this SAV for almost a week now.  This is my first small SUV, I am a car guy but I travel where there is snow a few times every year and I wanted to be able to take something on my trips that would drive like a car but be able to take the weather with no worries.  I think I found my vehicle,  The handling on the X3 is great and I don't find the suspension too stiff, I did not order the sport package.  My X3 was ordered with the luxury package, the 18"" wheels; front seat warmers; servo-tronic steering; upgraded radio and xenon headlights.  So far I am very satisfied with this X3, I look forward to every drive, every day.  My advice is to go and test drive one."
car_86,lacking,"Have driven my X1 over 2000 miles and still the fuel efficiency is only 27.3 max. I drive only highways, use the cruise control, and the eco option.The steering wheel feels heavy (in comparison with my old SAAB that is a delight to drive) but I will take a bunch of weight lifting classes with a personal trainer starting next week so this should help to drive (no kidding - it is a heavy cow, like it has no power assist, maybe it does not).The car does not allow for a trailer mount to put a bike rack on the back, the roof rack is hard to find (yes, Thule apparently makes it but I ordered one at REI over a month ago and I am still waiting). It looks nice in orange, though..."
car_87,Gas mileage is not as promised other than that it's great SUV,"BMW promises gas mileage of 24-34, I normally drive to work and very little city(20%), was expecting at least 30mpg. but not even close, I normally get around 26-28mpg, I used to drive Prius, so knows how to save on gas while driving on freeway or in city. Other than that the really loved this SUV."
car_88,Beware of the tires!,"The car has 3000 miles on it, is great to drive, good on ice and snow. Unfortunately, we have to drive it on a short gravel road....a road which is graded regularly and well maintained. A small piece of gravel embedded in the tire and caused a slow leak. When the stone was removed....totally flat tire which I was told did not allow the car to be driven (my home is 40 miles from the nearest dealer). No replacement tire available for 3 days. No loaner cars available. Almost $600 for a new tire....$130 for car rental.Perhaps this is an isolated event and there will be no additional tire problems. If not, there will be one very unhappy customer!"
car_89,2013 BMW X1 XDrive 28i,"I special order this vehicle in Aug 2012 and got it from the dealership in Sep 24 2012.Vehicle is loaded with all options,color -mineral gray metallic.Its a wow! luxury Sav.Its extremely fun to drive-long or short distances,my wife loves to drive it all time,its solid and comfortable to drive,it delivers excellent performance,power,handling and gas mileage.The exterior design is unique,interior is of high quality,high tech gadgets and accessories are simple to use,safety features are impressive.Its fast and quick acceleration,The2013 bmw x1 is worth buying."
car_90,Does what it says,"Over the last six months, I looked at and drove every available vehicle in its class, and the X1 is about asgood as it gets. It is solid, reliable, relatively economical, handles well, is quiet, and has enough room for a small family. It looks good and the build quality is impressive. Visibility is good for its class and it is loaded with enough technology to keep most people happy.With the ""save the planet"" switch ( aka eco-pro ) turned off it accelerates to 60 mph in less than 6.5 seconds, and with it on, the fun factor drops but the mileage goes up. You get to pick!"
car_91,Great Vehicle,"My wife and I wanted a new vehicle that would be good on gas, fun to drive, 4 wheel drive, and have room for kids. This car meets all of the above. It has been great on gas for an SUV/SAV. When you drive the car you feel safe and solid. It is a pleasure to drive. The all-wheel drive system is awesome. We drove in the snow/ice and noticed no slippage of the wheels. Driving the same roads a few minutes later with my front wheel drive car I noticed a good amount of tire slippage. This car is built very well. The engine has plenty of power even though it is a 4 cylinder! The warranty is also another selling point for us. This vehicle is worth every penny!"
car_92,Fun to drive and fuel saving!,Pros:
car_93,Unique Value,"I've been driving my X1 for about a month now, and can say it's the perfect combo of fun and functionality for me.The 2 liter turbo is wonderfully paired with the 8 speed auto. I've driven stick shifts for the past 20 years, and haven't missed the control of a manual -this auto reads my mind.I was looking for an AWD wagon that was fun to drive, compact, but not cramped.It came down to this and the Subaru Outback, but the Outback was a little too big and soft for me.I said ""no"" to all the pricey packages, getting ala carte options like heated seats, panoramic moonroof (worth every penny), and some nice wood inlays.The car was about $33k - a real value for such a well built vehicle"
car_94,"Practical, Powerful, and fun too!","We just took delivery of our Valencia Orange X135 M Sport with all the options.What a car!!After driving a few of the competitors, the choice was clear once we drove the X1.There is nothing like a BMW, and this one is solid.The layout of the interior is very nice, seats are comfortable, visibility is good, and the Harmon-Kardon sound system is awesome.You will never think of this car as an SUV when it comes to driving dynamics.Despite the slightly higher ride height, you may as well be driving a BMW sedan with the older, better, hydraulic steering setup.Also, this car is an amazing value, coming in nearly fully loaded under 50 grand."
car_95,A high performance station wagon,"The X1 is a really good idea. For whatever reason Americans won't buy station wagons, even though they have tons of good qualities. Instead they buy pigmobile SUVs. The X1 is actually a 3 series station wagon, but designed to fool people into thinking it's an SUV. The 2 liter turbo four is plenty powerful with the 8 speed, and gets amazing gas mileage for the performance you get.Unlike most SUVs this car has amazing handling.About the only downside is that it is not large inside, for us it's fine, but this isn't going to work as a hauler.Compare to something like a Subaru or 32k, the 38k for this is a bargain!"
car_96,Transmission Problems,"Reporting back after 4500 miles driven. This X3 has a faulty transmission. It causes hesistation on acceleration from a stop, in curves, on hills, and in turns. The transmission needs to be reprogrammed (reference SB 24-08-07). Even after reprogramming the transmission is erratic. Would be very careful before purchasing."
car_97,Warranty King,"I had this car for a 1 1/2yrs and I love it. This is my first BMW and I will continue to buy due to the best warranty service. I've taking my car in for an oil change for zero cost. The car handles very well in the rainy season, the seats are comfortable. The sunroof is awesome though a little loud and the trunk is very spacious. I've driving this car from and to California and it just runs smoothly. The performance of a BMW is no comparison."
car_98,Never thought I would drive an SUV,"I used to be very much against SUVs.  I had a purchase and sales agreement all drawn up for a BMW 3 wagon, and then at the last minute I asked the sales person to let me drive a 2007 BMW X3 in a 6 speed manual.  WOW, I was 100% sold.  Coming out of a Volvo V70 T5 wagon, I needed the practicality of a wagon to haul items for my business.  The 3 wagon did this job but was a bit tight.  The X3 had more room without sacrificing anything in performance.  So far the experience with the vehicle and BMW have been nothing less than superb.  Sure, it is not a cheap drive, but the fit, finish is unbelievable.  I am getting 23-24 around town and 27 mpg on the highway.  I HIGHLY recommend the 6 speed."
car_99,Great SAV,"I have owned the car now for about a week, and it performs very well. I don't find any hesitation as some reviews have stated. What some call hesitation is the engine coming up on the torque curve, not a transmission problem.  I would like to physically be able to check the oil instead of depending on the computer to tell me that it is O.K. This is a great automobile, as every BMW I have owned was."
car_100,Worst New Car I Ever Owned,"I bought my new X3 a week ago and it is a total nightmare.  I did not know that there was a major engine hesitation with many of these vehicles, and mine is very bad and even dangerous.  The steering is not aligned due to either a wheel alignment issue or the wheel itself is not centered.  The controls including the navigation system are way too complex and awkward, and using knobs to control everything is absurd. My car has cosmetic defects on the fabric on doors and pillars, and it looks like they totally left out the quality in this SUV.  Overall, should have got the RDX."
car_101,Classy ride,"My husband and I love our new X3.  We were  originally going to go with the Volvo XC90, but after test driving the X3, we loved it.  It handles better than the XC90 and it's cheaper."
car_102,I'm A Cool Mom Now!,"I downgraded from a mom mobile (minivan), and I love this little car.  It fits me and my two little ones nicely.  It's quick and fun to drive.  The gas mileage is better than my van, and the tank is smaller so fill ups are less too (even using premium gas).  I love the bluetooth capability.  I feel so much cooler in this than my van!"
car_103,Thumbs up for the '07 X3,"I purchased an '07 X3 for my wife six months ago and we couldn't be happier. City parallel parking made short body length important factor. Ultimately we chose between the Acura RDX and the X3. This '07 X3 had a far superior engine compared to the '05 and '06 versions that we test drove. In fact, the older engines disappointed quite a bit. This vehicle handles like a 330. The AWD was flawless over the New England winter. Mileage is good for an SUV. The ride is just a touch stiff, but much softer than my M3 on city roads, and overall its a joy to drive. Storage is far better than a sedan. Reliability has been perfect."
car_104,Best SUV ever,"I was hesitant while buying this car after testing both Acura SUVs, Lexus RX, Mercedes ML, Missan Murano, Infiniti FX, Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and it performed the best. The only thing I disliked about the car is the limited availability. I live in Maryand and the closest I could find was in Virginia, 400 miles away from my dealer. I got the sport package and love it. The seats are more supportive than anything. One thing I would recommend on the car is getting a warranty on your tires. I got a nail in my tire after 1200 miles. It was a $450 tire. Luckily I got it insured. One thing that BMW never has gotten right on any car they have made is cupholders."
car_105,Fun to Drive,We purchased the X3 early this year. So far I have no regrets. Reasonable gas mileage. Confortable heated seats and fun to drive.
car_106,Good Enough,We had a 325xi wagon for the past three years and really enjoyed it. We were not sure that we were going to get another BMW because we wanted to save some money on the payments. So we went and drove a ton of cars and decided that we liked what BMW had to offer in either a new 325 wagon or an X3. The X3 had the best pricing incentives for a lease so we went with it. The car is a base model with auto trans. It handles like a BMW. We like the leatherette for clean up and comfort. The radio could be better for the price. The DTC is miserable. We turn it off all the time. It makes the car hunt around in 1st and 2nd gear trying to avoid losing traction.
car_107,Thanks to BMW for manufacturing X3,"X3 is a very beautiful car in my opinion, which has a very good stable design and controls that make it very safe and help on running fearless while driving this car. 200 KM/hr is not a dangerous speed at all in this car, due to its high safety controls. Also it has a good cd player with a fantastic sound system."
car_108,Sweet Ride,"The interior is well appointed and everything is within easy reach.  I'm a little disappointed on the sound system, I was told by my BMW rep that iPod connectivity was standard.  It does have a port, but you pay extra for the integrated cable for control on the sound system, the speakers really aren't all that, my jeep grand cherokee was better in that aspect.  I have only had it 4 days, but I just love it otherwise.  I look for excuses to go for a drive, the gas mileage seems to be ok except when you get on the gas hard, tranny seems rough."
car_109,Get a Bimmer!,"I've test driven from a toyota RAV to a Benz and all those cars don't come close to the feel, styling and performance of this car. Probably those other car companies will take pieces of the body style but there's only one BMW."
car_110,European Delivery,"BMW's European delivery program is one of the best. Our car was waiting in Munich with a tank full of gas and ready for our trip across Germany, Switzerland and France.  Our X3 performed flawlessly over international roadways and narrow back streets.  We enjoyed traveling 1500  miles before leaving the vehicle in Nice, FR for shipment to the USA."
car_111,Hesitation-awful transmission,"I just bought a 2007 BMW X3. I test drove a different one, then took the one off the showroom floor in the color I wanted. I did not notice hesitation on test drive, but immediately noticed on mine. It is a week old and I hate it. Not to mention the stupid plastic  handle that my knee constantly hits. The hesitation is horrible. It does it from a dead stop, and while driving at slow speeds. It is unacceptable to me-I want to return it. The transmission is so erratic, that passengers complain about the rough and jolty ride-it is embarrasing to tell them I spent so much on a piece of junk. I think I made a mistake. This is going to be my last BMW. I should have bought the Nissan Murano!"
car_112,Don't be a sucker for BMW,"Okay, I have myself to blame.  I buy a new car every two years, last one was a 2004 Acura TL--not the most expensive car I've owned, but far and away the best car in every category.  I read the reviews for BMW X3 and know the car was not higly thought of in the past--but that 2007 was a NEW year with many improvements.  The gas mileage is bad! 18mpg city/highway. The tranny is rough, and at low RPM there is almost zero torque and a rough go until about 25mph.  The electronics are less than high tech--the radio is pathetic for a $44k vehicle--and the rear seats, despite what the catalogue said, do not fold flat, making the rear space useless for boxes, dogs, and anything else."
car_113,Great Small SUV,"I just bought the X3 after months of research.  I've been very happy with it. Great engine, nice interior, good interior storage space for vehicle size."
car_114,Wow!,"I drug my husband to test drive the Lexus Hybrid SUV, he drug me to test drive the X3.  On paper I really thought we would like the Lexus better, but the X3 won hands down.  Easier to turn into a parking space, felt roomier in the front, so much fun to drive. I'm only 5'4"" but felt I could see out of the X3 better and with more personal space. Now my husband and I are at odds over who gets to drive the SUV (it's MINE).  Who would have thought?"
car_115,Sports Car Disguised As SAV!,"Just completed my first commute in my new '07 X3 - it turned the twisty mountain roads into a flat, straight freeway! The V6 is very quick & smooth, handling is fantastic and up/down shifts by the 6 speed auto trans were imperceptible. The brakes are almost too good, as I am learning to be very gentle with the brake pedal to avoid stopping too fast. Looked at CX-7, RDX, RAV4, CR-V & Edge - the X3 was far and away the most fun to drive while getting better mpg than CX-7, RDX & Edge and only 2 highway mpg less than Rav4 & CR-V AWD. Storage room with back seats up or down was equal or larger than these other CUV options."
car_116,Overall a good  vehicle but pricey,Great vehicle dynamics; silky smooth transmission; good trunk space; switched from FX 35 which was a great car. Has less interior storage compartments than FX 35. Nowhere near the interior quality of the FX. My X3 has a sticker price of 44k and can you belive in that price is not even a car alarm included. But what is bothering me is those very cheap controls on the radio as well as steering wheel. The radio control button is awful! BMW please! I also miss that beautiful vehicle information screen. Sound system just ok. Car has a little wind noise at speeds above 55 mph. City mileage 18-19 mpg. Highway 24-25 mpg so far.
car_117,Great vehicle except for the tranny,Just took delivery on an X3. The mileage has been a pleasant surprise. The vehicle is well built and feels very solid. The transmission is not up to par with the rest of the vehicle. It doesn't shift smoothly and hesitates.
car_118,LUVIT!,I always said I would NEVER drive an SUV!  I'm not.  I'm driving an X3 and it's probably the most fun and convenient car I've ever owned.  Normally those two words can't be used in the same sentence when describing a car. I'm disappointed in the gas mileage but other BMW owners seem to be fine with it.  The interior is divine!  Cup holder doesn't hold odd size containers but everything else is perfect!
car_119,Great SAV,"This is my second X3. Traded in a 2005. This is one of the best handling cars/SAVs out there. You just can not do better then the X-drive system. Get the 18"" wheels and Premium Pkge. The Xenon headlamps are great. I get 19 to 20 mpg driving to work, but if you drive around 70 mph you won't get 26 mpg."
car_120,SAV,"I purchased the X3 in Germany and have had the pleasure of driving 100+ mph on the autobahn for the last 3 months... sooo fun!!  Handles like a dream, both in snow and on dry pavement. Steering is quick and responsive.  The inside is roomy and quite comfortable.  The size is perfect... large enough to pack everything I need and more, yet small enough that parking (even in Germany) is no problem.  I didn't get the navigation system because I already had a Tomtom.  I ordered a side dash mount from ProClip so the GPS doesn't take up space on the windscreen and the placement is excellent.  Top quality vehicle!!"
car_121,What a change!,"I owned 3 Ford Explorers back to back. I test drove 2 BMWs, an Acura and Lexus. I found myself going back to BMW for a second test drive. I could not believe the handling and drive. I find myself amazed after 2 months each time I get into the car. I find myself uncomfortable when I drive any other car now as in maneuverability."
car_122,BMW Cut Some Interior Corners,"Time to downsize from Lincoln Aviator. '07 X3 is perfect size and 1/3 less to fill gas tank.  Fun to drive, agile, smooth and quick. Interior disappointing.  Have an '07 BMW 328xi and expected equivalent interior comfort features on X3 but BMW did not provide them: (1) heat/AC system is not dual, has no vent in rear seat, and no heat circulation when engine off; (2) leather/comfort of sport seats inferior to 3 series; (3) radio Bluetooth features are limited compared to 3 series; (4) heated seats weak. The iPod add-on connection is awful - can't hook-up while driving, shows ""Track #"" not song name, cord too short, takes glove compartment space - use standard auxiliary.  Park assist feature annoying."
car_123,Again,"I've just changed my 2005 X3 for a new one. The 2007 feels more comfortable, cleaner in style and a bit more powerful. Same old leatherette in the seats, but a sturdy more easy to manage leather steering wheel. Lets' put it this way: a nicer a gentler car!"
car_124,Utility Sportscar,"I bought this for my wife who is very difficult to please and was coming out of a 5 series wagon.  This vehicle does everything well and even she is impressed.  Most vehicles that are this much fun to drive are not at all practical, but this vehicle does it all.  Everything about it is top quality.  If you drive it, you will want to buy it.  Don't bother with the sports package.  The standard seats are more comfortable,  and the standard front facia is much better looking."
car_125,2007 X3,Very beautiful car on the outside. Gets pricey as you add on the options. Competitors offer more features.
car_126,"Great Vehicle, Great Price","I have owned my X3 now for several months. The performance is truly unbelievable!I traded in my 2000 ML320 only because the upkeep was becoming more than I was willing to pay. I am so glad I did, this is a much nicer vehicle at a better price. Almost ten thousand dollars less."
car_127,"Try it, you'll like it!","This one has it all, styling, handling, utility, safety and everything you would expect from BMW. I thought it was too overpriced until I drove it. It is but it is such a wonderful vehicle I thought I would give it a try and was amazed at the lease payments because the residual value is so high. I don't think you could find a better small SUV or SAV, as BMW dubs it. I love the size, it's agile and offers utility. It's definitely a sport ute!"
car_128,First BMW after One Week,Just bought this X3 last Saturday. It was a great experience driving it since this is the first BMW we own. The exterior and performance are perfect. The interior could be improved. We may know it more after we drive it more. Not so sure now about reliability and fuel economy.
car_129,Great vehicle,I just purchased this vehicle less than a week ago and I love it.  It drives great and no comparison from my last vehicle 2003 xterra.  The power is excellent and so far gas is good.  This vehicle I can handle having for a very very long time.
car_130,It is truly sporty with utility.,"It's hard to find fault with this one. It's stylish, has unique bells and whistles and performs while  providing utility and comfort. BMW truly is the ultimate driving experience. It far surpasses the Mercedes sports sedan I traded for it. The only other vehicle I've owned that compares to it is the BMW 5 series I once had."
car_131,Another great BMW,I just got this vehicle a week ago and I have to say it is amazing. I got it fully loaded with everything except the sport package. The interior and exterior quality is the best!
car_132,Down right AWESOME!,This is my first BMW and SUV - I love it!  Definitely a nice upgrade from a luxury sedan (previously had 2 Audis).  The ride is firm and sporty and the interior is plush.  Lots of power and sports car handling.  You owe yourself to take a serious look!
car_133,X5 goodbye,"Having owned two X5s I'm thrilled with the agility and the power response of the X3 - firm ride yes, but smooth and tight. A joy to drive - sporty and more enjoyable than our Z3 and our 325csi."
car_134,You have to drive an X3.,"I have a really loaded 2007 X3. It's an unbelievable machine. I buy new cars very frequently and have gotten kind of bored with them. The X3 has given me that teenage excitement of having a car again. I really enjoy driving it. Its acceleration, handling and braking are just awesome. All of the latest safety features are in it. The fit and finish are top notch. The leather interior is beautiful. The transmission can be used in regular automatic drive, sport drive and manual. Hands free communication and BMW assist are very convenient. The BMW is in a class by itself."
car_135,Just an amazing piece of machinery,"The title of my review says it all about the 2007 X3.  The exterior styling is just amazing.  I can't tell you how many people have come up to me after seeing the X3 and said to me ""hot car"" or some variation of that. And it's an SUV!! Performance is excellent, you really need to hold this baby back on the roads.  The new 260 hp engine is just perfect.  Handling is incredible too.  The interior is upgraded and beautiful.  You really feel molded to the seats, they are so comfortable. The X3 just exudes class in every way.  You just feel so great sitting in it, and driving it is just plain fun."
car_136,2007 BMW,"Fun to drive. Higher view position than sedan, and same comfort as sedan. Very smooth."
car_137,My first bmw,X3 2007 is nearly perfect with its new engine and transmission and improved interior. It is the best vehicle I have ever owned and I have been driving new mercedes since 1993.
car_138,Dream ride,The performance and driving experience has exceeded my expectations in the first week of ownership.  I like the sporty feeling and the acceleration response and the luxurious feeling.  I  am happy with the 25 miles/gallon on my first tank of gas.  It is a huge step up from my 04 325i that I still own. I am looking forward to a little snow at this point. Thanks from a happy bmw owner.
car_139,Amazing car,"I have only owned this car for 3 days but I already love, love, love it!  I previously had a volvo cross country wagon but wanted to sit up higher and have more pep.  This car really delivers! It is so well made and handles beautifully.  The drive is smooth, the seats are comfortable with great lumbar support, and the visibility is outstanding. Really a fun car to drive."
car_140,2007 BMW X3 3.0si,"This X3 rules in the mid size SUV market!  I had a 2004 X3 with the 3.0 this 3.0 is upgraded to 260 horses and it runs!  I have the manual and it says the 0-60 time is 6.8, with a K&N drop in I say my time is below 6.5!  This baby can run!"
car_141,New improved 2007 X3,"I had seen the reviews etc on the 06 X3 and since then, the interior has been vastly improved.  Super quiet. Driving is a dream. Quick acceleration, great gas mileage in these times of higher prices. I actually have more interior room than my 04 Durango. Great braking and 5 front airbags for safety.  This car is a head turner. Take a ride in one. When you return you will buy it!!"
car_142,Upscale SUV,Exceptional upscale SUV. Handles like a fine car but has all the advantages of an SUV.  Just purchased this SUV in late October but it has been a dream to drive. Interior has many improvements over previous years.  Higher quality materials used.  Also larger engine but with better mileage.
car_143,NEVER AGAIN!,"I've owned Infinity for years and thought it was time for a change and so got the BMW X3 35i....it's terrible!  The 'intelligence' that went into this design is incomprehensible.  The instrumental panel is nearly totally dark, I have to leave headlights on in the day time and even then it's hard to see....there is no separation for the navigation display to reduce lights when night driving, if you reduce display for navigation so you can see, the instrument dulls as well, meaning you cannot see how fast you are going.  There is virtually ZERO ability to see clock, temps or any other instruments...there is no display for tire pressure.  There are so many stupid things that the Germans missed with this, that as soon as my plates come in I am getting rid of it and going back to Infinity. Even hubby who is German says even GERMANS don't buy BMW because there are NO OPTIONS on the cars unless you pay outrageous prices for them.  Japan has it ALL OVER the imports from Europe in this regard...I rented a KIA that has more options and better visibility than this BMW...VERY unhappy. The gas tank holds about 14 gallons and so you have to fill up every three days, it's just a ridiculous car."
car_144,MY SEVENTH BMW AND LEAST FAVORITE,"I’m a 7-time BMW owner.  All 3-Series vehicles until now.  The X3.The X3 (I have a 2016 X3 AWD Gas) is my first South Carolina built BMW away from the 3-Series and the first non-German built BMW I have owned.  I learning to live with this non-luxury truck with its optional safety (by optional I mean sub-par headlights, no fender turn signals  and Goodyear run-flats).What a difference…  The anemic 4-cyclinder engine tries to move some 5,000 pounds around.  It struggles on hills (almost sounds diesel-like) but if you put the vehicle into what BMW calls the SPORTS MODE, performance will improve greatly because it cancels out (or re-directs) several short-throw gears on the transmission and the engine is married to the gearbox in a much faster pace (you will consume an extra 21% of fuel though).  The transmission is electronic.  I love it!  Responsive, fast, understanding of your needs and quick to the change by your demands.  Kudos to BMW for this system of near perfection and this same system really shows off its talent when used on the 3-series newer sedans or coupes (I’ve had loaners in the past).The parking brake is an electronic tab function.  Hold a TAB to place your X3 in the parking brake mode. BMW’s are usually like a train on rails.  Trains follow tracks.  You don’t drive or steer a train.  Trains are precise and follow a pattern.  Most BMW’s give you that same feeling of total control and responsibility.  The road is safely yours and if you get into a situation a BMW will get you out of it with plenty of power and precision steering.  Except for the X3 4-cylinder version.The X3 is a shoebox on wheels.  BMW has compromised safety where safety is now OPTIONAL instead of standard.  Be it cheap and yellowish basic headlights to turn signal indicators (side body panels) missing because you bought the wrong model.  Rim/Tire sizes being too small.  Backup camera or braking safety features all optional.  Simple safety no longer part of BMW standards.  Safety only available for sale.Expect cheap plastic seats called SENSA-TEC on entry level models (sometimes called Leatherette) that are miserable in comfort.  You’ll have to purchase the essential SPORT PACKAGE to get decent seats in leather and secured in comfort.  The rears are even worse making most park benches a luxury compared to the rear seats on a 2016 X3.Tires on the X3 are also downgraded to Goodyear’s (pending the model/version/year).  However, many cars on the dealers lot had Bridgestone’s (owned by Firestone) tires.  Pirelli’s should be on the X3 or a good second choice would be Michelin’s.  Once again, BMW downgrading the X3 to truck status.Ride quality is average.  We had to take off the ‘FRED FLINTSTONE’ Goodyear run flats and upgrade to the Michelin’s to get a better interstate ride.  It’s like turbulence over Florida sometimes with you sitting in the last row of the airplane. The X3 is stumpy, short and fairly boxy looking (whereas the X5 has a far classier look to it).  It bumps and it pulls and it fights the road when accomplishing interstate driving.Braking is average.  Not the soft and exact stopping that a BMW 3-series will give you but plan ahead and control your stop before you need to.  5000 lbs. is a lot a shoebox to stop.The Panoramic Sunroof is a must-have option and excellent in design.  It’s massive!  Back seat passengers especially benefit and it is a great distraction to the discomfort of those Spirit Airlines last row seats.  One of the better options available on the BMW X3.This is the most disappointing BMW I have owned to date.  Yet in fairness, my last BMW was a 335is convertible and now this is a totally, almost non-BMW truck experience.  We did a test drive of the RAV-4 before deciding on the X3 but when compared, the Toyota RAV 4 exceeded all handling and safety features when compared to the BMW X3 when factoring in price and reliability.  On the other hand, BMW paint and fit and finish was superior to Toyota’s cheaper paint and gel coating.   In just six (6) weeks, our rear hatch latch has broken off (it’s plastic instead of metal), we’ve changed out the bad tires, the driver’s side door won’t stay open, when opened (you have to walk it out into position) and of great concern is we had to accelerate this weekend to change lanes on an interstate and nothing happened.  Gas petal depressed fully.  No response.  Of major concern and to be looked at later this week.I’d never purchase another X3 BMW at any price.  Not a real German built BMW.  In fact, not the feeling of a BMW at all… If you decide on a X3, add the essential packages so that you’ll have the basic safety items now marketed only as options.  Going with the 35i X3 will provide for superior engine performance and adding a SPORTS PACKAGE above all will change the experience from rental car performance to some personal pride of ownership."
car_145,2016 BMW X3 Diesel vs GLK250,"Although I relay on feedback and reviews, it took a while to decide to write one. However, I wanted to write this review for people interested in diesel cars as I was, and there weren’t too many comments in regards to diesel engines. I was in search of a diesel car that will have a high MPG and be a little bit bigger than a sedan. I didn’t care about brands in the beginning knowing that I will sort it out at the end based on price/mpg/quality, etc.After narrowing down I ended up with 2 models: BMW X3 diesel and MB GLK250 diesel. I lived in Oregon at that time and the price in NW was higher than other areas. As I had time to search and not be in rush, I found a 2013 GLK250 in California @ $28K with 21000 miles on it. PURCHASE it for my wife.2 months later I found an X3 diesel in Texas @ 36K brand new, but with rear window busted by the hails. The dealer replaced the window for free, but I paid for fixing the wiring as the rain water affected the rear side. 1 year later, both cars have about 10k miles put on them, and I can say that MB is the best as performance. Acceleration: BMW is on 8 speed transmission and the car is slow until you reach about 30MPH. The ratio on speed changes is small and that will keep you slow. It is irritant to see all kind of other brands vehicles to be faster than your BMW car, from stop to 30-35 MPH. GLK250 instead is on 7 speed transmission but the ratio is distributed different and you have the starting speed what you’ll need. Comfort: BMW is better as the seats are a bit better built and placed. The infotainment system has more options (like a computer) while MB is pretty simple (for old guys like me).  MPG: I drove the BMW from Oregon to NY with constant speeds above 80 / 85 MPH and the MPG was about 30MPG. The driving comfort was ok as I drove about 12 hours / day. It bothered when I had to go to speeds lower than 30MPH as the transmission changed gears and it seems to not catch up speed at least as fast as other cars.  In the “city”: I did UBER/LYFT for about 6 months and I achieved about 28 MPG in a stop and go traffic about 8-12 hours/day (on the days I worked). During the winter (snow and ice) it performed excellent. No slips, plenty of torque on snowy hills. Now on the NY routes I am getting about 35MPG even more if there were no hills. The best was 45MPG on a 75 miles trip at 45-55MPH. The GLK250: most highway trips were between Portland and Seattle and the MPG was about 33MPG @ an average of 75MPH. In the city (stop and go) I am constantly getting about 30 MPG. But leaving from stop lights is a pleasure. NOISE: Definitely both cars are quitter than their predecessors and while running you won’t make the difference between the gas and diesel engines. However, GLK is at least 50% quitter than X3. Now if I would have to start shopping again, I will definitely not buy an X3 anymore, but 2 GLK’s. Unfortunately, MB is not making diesel mid-size SUV’s / cross-overs or at least this is what I know at this point. Breaks: I drove Toyota and Honda for many years, but BMW’s breaks are worst. You have to push hard on them is not like the other cars where you gentle push the breaks and stops without efforts. If you’ll check the forums you’ll see that breaks and rotors are a common problem for BMW’s. If you open up the CARFAX reports on autotrader, you’ll see that almost every 30k the pads/rotors were replaced. GLK has pretty much the same habit, but maybe at 45K…Hopefully this will help you take the right decision. Feel free to ask questions if you have [contact info removed]."
car_146,Fun to drive but...,"This is a well-equipped small luxury SUV or SAV as BMW calls it.  Fun to drive, easy to park, easy to load and unload groceries from the rear tailgate and there-in lies the problem.  The rear lift door develops a rattle and needs adjustment by the service department frequently.  My 2016 X3 has only 10K miles and has needed this adjustment twice in the last ninety days.  Service adviser said it is apparently  a design flaw and they are seeing the problem regularly.  For a vehicle that is marketed for it's quiet interior, this was very disturbing.  Love almost everything about this vehicle but the constant rattle from the rear lift door is extremely annoying."
car_147,Love my Beamer,Nothing really. I really enjoy this vehicle.
car_148,Delightful diesel,"I have been very pleased with this vehicle, having owned it for well over one year and adding 25K to the odometer.  While the diesel is slightly more ""clattery"" than the gasoline version, this is more than offset by the terrific fuel mileage.  I get over 36 miles to the gallon in mixed driving.  As diesels remain largely unpopular in the US, I got a fabulous deal on this car.  It was a service vehicle for the dealership with 3K miles when purchased, and I got 19% off the MSRP.  The car is tight as a drum and handles exceptionally well for a small SUV.  Performance is fine and the diesel is torquey and responsive.  The quality is palpable.  We are considering purchase of a second one for my wife."
car_149,You get more than you see,"We bought the X3d for several reasons 18 months ago.  1/ Diesel's are known for their good MPG, we get 33 mpg on and off HWY. We are not very often at the Gas Station and get an average 680 miles from empty to full.  2/. Servicing is only every 10,000 miles or 1 year and our Local BMW Dealership is only 10 miles from home. Very convenient.  3/. Insurance is reasonable and with all the safety aspects we get 36% discount.  4/. Road Side Assistance is all in for 10 years. Part of the deal.  BMW give you 4 years Free Maintenance  but we offered to pay for an extra 2 years having taken the finance over 6 years. Thus when we have to pay for 7th Maintenance our car will be paid off. The car is a delight to drive and the twin turbo kicks in well when needed. Snow and ice are no problem.  X3diesel is always going to hold a good resell factor as a good one is very hard to find. Wife has a mixed back roads and R93 to get to work and when there are delays the GPS finds a way for her for the 20 mile journey each working day.  Our back up car is a 2012 Acura RDX and on par with BMW X3d."
car_150,BMW X3,Compare
car_151,Small but BIG * Update,"I am still in LOVE with this vehicle, 6 months in. It seems I'm finding out something new it can do everyday! The technology in this thing is unbelievable. I have told all my friends to buy an BMW. I'm coming out of a Mercedes and after driving this, I will not go back to a Benz."
car_152,Not for everyone,"There are a lot a good features about the BMW X3, but overall if I had the decision to make all over again I would choose something else.  First the good things.  1) The power from the 3.0L turbo is very good.  It is refined and the transmission shifts smoothly.  2) The active stop and go cruise control is worth the extra cost.  When you are sitting stop and go traffic it is a wonderful feature.  3) Back seats and cargo capacity are very good for this class of SUV.  4) I-Drive is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  5) Heads up display is a great feature.  I have it on another car and think more vehicles should have this as an option.Now for the things that I am disappointed with after having this BMW for a few months.  1)  The upgraded Harmon Kardon system sounds just OK.  I had a Harmon system in a Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and it rocked in comparison to this system.  At louder volume levels the sound is a bit harsh.  2) The keyless entry system can be a bit flakey.   With the key in my pocket I have issues opening and locking the door.  I have to take the key out of my pocket to make it work.  I don't have this issue on my GM with a keyless system.   Plus for a vehicle of this price point, I think its kind of cheap to not have them on the rear doors too.  3) Both rear tail lights have flaws from the molding process.  I have looked at others and you can barely see the injection points in the lens, but mine stand out like sore thumb.  They look like white dots on the tail lights.  The dealer says they are in spec.  Again for the price of these SUV's is seams these could be made better.  4) Went I got it I thought the interior was nice and was fitting of the luxury brand.  But over time, some the materials feel cheep.  Even with upgraded leather, the ruff texture makes it feel like fake leather.  It was not until I got in my friends new Cadillac XT5 did I really notice the difference.   The Cadillac is light years ahead on interior quality.  I can feel the ruff seam on the top and bottom of the turn signal stalk where the two pieces of plastic meet.5) No vented front seats and power tilt/telescoping wheel.  A miss on this class and price point.6) Auto Start/Stop is poorly programmed.  Many times it stops the moment you stop.  There should be a couple of seconds delay.  When coming to a stop sign or switching gears while pulling into a parking space, I have had the engine shut off just to restart again while it was shutting off.  Then there are times when you think it should shut off and it does not.   I have stopped and put it into park and it won't shut off.  The only plus is you can disable the feature.  I highly recommend this if you have the A/C on.7) Front parking sensors are slow to engage.  Don't pull up to something quickly and expect them to be active.8) Having to hit the Start/Stop button twice to shut everything off is annoying.  Once to stop the engine the second time to turn off accessories.  If you don't the accessories stay on even after you open the door.  It will timeout once you have locked the door, but I don't trust it.  You should only have to hit it once to turn the engine off.  Then when you open the drivers door it shuts off the accessories. 9) It was not until I a took a long trip and my left leg started falling asleep how bad the comfort is on the bottom of the front seats.  They are not good.  The cushion is too short on the front and sides. 10) Just got the recall notice about the rear child safety seat anchor.  Give this vehicle is been on the market for a while I am surprised that this has come up this late in the product cycle.  What concerns me how they have to fix this.  They need to remove the rear seats and carpet, send it out a body shop to have a support bracket welded in.  Not liking the sound of welding something in a brand new vehicle.***UPDATE***I traded the BMW in after 6 months.   When you spend this kinda money on a car and are not happy with it you need to go with something else.   The something else is a 2014 Cadillac CTS Vsport with under 25K miles.   This is an amazing car.   Can't wait to get into it each day and drive.   This is what a luxury car should be."
car_153,Fantastic Driving Experience,Visibility is so good all around the BMW X3 MSport especially over the hood! The overhead camera is fab for letting you know when you are in garage/parking space! We drove from tn to Florida and experienced no stiffness. Love the leg extender in the msport. LOVE LOVE in fact we now have 2 of them.  Will never own anything else.  Service is great and included for 4 years.
car_154,Good SUV for the money,"Overall a very good SUV. The right size when you are limited by the parking space. Got basic xDrive28, just added leather, camera and 19"" wheels.Unfortunately the car is missing some basic options in base trim as for that price. I understand that you can get all that as packages,  but then price will jump too high:1) LED/HID headlamps 2) Intelligent key less entry (when you just touch the door handler).3) No lambda on front seats. Even headrest is only up-down now (used to be 4-way adjustable, it's still 4-way adjustable in 3-series in base trim) . I'm lucky the seat is comfortable for me, but you don't know until drove a long distance. Test drive won't show that.4) Blind-spot detectors.Other considerations:1) You will not like electric steering at least for a few weeks if you used to old-school BMW with power steering (I guess prior to 2012). After all it's not bad but definitely gives less steering feeling. 2) I still don't like sound of turbo-4. However it drives good, with adequate acceleration and fast shifting. And it doesn't loose power on high-way speeds.Complaints - I had certain lease issues with the dealership. Unfortunate BMW customers service didn't help me. I constantly was redirected between BMW and the dealership. I have to rate the BMW customers service as the worst I had to deal with."
car_155,Very very nice car,"Put on about 8700 miles so far.  It is such a pleasure to drive.  Our other car is a 2010 Acura RDX, and while it isn't completely fair to compare the two due to age difference, it is amazing how much more fun it is to drive the X3.  The car handles like a dream, cornering is a blast.  The acceleration is good but maybe a little too many gears for my taste.  Build quality seems great.  The interior is very lovely.  We got all the bells and whistles - favorite parts are the blind spot notification (which causes the steering wheel to shake when a car is in a blind spot and the turn signal is activated) and the overhead view that makes parking a total joy.  I HIGHLY recommend getting the overhead view add-on(friends are totally blown away when showing them this feature - it looks like a drone is flying over the car sending the video so you can see the parking spot lines)Car is expensive, sure...iDrive system blows, sure... but good golly is it a joy to drive.Likes:CorneringaccelerationInterior designExterior looks(xline package)Technology(driver assistance packages)Dislikes:iDrive system - not fun to use - wife hates it - I would rather have touchscreenRear seats don't fold flat limiting cargo spaceI wish there was an option to have the idlestop feature wait a second or two before shutting the car off - for when making left turns where you only have to wait a split secondWould also like the ability to make the ECO PRO mode be the default.  Having to turn it on every time you start the car is downright silly."
car_156,So far so great!,"I was considering the Audi Q5, Lexus NX200t and Range Rover Evoque before deciding on the BMW X3. I was almost seduced by the Evoque, but reading all of the owner horror stories scared me away. I took delivery of my X3 in December 2015 and have already put about 7500 miles on the vehicle. Thus far, the X3 has performed flawlessly and has not disappointed! Initial build quality appears to be worthy of the price tag.I've found the xDrive system to work very well on the road during inclement weather (heavy rain, light snow), although I did not have to put it to the test in deep snow. I do not have the Dynamic Handling Package, but given how well the X3 handles the road without it, I'm not really sure how much of a difference I might notice with it. I've read other reviews where some felt the ride was too harsh, but I don't share that opinion, although I do like to feel the road perhaps more than some might. The vehicle handles and accelerates so smoothly perhaps with the exception of the auto start/stop feature which can be noticeable at times. I leave it in the ""Comfort"" drive mode most of the time. I put it in ""Sport"" mode, when merging onto a freeway or needing to get through busy intersections when I need the extra burst of acceleration. I rarely use ECO Mode. I've found the gas mileage between ECO and Comfort to be relatively negligible and the gearing is just too dulled down for my liking in ECO mode. I've been averaging just over 23 miles per gallon for which probably 75% of my miles are highway.I find the interior of the X3 to be nicely appointed and up to standards of fit and finish for the class of vehicle. I find the seating to be comfortable and the climate control system to work very well. The Infotainment system menu is fairly intuitive and with a little playing around with it, you should be able to figure out most of the functions and settings in relatively short order. The iDrive controller is easy to use to navigate the control panel, but some of the buttons on the passenger side of the controller are hard to see from the driver's seat. The one function I haven't really used much is the voice command system, so I can't really comment to how accurately it works. The buttons and controls on the dashboard and steering wheel all seem to be well placed with proper tactile feel.In my opinion, there are a few ""must"" have packages to avoid buyer's remorse:* xLine or M Sport Package: I think either of those significantly enhance the aesthetics of the vehicle. I went with the xLine. I'm happy with it, but wish the Sport Seats that you get with the M Sport package was an available option.* Lighting Package: Recommend going with either the Xenon or Full LED. Either the Xenon or LED seem to throw a much brighter light and I personally think they look much better than the yellowish Halogens. I opted for the Xenon lights and am very happy with them.* Dual-Pane Moonroof (either as standalone option or part of the Premium Package). About as close to the convertible feel as you can get.As far as the other options go, I opted the following: Premium package, Technology package, Driver Assistance package, Driver Assistance Plus, Harman Kardon Sound System and Heated Front Seats. Unfortunately, in order to get certain features, you have to opt for entire packages. For example, if you want Lumbar Support on the front seat, you have to get the Premium package. If you want the Head Up display, you have to get the Technology package. The safety features are spread out between the Driver Assistance Package and Driver Assistance Plus. If you only want rear view camera and parking sensors, you can just opt for the Driver Assistance package. However, of all the available safety features, Active Blind Spot detection was most important to me so I had to select the Driver Assistance Plus package which also requires you to select the Driver Assistance package. I've found the surround view camera feature that is part of the Driver Assistance Plus package to be very useful as well. I'm hardly an audiophile, but the HK sound system sounds good to my ears. The Heated Front seats have 3 settings and heat up quickly.There are a few features missing that I would have liked to see available on the X3:* Full size spare or at least a temporary spare. This is my biggest gripe. My X3 came with run flats. There is no hole in the cargo area for any type of spare nor under the vehicle. I've seen aftermarket temporary spares available, but unless you put it on your roof rack, you have to put it in the rear cargo area which then leaves you with little cargo room.* Cooled front seats. I have black Nevada leather and would really have liked the option to have cooled front seats for the hot weather.* Auto-Folding Side Mirrors. The side mirrors do fold with the press of a button on the driver's side door, but why not fold automatically when the vehicle is turned off?"
car_157,I survived!,"I was hit on the driver's side door by an '01 Chevy Impala travelling at 45 mph ... and I walked away without a scratch! I was driving my 2015 BMW X3, so when I needed a new car it was a no brainer ... I bought a new 2016 BMW X3. Handles beautifully and is a real pleasure to drive.That was a year ago. I love driving my X3, it's fun and the right size for my wife and two labs. I'm leasing, but will likely buy this one or a new one in 2019. Highway mileage is great, but around town (most of my trips) only 22 mpg. Arguably the best vehicle I've ever owned!"
car_158,Love this vehicle,"Shop around. Visit a couple of dealerships first to get your best price. Packages can increase the cost quickly. Lighting package a must: headlights are phenomenal; Technology and Premium package a must. You do not need the rear camera or the blind spot package (unless you have small children at home)because the x3 has very good visibility on it's own. Very, very comfortable on long road trips. Love this vehicle. Very pleased, and fun to drive. The only thing: I wish it had a 5 star crash rating for the front passenger - it has a 4. This is my second bimmer. (My prior BMW was a 328iXdrive sedan with the M Sport package. Loved this one as well. I almost cried when handing it in at the end of the lease!.) A YEAR LATER: STILL LOVE THIS VEHICLE!"
car_159,Off to a great start,"I have a little over 600 miles on my 2016 X3 xdrive28d.  So far, I'm very happy with the vehicle.  I spend about 2 hours a day commuting and the X3 is a great place to be.  The 2L turbodiesel is not for racing, but it's plenty quick and accelerates to 70 mph effortlessly.  The computer is pretty accurate and mpgs are climbing, currently at 34 mpgs.  After adjusting the seats I find them very comfortable (Nevada leather).  The interior design is classy, although some of the buttons are difficult to see from the driver's seat.  The engine is not as quiet as my Q5 TDI, but you don't hear it cruising down the highway.  The car came with 18 inch wheels with Pirelli P7s and they are quiet so far.  The idrive infotainment system is complex, but most functions work by voice command and it works well.  The build quality is excellent and there are no rattles, even from the panoramic sunroof.  The suspension is firm, well composed and comfortable.  The auto Stop/Start works well and definitely saves fuel at those long traffic lights.  I do disable Start/Stop in sections where I know the stops will be brief.  I can't comment on reliability this early on.  I always look forward to driving this car."
car_160,Great ride but snug,"Super smooth suspension and torquey 4 cylinder 240hp.  Great handling on curves and visibility.  The cabin space is a little tight (I'm only 5'8"" 150#) due to the wide console.  Rest of vehicle decently fits family of 4 with car seats.  But, happy with fuel economy and most convenience features.  I would recommend it."
car_161,BMW needs to learn to design seats,"I leased a 2016 BMW X3 3.5 X drive with the M sports package for my wife. We were hoping to use the vehicle for a road car. I have tried to sit in the front seats of the car. They are abysmal. I do not feel my size is unusual at 6'2"" and 225 lbs. I am unable to sit in them for  more than 10 minutes without being very uncomfortable. In my 50 + years of sitting in automobile seats have never sat in the front seat of any model of any car or truck and been uncomfortable. If you are a person of small stature the seats in this vehicle are tolerable. Make sure any guest you will have in your X3 will be the same size. I sent an email to the BMW ""geniuses""  but have not gotten a response. My review of the BMW discussion groups shows this bad seat design in the X3 has been an issue for quite a while. If you are test driving this car you need to drive it for 15 to 20 minutes at a minimum. If you can't sit comfortably in the car to drive it, everything else about the car is meaningless. I would recommend any other vehicle than the X3."
car_162,I STILL got my BMW!,"After wanting a BMW for years and for many reasons not getting one, my wife said we should get rid of our current SUV...and BMW makes an SUV.  I would have accepted almost any BMW, but are now the proud owner of a 2016 x3 all wheel drive. If I lower the seats to its lowest position I feel I am driving a sports car! In reality I raise the seat about halfway and it feels like I driving a luxury car. We needed the space in the back and its very generous for the size of vehicle, and there is still plenty of rear seat legroom. Drives great, looks great and costs great but its worth it."
car_163,Outstanding car!,"My wife and I drove many cars before we decided to buy the 2016 X3, including Lincoln, Lexus, Infiniti, Cadillac. Not one of the others handled and accelerated like the BMW. The safety ratings on this car is better than the others too. The cost of the X3 was lower and the reviews from previous years we're very good and convinced us to buy it. This is a very fun and comfortable car to drive!"
car_164,Compared 7 Vehicles,"I reviewed information online for Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Audi, Acura and Infinity. I keyed on safety, reliability, gas mileage and costs. I test drove each of the vehicles twice and took notes about strengths and weaknesses. I narrowed it down to Lexus and BMW primarily because of driving comfort, interior features and how I was treated at the dealership. I drove each one more time and the BMW just handled better. The interior features (look, comfort and navigation controls) were great and easy to master. Final two items that convinced me to buy the BMW was the lower cost and great people throughout the dealership. I am sure that all the vehicles I mentioned are great but after thoroughly testing them all, the BMW just proved to be the best option for me. I have only had it for a few weeks but I am convinced that I made the right choice."
car_165,Somebody Stop Me (From Having So Much Fun),"What a great car ! My wife and I are older and used to have BMW'S when we were younger and it was easier to get into her Z3 and my 330I. After a few back surgeries, retiring to our beloved northern Minnesota,  and not having a dealer close by for service,  we traded the Bimmers in for Hondas. They are great cars too ! Her CRV and my Ridgeline are wonderful,  but she is so short that she had a hard time driving the Ridgeline.  We traded the Ridgeline in on this car because she can drive it easily and I missed the handling and just plain fun of a BMW. 'Nuff said . We have to go to Minneapolis for service ( it's 200 miles away ) but , we don't care.  Driving it there is a blast ! We have the 3.5l M ! For us,  it's doesn't get any more fun or comfortable !"
car_166,Bought this used with 80k miles on it...,"If you're reading this you're buying used... I gave my son my X5 with 170k on it and still running strong. I have a couple of Porsches that I'm trying to keep the mileage down hence the X3... It drives like a new car. It was well cared for and serviced. the car runs strong, smooth to drive and effortless on long trips. The key purchase point for me... it could handle a wet golden retriever full of sand, plants from home depot, bikes and surf board... all or 16k. I'll give this to my one of my kids when it hits 180k..."
car_167,I love to drive my BMW X3,"True leather seats, not the Nevada leather (terrible), will make a huge difference in how this vehicle feels as far as quality. I have true leather and have been in the vehicles with Nevada leather--so I recommend true leather absolutely. This vehicle handles so well. I drove some of the BMW cars and I think this vehicle feels better built and more solid. It handles and accelerates every bit as nicely as a BMW car in my opinion and is an absolute pleasure to drive.  It is just the right size, not too small or to large. There are few things to dislike. Fuel economy is not great but I wouldn't want the solid feel and weight of the vehicle to be compromised in an effort to obtain better mileage. My only concern is BMW's track record with reliability/cost of repairs. I am simply not in a position to handle the costs involved for the type of repairs I know come up for too many BMW vehicles. I plan to trade the vehicle in after my extended warranty 100,000 miles is up. I would consider another going with another X3 with the extended warranty to cover repairs and maintenance."
car_168,love hate relationship,"I bought the car brand new in 2011. I love how this car drives.  Super fun and sporty. Hands down there is nothing on the market to compare to this little turbo six. Hence the love part. The hate part is the water pump going out with only 45,000 miles on it costing me over $1000. to fix.  Constantly having battery problems with it in the cold winter, tail lights going out. The mechanic told me to save my money cause that""s how BMW's are.  It's a high maintenance car but a blast to drive.  It will be going down the road soon and will not be replaced by another BMW. I'm just not into the high cost of the maintenance regardless of how fun the car is to drive."
car_169,Worst BMW ever,"I bought this vehicle use with low mileage only 28,000 miles at 52000 miles I spent over $3,000 and work some of the work was covered under warranty the alternator let go it has a front engine crankshaft seal leak check engine light went on like 3 times and check battery and low control system 2 at the dealership could not find anything wrong with it air flow sensor damage when to replace it with a 2013 but they have a 4 cylinder turbo engine for a vehicle that weight of a 3000 pound what's going to happen 5years down the road I would not recommend BMW to anybody"
car_170,"Over 130,000 miles and still going strong!","Really a great SUV.  Great visibility, great looks, strong powertrain, extremely functional, appropriate repair/maintenance costs.  The in-line six cylinder engine is very strong and reliable.Two notable repairs.  Replacement of water pump and supply/return hoses at 99,000 miles (covered under extended 100k warranty).  Replacement of intake air valve actuators at 125,000 miles.  This was a tricky problem that local BMW dealer could not figure out, but independent BMW shop did.  Normally scheduled maintenance, tires and brakes.  No oil leaks.  Great 8-speed transmission that continues to shift strongly and crispy.  Zero problems with electronic all wheel drive system.  Getting ready to replace struts, control arms and tie rods at 150k.Squeaks and rattles are worse than expected.  We've had 20"" wheels with low profile tires, so this might be responsible for beating up the vehicle over time.I despise the navigation and Bluetooth.  Navigation is ""much dumber"" and ""much slower"" then iPhone Maps.  Bluetooth constantly loses pairing.  Callers on other end of phone calls cannot hear you talk at all.All-in-all very happy w the X3.  Would buy another one, except for the fact that this one is paid off and running very strong."
car_171,x3 needed new transmission,Bought it used at carmax with maxcare warrantyAfter 1 year using the car the transmission broke and need a new one($9000.00).Max care warranty don't wanna pay for a new one.They will put a used one instead.It was supposed to be done in a week and took a month.Of course because of their fault i will have to pay for all this time the rental car.The on;y pay for 7 days of rental.First they don't agree with the Bmw dealer than i have to tow to their mechanics and they send a supervisor and try to cut corners giving me a used transmission.Next time i will buy Cpo from the Lexus that is the most reliable brand.The Bmw X3 is excellent but unreliable.
car_172,First German car.,"So I want to start off with that I’ve never owned a German car before. So my notes and my review will be coming from that stand point. This information will hopefully help those thinking of buying a used BMW.Car facts:One ownerNo accidentsNon smokerMillage was: 33374Bought the X3 from a non BMW Dealership but it wasn’t one of those used car lots.BMW warranty had run out (due to over 4yrs)Bumper to bumper warranty (would only cover 6 years from when the car was originally bought so only about 1 yr and 9 mnths) it cost a lot about 4k so said noMaintenance warranty was about 3k (would only cover 6 years from when the car was originally bought so only about 1 yr and 9 mnths) so said noMy thinking is that in 1yr and 9 mths I shouldn’t rack up over 7k in repairs and if it starts down that path we will have to get rid of it.The car was clean inside and out no body damage and no accidents. Only 2 issue with X3 1) the glove box cover had been pulled up from the lower left corner not sure how this happen but the Dealer agreed to repair it as part of the we owe you agreement 2) the dealership had changed the oil and fixed the breaks but the lights hadn’t been reset and since they are not an BMW dealership they said they can’t reset those service lights. So part of that we owe you agreement they said they would get that all fixed and reset.Why did I buy the X3?I test drove and looked at all the other competition I was looking for an all-wheel drive SUV for the wife something upscale. I narrowed it down to the X3, the Q5 and the RX and we went with the X3 due to price and the mileage and the car was a 1 owner car.Thoughts so far only have had it for a week but so far so good. No issues. Took the X3 in to get the “We owe you” repairs done. I will try to update as things happen.  If you guys have question I will try and answer."
car_173,"Another ""like it but""","Comfortable, largely well-handling and a great value vs. our previous series of Jeep Cherokees. BUT, despite three ""re-programs"", acceleration after slowing is tortoise speed (a full three second delay before the trans kicks down) making high speed merges a gamble. Also hate the electronic parking brake which eliminates the safety of a manual parking brake backup. It is either on...or off. Finally, my wife just bought a new Honda CRV. For slightly fewer dollars, it is utterly loaded with convenience and safety features from auto tailgate to rear-camera to lane departure and blind spot warnings, etc., etc. relative to the X-3. I realize the vehicles are six years apart in age....but jeeze!"
car_174,I like it but...,"2011 X3 35I is my first BMW, I am a Honda Accord 3.0 6 cylinder regular.X3 is a beautiful, fun to drive small SUV.Its quick at high speed.It has roomy interior, front and rear.Good sound system as well as the blue tooth phone interface.This vehicle is really for luxury and not an economical alternative."
car_175,Poor handling,"Has anyone experienced this issue and was there a resolution to this SUV's poor handling stability?I used to own a 2008 X3 which had the traditional great performing stiff hydraulic power steering, now this X3 comes with some kind of ""electric"" assist on steering which may or may not be the cause for an unstable ride when driving on uneven pavement (especially wheel gutters from nordic states spring thaw).The car is simply unstable in its direction, it feels like you constantly need to fight the direction with oposition move on steering wheel to prevent it from swaying to right or left.Does this sound familiar to anyone?Please help, this car is great otherwise."
car_176,INSANE,I just don't even know where to begin with this hunk of [non-permissible content removed]!!First I'll start by agreeing with every negative comment I've read on this review board.Just purchased this junk on wheels less than one year ago and its already going back to BMW for service for the fifth time!I had to bring the car in for its first service owning it for three days.Little did I know this was just the beginning.PLEASE PLEASE listen to all the reviews on this board.Consider something else!!!
car_177,Best SUV in the Market.,I have owned this car for 11 months and put on 14200 miles on it. I have driven all four seasons now and can say that this is the best SUV I have driven. Performance is Awesome. I would say that BMW has built this like a mirror of your mood. If you slam on the gas it is the fastest with accurate handling control with (17mpg). My friends say that they could see a big difference in my driving style. If you drive it slow you get the best possible mileage (31 mpg). I drove 270 miles non stop and I looked fresh as I started to drive. Get the Premium Audio and it is one of the best&Every Penny is worth it.If you get this car from a reputed dealer it will not disappoint you.
car_178,I got a lemon.,"I bought a brand new 2011 BMW X3 XDrive 35i from Autorgemana in Medellin, Colombia and I got a lemon. 1) The sunroof didn’t work. It took 6 months to replace everything and still makes a clunking noise when it opens. 2) when you step on the brakes the car shakes. It was at the dealer 3 times and they couldn’t give us a correct solution. They replaced all 4 disc brakes, pads and sensors. 3) The headlights fog up inside even if it doesn’t rain. They haven’t been able to figure out why this happens so they said it is normal and a year later still happens. 4) The steering system was broken. It went to the shop 3 times and it took 8 months to replace it. As i write this, my car is 14 months old, it has 14.800 kms and it is in the shop for the twelfth time. I named it St. Joseph because it goes from the shop to the house and the house to the shop."
car_179,"I like it, but...","I am in month 10 and while I love the incomparable BMW handling, every time I drive it I am frustrated by the unnecessarily complicated shifter and the door locking system.I would not buy this car again if it had the same awkward shifter or if the door locking could not be reprogrammed.I am constantly pulling on locked door handles, but have been told by my dealer that this cannot be changed for safety reasons.Funny that Lexus does not have that concern.I also don't like the navigation display.Not enough street names are clearly identified and the background colors make it hard to read.By comparison, my wife's Lexus SUV has a dazzlingly clear and complete navigation screen."
car_180,"Will not start, louisy Customer Service","The car only has 300 miles and the battery died three times!Dealer (Motorweks) claoims everything is according to specs and battery runs down because of all electronics and that I must drive the car 3-4 times a week or use a trickle charger at all times!!! Contacted BMW customer service and they send me a standard staementthat they bild ""The Ultimate Machine"" and that I must contact the dealer.I asked if I must take a very long extension cord for the charger when I travel for more that afew days but no one thinks it is funny!Would seem to me that electronics can be interlcked with the start switch so the only run when car is started???"
car_181,Very Nice,"One thing I can say is that the X3 drives like a sports car.Handling is exceptional as is its acceleration.The turbo engine and 8-speed transmission are a great marriage.Its power deliver seems limitless.Yet, the the ride is smooth and composed.It can be very relaxing when you want it to be and a canyon carver when your in the mood.I really this like this little SUV a lot - mainly because it doesn't feel like one, if you know what I mean.The navigation screen is a wide screen set up allowing for maps to be displayed beside radio stations/songs/artwork if you like it that way. The standard stereo system sound very good as well.So far, seven months and no problems."
car_182,2011 BMW X3 xDrive28i,This is my first BMW.I've had the car for 5 months.I previously owned an Infiniti FX35.I like the X3.The feel on the road is nice and solid.Heated steering wheel is great in cold temps but the location of the button sucks.BMW could improve their ergonomics and sound system.The iPod connection system has a mind of it's own.The sound system in my Infiniti had better sound.I love the look of his car from the front.$1200+ for a trailer hitch is a joke.Yakima and Thule does not have a roof rack compatible with this vehicle.Initial acceleration is a bit slow at times which is weird for a car that claims the Ultimate Driving Experience.
car_183,I'm very picky and I love this car.,"I drove my past car for 12 years because I never like anything else enough to buy it. I waited for this X3 to be available hoping that I would like it.I am so happy I waited.I Love It!I got it loaded with sport package, tech package, convenience package, cold package.I have 6000 miles on it and I haven't had any problems.I do have a broken spring in a cup holder as someone else mentioned, but that is minor.I love all the technology and the comfort.I had a difficult time deciding what color to get; I thought they could have had better colors to choose from.I got Mineral Silver with Beige Leather and I am happy with it."
car_184,Major problems with the 2011-BMW-X3,"The vehcile is great when it works.I have had major problems with the 2011 X3, vehicle is less than 6 months old:1-Engine coolant leak, cracked reservoir. BMW said it's normal at first, then repaired upon insistance.2-Driver's door does not open, broken cable.3-Excessive brake noise and squealing, BMW says it's normal.4-Excessive wind noise from poor outside door seals, BMW says it's normal.5-Grinding window noise when closing/opening window.6-Windshield wipers do not rest in their low position, they sit up.7-Passenger's side door was misaligned and sticked out, BMW said it's normal, then attempted to fix upon insistance.All parts take 2-weeks to come !!!"
car_185,First time BMW owner,"Best SUV period.Drove the Mercedes GLK (nice SUV, styling inside and out a little old fashion), The Audi Q5 (excellent exterior looks, interior is very nice, steering felt odd within an unusual firming up - 2nd place choice) and the Acura RDX (very agile, nice steering feel but needs to be quieter on the highway).The turbo X3 was the clear winner for me.Smooth, yet sporty ride, very quiet, nice engine note, business like interior, excellent cargo space, the engine and transmission work flawlessly together (except for initial acceleration from a stop which takes some getting used to) and acceleration is unmatched by any in the class."
car_186,BMW has lost their quality,"I've owned 4 BMW's and this will be my last.There is a problem with the transmission that BMW knew about and didn't fix.They continued to make cars with this problem.When the car is not on, you cannot put it on neutral.Which means you cannot tow your car.I have only had this car for 7 months and I've had to tow it 2 times.They do not provide you with a spare tire.I got a flat and had the tow the car to the dealership.The run flat tire feature did not work.Why pay more if you get less?I would not recommend this car to anyone."
car_187,"My new X3....Next time, maybe I will buy a Hyundai","I would like to know why I could go purchase a $14K Hyundai w/ less problems than I have in my $55K X3....1.Cup holder – Has a broken spring mechanism 2.Heater button – When pushed, it went into the bottom of the center counsel. 3.Gas cap – It states “diesel” but the car uses gasoline. 4.Alignment – The vehicle consistently pulls slightly to the right.5.Owners manual states there is supposed to be a first aid kit, pg 232. None.6. Squeak - Sounds like styrofoam rubbing together.7.Jerky start - seems like the fuel pump/injector issue BMW has been having.Utterly disappointed with this vehicle...."
car_188,Love our X3,"We selected the X3 i2.8 at the end of our 2008 335 Convertible lease.You might think that after driving at 335 the X3 would be a disappointment; on the contrary, it's a much nicer car to live with.The 335 was fun, but somewhat impractical and had a very rigid ride; the X3 is surprisingly smooth and agile.We chose the 2.8 because, frankly, we had problems with the 335 engine... had to tow it back to the dealer with less than 20K miles.The 2.8 has plenty of power for ""real-world"" driving.It is smooth and sporty.The interior is quite large considering the external size of the the vehicle... especially the rear seat (compare it to the Mercedes GLK350)."
car_189,Love the X3,"I have owned my X3 for about 6 weeks and have 3000+ miles.It is comfortable, quite and a hoot to drive.The gas milage is great and big step up from my previous V8 SUV."
car_190,My new X3,"I just bought the car a week ago. I notice this car is having problem during low speed, stop and go condition, you can feel the transmission is shifting hard from 1st to 2nd gear under slight acceleration and this is really annoying during traffic jam."
car_191,My first BMW,"We have owned this vehicle just over six weeks andabsolutely love it. The style, RIDE, performance and MPG is as advertised. We test drove several other models and kept going back to the X3. Plus it's built in the USA and even my last Chevy was not. A little expensive but with their warranty and my lower mileage, it just made sense."
car_192,First SUV -It's a Good One!,"I wanted something different in my next car. Have been driving BMW's for 15+ years - mostly 3 series an M's. Test drove the new X3 35i and was smitten. Wanted to buy it there on the spot but the dealership didn't want to sell it to me so I went looking. Found one at another dealership. Had 1 option I really wanted (HiFi Stereo) but soon realized I could live w/o it. This is my first SUV (SAV) and I'm enjoying it very much. Not agile as a 335i - but darn close to it, especially with adjustable chassis and throttle settings. Getting 26.6mpg average. VERY impressive. Got that with my last 335i. Comfortable; Quite and Fun!!Get one!!"
car_193,"The ultimate driving machine, SUV edition","We have had this car about 2 weeks.While not as fun to drive as our 335 coupe was, it is great for an SUV.It is faster than every competitor except itself in the turbo version.The seats are supremely comfortable and it has lots of cool storage features.We only got this because we needed a 4 door car, but we have been pleasantly surprised by how much we like it, since we are sports car people.Except a Porsche Cayenne S, nothing else even comes close to this."
car_194,Driving machine,"bmw x3 35 i 2011nice SUV to ride. I trade of my Jeep 2008 hemi v8 for bmw x3. good mileage about 18 in city. very handy to drive oncity roads. lots of features, but very expensive compared to america cars with all those options.never mind bmw is much fun to ride than jeep.and only good aboutjeep is it was to good on heavy snow roads."
car_195,My new X3,"We took delivery of our new X-3 at the BMW Performance Center, Greer, SC.Anyone buying a new X-3 should take advantage of this opportunity, it was first rate.Our X-3 had the convenience package, premium package, tech package, and sports package.I wish BMW made more use of buttons than depending on the Idrive but it works well with a cutting edge car.I have test driven several X-3's over the years and found the ride to be choppy and the cabin less than comfortable. All has changed for 2011. At the performance center, we had the opportunity to drive the X-3's (theirs) at the edge of their performance envelope which demonstates how well these cars can perform.Pricing was negotiable!"
car_196,sets the bar above the rest,"total redesign for 2011, the exterior a perfect balance between what sporty and luxurious should be. driving impressions feel solid and responsive. powerful v6 engine even for the 28i model. interior design and technologies completely brought up to date, unlike many luxury car makers whos interiors look like from 1985. idrive is improved but still too many sub menus, somewhat difficult to adjust while driving. priced slightly higher than competitors but well worth the money. you wont be disapointed."
car_197,John s toy,Good insurance breaks
car_198,Love the X3,Perfect size - not to big or small.  Love all the technology - satellite orientation including view for parking.  Love the BMW ap for ease in destination info from my calendar.  Love the “heads up” info in the drivers view on the front window. Very comfortable seating w/ plenty of room in the back seat. Includes CarPlay for integration with my iPhone! Best of all our experience with purchasing the vehicle  at BMW was exceptional - no “car salesmen” mentality or pressure.  Appreciated the visit with their BMW ‘Genius” to go over all the technology and bells/whistles.  He answered all our questions and went over everything in approachable manner. Driving the X3 is a great experience.
car_199,What a monumental letdown,"This is not a swipe at the price of the car or the dealer. I got a very good deal and the dealer was entirely professional. This X3 xdrive is an enormous disappointment though and honestly borders on feeling unsafe to drive. Why? The steering is so bizarre it's hard to keep the car in your lane without having it wander unexpectedly. After it does you correct but small corrections do nothing and larger ones over compensate so you need to correct again. This is constant and driving takes a ton of concentration as you're always fixing the direction of the car. Ever have a bicycle where the steering stem was loose and when you turned the handle nothing happened? That's what driving this car feels like. There's also no digital speedometer and a hard to read analog one so you never really know how fast you're going. Oh you can pull up the trip mileage MPH so you know how fast you went last year but you can't know how fast you're currently driving. I guess that's not important. Then there's the low on gas warning light which is a small triangle (about 1/8"") that's so dim you'll never see it in the daylight. The fonts on the dash are small and hard to read, the heater seems to only heat at the highest setting and anything below it blows cold air. Mine has rattles and squeaks. I'm shocked that any car company let alone BMW would put out a car like this in 2017 and shame on me for not doing more homework before buying. Not my first BMW but certainly my last."
car_200,All is not Perfect!,Vehicle weighs almost 5000 pounds and feels very solid.  Finish is second to none.  Steering lacks a road feel and high crosswinds cause vehicle to wander; I long for rack and pinon steering instead of electric assist!  Interior controls take time to learn what to do.
car_201,A mediocre car in drag as a luxury vehicle.,"What happened to BMW? The steering is dead numb, the handling is ponderous, and the interior is cheap. And they want how much? Other than acceleration, I can't think of one thing this does better than a Mazda CX-5. And the design is clunky. I'm no BMW hater; I have bought 8 new BMWs over the past 20 years. But this one does nothing for me. Ultimate Driving to the Mall Machine."
car_202,Loving my new X3!,"I recently purchased the BMW X3 x28i. I'm very happy with my purchase and had a terrific experience at McKenna BMW. Love the comfort, style, entertainment features, and materials."
car_203,"Tons of ""Alternate Facts"" with these reviews.","First, WARRANTY for 2017 and all previous generations is 4 years or 50,000 miles. Maintenance is 3 years or 36,000 miles. The driving safety features like blind spot assist work at any speed, not just over 35 mph. Saab vs. BMW, you got to be kidding me, but I'm not surprised given the extreme loyalty Saab drivers have with their cars. But you cannot compare the two in pretty much every way. BMW's iDrive is way more advanced than any radio/information center ever put into a Saab. Maybe that's the problem, the BMW is too advanced for you. It sounds like some of the issues with the negative reviews were as a result of a poor delivery experience. The issues discussed could have been easily remedied if you had a delivery that showed you how to use the iDrive system. There are so many easy ways to customize the iDrive system and the options to do so are rather endless. If you're not sure how to find something, just ask the voice commands as you can literally ask it to do anything. And the best part with the iDrive system is there no lag with waiting for info to load, like the Mercedes command center. I suggest talking to your BMW service center and arranging for another experience. Oh, and there is no BMW Complaint option in the iDrive. The X3 performs better than the suggested EPA, and I usually 7-10 over the speed limit. The seats are super comfortable, offering good support. And for someone who is interested in keeping as good of posture possible, these seats will do the trick because they are firm and offer many adjustments. The x3 28i will not blow  you away with its power but it is more the sufficient when power is needed, especially for every day driving. Plus, I'm not buying a SAV to drive crazy and super fast, so this engine is perfect. Awesome ways to adjust the 2nd row to put all 3 seats down or any one of the 3 down for added cargo storage. This is the first SUV/SAV my boyfriend will drive because it drives like a sports car and doesn't look sissy."
car_204,BMW X3,Only two things are worth mentioning: gas mileage on high way is about 24.25; I anticipated 28 to 30; front seat is a little uncomfortable on long trips. other than that we love the car.
car_205,It's no Saab,"The menu system on a BMW dashboard is not intuitive - it’s just a random annoyance that’s the most consistent feature of this vehicle for a driver.  With three clicks, you can turn it off, but it won’t stay off.  Every time you start the vehicle, it will come back to annoy you – first with a legal disclaimer and then an array of meaningless menu choices.  It’s impossible to make the screen display something useful like a digital clock (a Kia will do that, but a BMW won’t).  I’d settle for a BMW logo on the screen, but even that’s not an option.The menu is loaded with choices leading quickly to lots of useless information, but changing the audio source for the stereo is 3-4 clicks and a couple of knob-spins away.  You’ll find the FM/HD radio choice is in a different section of the menu than the CD player and Bluetooth devices.  Perhaps it’s just German humor.Info that’s more easily accessed includes the owner’s manual (should you be reading that on the dashboard while driving?) and contact info for the BMW complaint center (maybe BMW owners use that one a lot?).  You can also schedule a service appointment with a random BMW dealership with just a couple of clicks.  But they can’t fix your menu.Want to “search by picture” and learn more about “screw thread for tow fitting” on this car’s front bumper?  That’s literally choice #3 of 12 on an image of the vehicle, just two clicks and a quarter-spin away.  But once again – is this info you should be using while the vehicle’s moving?  However if you need to call your spouse, plan on pulling over to the side of the road and scrolling through the alphabet, because the “favorites” from your iPhone will not upload to this system and the voice-dial feature is erratic at best.I like a lot of things about my 2017 BMW – great steering and acceleration, quiet and steady ride, nice lines, quality trim everywhere.  But the stupid, amateur-designed, useless menu stuck in the middle of my dashboard is a daily irritation that won’t go away.  Yes, I’m a little obsessive – but how many non-obsessive people buy BMWs?  I owned three Saabs.  This is my first BMW and my last."
car_206,Upgrade from X1 to X3,"This is a wonderful car to drive!  I was looking at the X1s first.  I did a lot of research, read all kinds of reviews and took several test drives in the X1.  I had made up my mind and had an order all written up for the color and options I wanted.   The dealer was shooting a commercial on their 2016 service loaners with big markdowns and under 5K miles.  I asked its they were leasable.... not the 2016s but they had a couple 2017 service loaners that were.....  for the same lease price as the less equipped X1!  I took one for a test drive.... so much nicer and more comfortable than the X1.  I changed my mind and leased the X3 right then and there!  It is a comfortable, quiet and really fun to drive SAV.  Plenty of power and good gas milage too.... amazing!  Some long trips coming up and this will make them much more enjoyable.  Just go drive one!  I came off a Ford Escape lease and moved up to the X3.  The price difference really isn't that much for the big step up in comfort, quality and drivability."
car_207,Great to drive but safety features lag behind,"We bought drivers assistance plus package to include blindspot, lane changer warnings but they only activated at 35 MPH so driving locally do not work. The driver siide definitely has a blindspot on the left side but blindspot only works at the higher speeds and the navigation package was pre-requisite. All in all, a waste of $3,000."
car_208,"Great car at the start, then not so good!","My initial love for my X3 turned to pure utter disappointment with the car, the dealerships and BMW U.S.A. within six months of ownership. Rides, drives and handles fine but that's about it. Broke down twice before 15,000 miles with fuel injection and electronics problems. Had to be towed out of my garage! They got it running again but wouldn't fix the console control buttons that were sticking because they said I must have spilled something on them. Wrong, I am so careful with this car I won't allow liquid anywhere inside it. Dealer said they'd be glad to fix them for $$841! Decided to cancel my extended warranty as it was clear to me that I wasn't going to keep this car beyond it's factory warranty period, even though the factory warranty turned out to be pretty useless anyway. I followed the cancellation instructions as provided in the booklet and it took seven months to get my money back and they shorted me $350 despite California law prohibiting any deductions if cancelled within the time frame that I did it. Dealers were awful  and B.M.W. U.S.A. even worse. Can't wait to get rid of it and buy a Subaru Forester, which I never should have sold in the first place."
car_209,Finally found the right vehicle,"I love this vehicle!  I have the x3 v6 msport.  Purchased in July last year and have about 6k miles.  It's so quick, it hugs the road, corners extremely well, and is so fun to drive.  The interior is comfortable and the technology was very easy to figure out.  I have a 4 year 50k warranty bumper to bumper.  The maintenance program went to 3 yr 36k for the 2017 model year, but ok with me.  I test drove so many vehicles before deciding and couldn't be happier with my choice."
car_210,5th BMW,love the fact that a lease from BMW means no cost basic maintence
car_211,Careful with this one,"Technology controls are counter intuitive, hard to get used to and learn.   Miles per gallon 12? A bit low expect high gas bills.  Not all options working as they should and cannot be tested. Car is supposed to be highly customizable but isn't for some desired features.  Why should dealer tell you tires are run-flats that cost $200 only after the car was sold."
car_212,BMW X3 M Package,"The previous reviewers of the BMW I believe are incorrect. BMW still has a 4yr/50,000 bumper to bumper warranty but for 2017 the included service or maintenance is only covered for 3/36,000. That is the main reason I wrote this review to clarify that. I have only had the X3 for 3 weeks and only driven it 300miles mainly because I own a Nissan Leaf and the 2 year free charging ends for me at the new year so I drive my leaf whenever I can. I can say that I seem to really love the BMW. I like nice things and new technology  and have had several loaded Kia's in the last 5 years because I got a lot for my money and didn't care what other people thought. My 2015 Sorento SX was loaded and I do miss my remote start already which was not an option on the BMW for all the things you can get. But I will say that everything just feels and sounds better in the BMW. Is it $10,000 better I can't say yet but for me if I am going to pay $550 to $750 to own not lease a car it is worth it imo to love what you are driving. I did love my Optima SX with the 2.0 turbo and it was only $400 per month with 0% interest but sometimes you just need to fit something more than you can in just a rear seat pass thru. I really didn't do much research before I bought it on Black Friday and  got $2500 off msrp and $1000 BMW rebate/cash/credit whatever you want to call it. So for the last 3 weeks I have been watching reviews and reading up and I can say I don't have any buyers remorse. The only thing I am used to is 0% with Kia and my Nissan but I guess 2.9% for 72 is the best BMW usually offers. I wanted the M Sport and a few other options. There were a lot of vehicles to chose from but only a few with the M sport package. I actually went in looking at the X1 because it really isn't that much smaller and the price was less. The 2018 X3 will be all new and probably larger to make it more different from the recently upgraded X1. I am happy to buy at the end of the current models cycle because hopefully all the bugs are worked out. The only X1 they had with the M sport was loaded with 2 packages I didn't want and was the great BMW astral blue but not my first choice. Nearby was the X3 I ended up with for only $4000 more and still over loaded but it had the 20"" M sport staggered wheel package that just makes it look so much better. I checked the price of replacement tires because I don't want to pay $300 or more for a tire but found  great options that are not run flats but will get a spare and take care of that down the road. I drive my cars close to the limit and I ride sport bikes and of course I have not driven the X3 even close to max because it is not even close to being broken in but what I have noticed is that when you push it just a little it seems fine and enjoyable but the next level it I think it will be not quite as enjoyable. Should I have gotten the 3.5i with the adjustable suspension maybe but at close to $56,000 there are a lot of other performance options out there. I think my biggest complaint will be with the 8 speed Auto trans instead of some of the dual clutch auto's available. Manual is not an option for me because of other drivers in my family not to mention I prefer to concentrate more on my lines and braking etc. than shifting. In sport it seems to hold the gear to long and doesn't seem to read your mind and once it does shift its brisk but jerky. Maybe it will get better when it learns my habits but I think it will be in comfort or sport plus where you have to shift up or down yourself when I am alone. I think if the car is problem free I will keep it and add the Dinan computer upgrade dealer installed and doesn't void the warranty that adds over 40hp and 40 ft/lbs of torque at the wheels and get coil over suspension that I can slightly lower the X3 and have adjustable rebound dampening to make an even firmer but not to stiff of a ride. Another thing I like is I see a lot of X3's x1's and X5's but not to many with the M package or the nice rims. Mostly x5's so it looks different from most out there without customizing."
car_213,People shouldnt buy BMW anymore,"The car still costs the same, but the warranty drops from 4 years 50k to 3 Years 36K. Shame on BMW. I will Switch to a different model after my lease. I had already switched one of my vehicles. Shame on you again BMW."
car_214,POCKET ROCKET,"I own a 2004 x5 v8 which I passed on to my son, Pretty good performance, and utility, and durability. I started shopping 6 months ago for a new vehicle. and I drove everything before returning to BMW ( I had a loaner x3 w/ 2.8 engine , and felt it was ""pokey"")  So this time, I tried a 2017 x3 3.5 xdrive WITH M Sport package- I am a big fan of the seat cushion extension- and WOW. This machine really moves. I feel like the Little Old Lady From Pasadena- except I am 70, & living in Scottsdale. I can't say enough good things about this vehicle. Perfect for me at 6'3"" , and I can haul lumber, boxes, whatever. The styling is great too. Worth the $$. Tony."
car_215,Disappointed!,"2017 BMW'S ONLY COME WITH A 3 YEAR 36,000 MILE WARRANTY VS. PREVOUS YEARS 4 YEAR 50,000 WARRANTY!!!!!  ALSO, NO SPARE TIRE!! WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A FLAT TIRE ON A SUNDAY OR HOLIDAY? I JUST READ ONLINE THAT THE WARRANTY IS. OT TRANSFERRABLE! Think twice before buying a 2017 model!"
car_216,Love this car,Get ride of the run flats.   If you like to drink coffee this is not the car for you.
car_217,Worst Purchase I've ever made,"1.	Dealership was a joke to work with, lied on two separate occasions about frivolous things.2.	Electronics keep tripping – Dealership has no idea. It’s not logging. 3.	O2 Sensor light comes on every time I go down my parking garage and stays on for the remainder of the trip. Dealership has no idea what to do. 4.	Key fob lasted 2 years. 300 Bucks+ for a new one, excluding programming costs. 5.	Gas mileage nowhere near estimated. A daily commuter who uses the interstate. I’m not heavy on the gas, I estimate 20.5 mpg with 91-octane.6.	Brand new $39,000. For a 2014 BMW X1, NADA Resale max shows $19,500. At best I lost $19,500 in three years.7.	I will never own another BMW.  I’ll stick with Lexus and Acura."
car_218,car 1,Handy as a pocket on a shirt.
car_219,A Great Sporty SUV!,"Drives like a nice little SUV sports car. I would recommend the xdrive over the sdrive, the xDrive has a much better drive feel."

car_221,Great handling vehicle with in need of improvement,"Purchased 2014 X1 fully loaded with M-Sport package. Great handling car with aggressive sporty ride, coming from a V6 engine it was hard to believe this car was only equipped with turbo 4. Comes with just enough tech to be comfortable (I never cared for Lane Departure Assistance, Front Collision Warning, and other new safety features). It however came with the crappiest quality materials I have seen in German cars, and it because the hard plastics were constantly expanding and rubbing, rattles/creaks were always present. The run flats combined with M suspension did not help either. Oh, and I purchased this vehicle at 45k and 2 years later the value was at 14k so its two year depreciation was @ 68% which is a little steep even for a BMW."
car_222,A BMW 3 Series as a small SUV,The great handling and braking of a 3 series with the added visibilty and cargo space of an SUV.
car_223,Tak ada fun right out of my BMW,"My first BMW and I'm now caught in the Takata airbag mess. BMW felt it was safe enough for me to drive but not take in trade, ""they also have a stop sale on any affected models"". I contacted BMW and asked for and got a rental car. The dealer now has my BMW and at this point I have doubts about if and when I will ever see it again and I'm sure I will take a beating when I trade or sell it if and when I do.  Do yourself a favor go to safercar.gov and check the vehicle ID number of ANY CAR you have or are looking to buy to check for open recalls!  Avoid any car with a TAKADA airbag open recall like the plague. On the bright side I have a rental 2016 VW Jetta 1.4 that is almost as peppy as my BMW, has a better quieter ride is way more roomy and it is getting between 36-38 MPG. (The BMW only got 23 MPG average) I could almost buy three VW's for what I paid for my X1 BMW . NEVER AGAIN LESSON LEARNED.. Foot Note: Several manufacturers are still making cars with these deadly inflators buyer beware!!!!!UPDATE Traded in 2016 for a new RAV 4 Hi-Bred the Rav rides better, burns regular gas, gets outstanding mileage, and the resale will be higher. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BMW lesson learned."
car_224,perfect crossover,"Drives very nimbly. Steering is easy on arthritic hands; in fact, that was one of the reasons we replaced a perfect 330xi. The only complaint I have is that the trunk release is near the hood release and not easily reachable. Still love the car."
car_225,30days and 3000 miles,"This is a great lil X1 and at a great price point for a 2014 used BMW.  I downsized from my 2005 X5 which I loved and miss very much (had 160k miles and never a major repair or problem).  I've always been happy with BMW's.  I've owned 7, 5, 3 and X series throughout the last 20 or so years.  The reason I down sized is because I'm a commuter and was looking for something that can give me 30mpg on the hwy.  It was the BMW or Subaru.  I've also enjoyed Subaru's and nowadays these are my only two choices of go to vehicles for cars as a daily driver.  I'm a car enthusiast and have owned Ferrari, Mercedes, Lexus and plenty other luxury and sports cars.  I'm not posting to brag I'm posting so the reader knows I have choices and know about many cars from first hand driving experience.  This X1 is great in handling around town.  I got this due to it's looks, compact size for ease of downtown parking, cargo area for placing travel bags, groceries and 60/40 split that I can slide in my surfboard.  The only reason I didn't choose the Subaru is I really don't visit the snow that much.  But if you get the X1 in the xDrive it'll be a very close match.  I got the sDrive because it feels more like driving a sports car with that real wheel power and cutting in tight corners when I punch it around the twisties and I like that feeling.  Go for the Ultimate Package as it'll include many features like Navigation, Rear Camera and Parking Distance Control.What I miss is having that extra space or elbow room when I have passengers and sitting much higher up (comparing with my old X5).  What I love better is the newer electronics and fuel efficiency and having the Ultimate Package amenities. If you're looking into a used X1 then go with 2014 or 2015 model years.  2013 was the first year this model hit the US and the 2016 has been completely redesigned in and out.  The deals are on the 2014 for all the lease returns that hit and chances are you'll still get the 4 year/50k miles free maintenance plan that's remaining and Certified Pre-Owned near bumper to bumper warranty if you buy it from a BMW dealer.  All the BMW dealerships I checked out actually had better deals compared to other car lots."
car_226,A (very) entry BMW....,"Base model X1, 2.8xDrive (very basic interior)+ sporty feel and drive+ great handling and feel on windy roads and highway- tight feel up front for 6ft male-very tight leg room for adult, tight leg room for 10 y/o  male behind 6ft driver- Unless low price is most important or harsh, but sporty drive is wanted, strongly consider 2016 model. Traded in for base model Acura RDX 2016, and after 6 months, very happy with the Acura. Albert[HTML removed]"
car_227,Should NOT have the BMW badge,"I have the 2014 xDrive28i model.  The seats are cheap and not comfortable for a long drive.  The acceleration is more like a Ford Escort than a BMW.  The sales guy said it is because it is a 4 cylinder.  No excuse.  The BMW engineers should be ashamed of what they created.  The navigation is ok, but feels more like my 2004 Infiniti G35 than a 2014.  The steering and suspension are stiff.  This is good for me.  It's very loud on the road.  You hear everything.  The tires wear down very quickly.  The dealer was telling me to replace them at around 13,000 miles.  Ridiculous.  Anyone, besides my kids, who gets into the car has a little trouble, no matter how I position the passenger seat. I've taken the car to the dealer a dozen times over the past 2 years for different problems (wiper blades not contacting windshield, bluetooth wouldn't connect, valve cover leaking oil onto intake manifold, and the list goes on).  Thankfully, I only have one year left on my lease.  It kills me to have to drive this car for that long, but it's the commitment/mistake I made.  I feel like I got taken by the BMW logo.  Won't happen again."
car_228,Great compact SUV (hatchback),"I purchased a new Acura RDX and traded it after 6 months for an X1. I missed the BMW driving dynamics and this car delivers! The steering is meant to be heavy and an engaging drive. Those who want softer should look to Acura or Lexus. The X1 is not as luxurious as the 3 or 5 series but the price tag makes up for it. I have the Premium and Tech packages, it has everything I wanted in features. Love the handling and hatchback style. So happy to be back in a BMW!"
car_229,Great little SUV,"I have a 328i convertble as well as the X1. The X1 handles as good as my 328i. Fun to drive, easy entry front and back seats, and quick when needed.  Great car."
car_230,'Disappointment' is the best compliment this car gets,"I have owned five BMW's now including a 2001 3 series convertible, a 2003 3 series, a 2009 Z4 and now the X1.  I intentionally dropped down in size and class of car, so I went in expecting some compromises..but not what I have gotten.  Horribly cramped, the auto engine cut off is terrible, average gas mileage is 7-8 mpg worse than the lowest rating, interior is flimsy and several plastic pieces fall out of their place regularly and worst of all, my side airbags went of with no collision at all as I was taking a corner (BMW dealer has told me this isn't the first time they have dealt with this!)  Add to this the fact that the seats are horribly uncomfortable and I am beyond disappointed."
car_231,Continually Amazed by BMW,"I have owned/driven the whole range of BMW - 3 series, 5, X6, 650, M3, etc.  This car has the same DNA.  I wanted something small and simple for work, baseball coaching, skiing, winter/summer.  I looked at Subaru Outback.  The outback was $13K less based on MSRP but the X1 leased for $150 less per ($330 per month with nothing down but an old Escape with 130K miles).  The little engine is just amazing even comparing to all the big BMW V8s.  I dont need more than 240 hp.  When BMW beats subaru on price+features, I'd call that value!"
car_232,Just got one.,"I can't say much about it, I got it for wife who said she wanted a hatchback with pep.  These criteria took me to the VW GTI, a very highly rated and affordable car.  We test drove one of those, and wife found it too low, and plain looking.  She somehow decided it was a ""kid car"".
I was frustrated and so surfed to the X1.
Wife loved it's classy look (the BMW emblem on it didn't hurt anything), it's higher stance, and was very happy driving it.  It's amazingly affordable.
Her's has the moonroof and the nice rain-sensing wipers. Most other features are standard.
We picked out one of 3 white ones on the lot, I would have liked the premium audio and upgraded rearview with compass"
car_233,Big Disappointment,"After 2 new Cadillacs and making the change to BMW in May, I have been very disappointed. First off when I drove the brakes had to be replaced with less than 1000 miles.The On/Off functionality is stupid.When you park the car it shuts off except for the accessories and you have to turn it on and then off again which causes wear and tear per the manual.And after 4 months apparently there was liquid spilled on the iDrive which caused it to be replaced for the cost of $650.Unbelievable design to put an electronic iDrive between 2 cup holders that can't withstand condensation from a cup.Cheap interior as well.Never Again!"
car_234,A BMW from the good old days of BMW design,"I bought this X1 because it's a dying breed of BMW from times before BMW went soft, heavy, and lost their steering mojo. It has the chassis and handling dynamics from the previous generation E90/E91 platform that's one of the best handling 3 series. It has hydraulic steering instead of BMW's new vague, imprecise electric steering. Those are combined with the most recent, excellent drive train. Add the comparatively low price and this BMW is unique. It will be replaced in the 2016 model year by a front-wheel drive platform shared with the Mini Cooper. Yuck."
car_235,from 325i to X1,"I traded in my old (and long out of warranty 2005 325i) for new X1 with premium package.Note: I got it cheaper than edmunds suggested price, so use it as trading starting pointSo far I have 400 miles only and will try to update it later. But for now I am very biased and I like this car. I like driving and this one just pure joy. However my old 325i could turn sharper (X1 center of gravity is higher). Also turbo does not respond as fast as my previous car's 6cil from dead stop. There is a short delay and then turbo delivers massive torque and then traction control has to work hard ;)On the hiway its pure joy, power is always there when you need it. At 400 mi I got 26+ mpg, no eco-pro"
car_236,"Not For Everyone, But Great Car For Me","Drives like a sports sedan but relatively roomy in terms of headroom and (to a lesser degree) elbow room.I'm a bigger guy (6'1"" and about 240), and I bought this as a compromise between the 3 series, which I felt was a little more low-slung than I like, and the X3, which felt relatively boat-like.Bonus: not only do I prefer the X1 to those two vehicles, but it is about $10K cheaper when similarly equipped."
car_237,Much Better than Expected,"I was a bit concerned about the 4 cylinder engine but boy does it still provide a lot of pep.Lots of grip. Feels like I am driving an expensive sports sedan. Has the same confident, lane-holding feel when you are zipping down the far left lane on the highway like you feel in an X5.Lots of room in the front, though not much for storage.There are only 2 safety belts in the rear though there is room for a 3rd person in the middle.Because of the 40/20/40 split, there is a lot of storage flexibility.The fuel economy is nice too.I bought mine as a service loaner w 4K miles and WHAT A VALUE at around $31K.I am as satisfied with this vehicle as with any vehicle previously owned."
car_238,EDP X1,"Ordered car and picked up in Munich as an EDP car in June.Major options:M Package, Winter Package.Nice firm ride and soaks up bumps well.Drove car 2,850 miles in Germany, Austria, and France.Top speed driven was 125 mph on the Autobahn -- car was feeling floaty so did not go faster although the engine could handle it.No issues in Europe over 2,850 miles.Averaged 25 to 28 mpg.Back in Calif., I have driven 2,200 miles and averaged from 25 to 27 mpg since being back.I attribute the same MPG while driving much slower to the lower fuel quality (ethanol)"
car_239,Love my little X4,"I don't have a large family to haul around, size works fine for me. I like the smaller engine for economy and I can always change to Sport Mode if I have a need for speed, but seriously the pick up is absolutely fine.  The front seats are very comfortable and cabin is VERY quiet. Steering is nice and tight, my previous X3 was not. I have owned the X1 ( seats were too short ), X3 nice but a bit boring on looks and sloppy steering. For those of us who love but cannot afford the X6, give this a test drive ."
car_240,"Wow, Very Impressed","As a previous BMW owner (3 series X-drive diesel), I was familiar with the brand but wanted to get something that had a different style to it...thus I went with the X4 and boy I wasn't disappointed.  Yes, I've read the reviews of not alot of cargo space compared to the X3 and reduced visibility because of the way the rear end is sloped but so far neither of those items are concerns for me.  Cargo area is fine for grocery & mall shopping; it's not like I'm purchasing a 50 flat screen tv everyday.  Rear visibility is good; just use your mirrors.  But I did add the Driver Assist Plus package which gives me a bit more confidence in driving.  BMW's X-drive is very nice as it controls power to all 4 wheels and keeps the vehicle stable and in control during rain, snow, and icy conditions.  Overall I'm very happy with my lease and when it's time to make another choice, I'll be hard pressed to go back to a sedan or get another X4."
car_241,Test drove the Macan S and M40i,"Before you buy this car test drive the Porsche Macan S and you will soon see that while the Macan might be better looking, the Bmw clearly has quicker  acceleration and a much lighter sports car feel.  The Macan felt heavy and sluggish.  On top of that an exhaust note similar to the M4.  This car is real fun to drive and it will blow off most SUV's/cars on the road and when your screaming by them with this exhaust backfire they look at you like what the .... was that?"
car_242,X4 M40i,This vehicle is magnificent. The design with the sloped roof is striking and turns many heads as folks try to figure out just what it is. Absolutely great lines with an aggressive look backed up by a powerful engine. Love it!
car_243,X4 M40i Size-wise-good-stuff,It is very rare and people will buy it out from under you if you hesitate. Drive it and love it.
car_244,a hot mess of annoying little issues,"As a huge fan of BMWs and somebody who currently owns 3 BMW's, I hate the X3.  It's under powered, and the transmission can be cluncky at the worst possible times.  (as you wait for it to find the right gear while your hanging out in the left lane trying to pass, with all the horsepower of a lawnmower).  On top of all this, my bigger 2006 V8 convertible gets better gas mileage.  WTF?The seats are rock hard and everything (I mean EVERYTHING) is a cheap plastic.  I have so many squeaks and rattles, it's kinda amazing.  Seats squeak, the panoramic sunroof squeaks and the rear hatch makes a noise.  Then, on top of all this, you have to do everything TWICE.  Open the car?  Pull the leaver twice.  Turn off the car, twice (one to shut off engine, second to shut off power).  Adjust the temp?  Well, for that you got 3 manual adjustments.  Sure, you can use the ""auto"" feature, but then you have manual fan speed you have to adjust and the manual temp adjustment for the center vents????? What a huge disappointment, I will never buy a newer BMW again.  Stick to BMW pre 2008 and you'll be just find.  Avoid these never models, they aren't worth it.  Seriously, what was i thinking buying this thing?"
car_245,2012 X3 M Fully Loaded WOW WOW WOW!,"We are having an addition to the family so it was time to upgrade from the Mini Cooper. Baby number 3 is on the way.I have always wanted the X5 the one that seats 7. When it came out in 2007 I waited and waited so that I could buy a fully loaded used one. The one I wanted brand new was 90,000.00 but I was 22 and there was just no way at that age. Im 28 now, and baby number 3 on the way I went to my usual BMW dealership and saw the fully loaded X3 M. I thought. What the heck Ill just drive it and pretend I can have it. Its been a month and a half and I LOVE IT. I cant take corners in it like the mini but it will do. (I kept the mini anyway) Its luxury."
car_246,Great Choice,"I'll preface my review in that this is my 3rd BMW. Each time I've gone to find a car, I have done an exhaustive analysis with spreadsheets multiple test drives and comparison figures recorded. Let's face it, cars aren't cheap and we should be happy with our choice after the deal is done and we drive off the lot. On each search, while the BMW wasn't the winner for all of the categories it had the best combination of features/performance and price that I was looking for. My advise, order one, and you can still work your dealers over and you can get a much better price -- even as good as one already built.Also work them on financing and get the deal you want you'll enjoy the final x3."
car_247,Love the car but...,This is our first 2012 BMW X3 35i M Sports Package. My husband and I love the car but it drifts right. Even on a flat road the car will veer to the right if you let go of the steering wheel. The dealership had it for a week and came back and said that this was normal for the X3's. Does anyone else's X3 drift to the right? It's very noticeable at high speeds but you can still notice it at lower speeds.
car_248,It can't get any better than this.,This is my 7th BMW and I couldn't be happier.Looks stunning.Drives like a sports car.Comfortable sports seats that hugs you.It's been 300 miles and I'm still getting use to the fun.I had the older X3 and this is night and day.The old x3 drived like a truck and was not comfortable at all.The 2012 model is extremely smooth with its 7 gears.
car_249,the most fun to drive suv,"so far 3000 miles of fun driving, no problems, excellent comfort and quality all around, my 5th bmw, great power"
car_250,"Two weeks, four days old and in shop 17 days",Production problems have bedeviled my 2012 X3.Continual drive train error messages/check engine light faults.I have driven a total of maybe 20 miles.It has sat in my dealers service area for 17 days out of the 18 I have owned it.My 5th BMW and quite possibly my last.I traded in a Q5 for this; what a mistake.
car_251,Out With The Old..In With The New,"We have had our X1 2017 for 8 months. Positive comments include terrific pick up, unencumbered interior, a nice tight turning radius, huge panoramic moon roof, bold styling ,outstanding heater/air conditioning and a good value for a new Beemer. As well, if living in a colder climate, DO spring for the heated front seats and steering wheel. They are worth every penny. Lastly, in 2017 many options were stand alone so the cost was individualized, not part of a more expensive package.Needed improvements include 1.MUCH more comfortable front seats. Our options included sport seats after reading the consumer reviews, which were right on. Even the sport seats are narrow and too firm. We have had 5 other Beemers and never had an issue with the seat comfort. 2. Considerable road noise. We have 19"" upgraded tires[run flat] and they might contribute to the level of noise. 3. BE CAREFUL!! The 'sliding rear seat' option does provide for more cargo room but since the regular position of the rear seat almost abuts the rear wheel well, you only gain about an inch of additional rear legroom by paying for this option. It's simply not worth it unless additional cargo room is a priority. I am 6' 3"" and need to move the front seat all the way back, leaving a tight area for legroom behind my driver's seat. BMW did cheapen their warranty so be advised that items covered in the past now cost the consumer[e.g. windshield wipers replacement on warranty] The length of the warranty has been modified as well. As for the title of this review, we did have an older version of the X1 and loved it....until a texting individual decided to join us in the back seat, totaling the car we had for only 6 months. For what it's worth, it took the rear and frontal impact very well and there were only a couple of broken ribs and lacerations. Her speed was at least 50 mph on impact."
car_252,Amazing experience,I absolutely love this car.
car_253,"2017 X1, My 13th BMW","This is a small SUV, but it holds me very well, 6'3 255lbs. This small version of an SUV has an comfortable ride, a little stiff for some, but not for BMWers. It handles very very well. Superior acceleration for a 4cyl engine. Good visibility all the way around.This X1 is fully loaded, but a blind spot monitor was not available at any cost. It must be the only BMW without that option. Why? I think the BSP is a great option, it has saved me a couple of times from cutting somebody off or even an accident that would have been my fault. My wife drives the car mostly, and she loves it. Small enough so that she can park and maneuver around things fairly easily, but large enough to feel like you have some metal between you and the other idiots who drive so nutsy on our local roads. I find the interior of the X1 a little inferior in quality materials from other BMW's, still good stuff, but somehow it seems a little weak for a BMW. The technology and especially the layout of the interior is the best there is, anywhere. We test drove the Audi Q3, Lexus NX, BMW was a clear winner over these two comparable models. I would give this BMW 4.5 stars if not for the lacking BSP. It only gets 4 as is. My 2006 M3 convertible soft top is still my favorite, it gets a 5 along with my Porsche Macan S, the only two cars I have ever given a 5 rating to, and I have owned LOTS of high end cars and SUV's. Cheers..............."
car_254,So far so good,I have had this car for a month.  I am still not used to the quieting of the motor at stops and then kicking in when accelerating.  Storage console is very small and I like to have things at hand.  Where do I store my CDs?  Compartment not big enough for this.  Hairbrush doesn't fit.  Turn signal is also something I am slow to get used to.  The car is just the right size for me and so far so good.
car_255,X1 the smaller choice,Great BMW on the smaller scale . Only complaint  would be  outside air noise a bit loud at higher speeds maybe this is from the full Sunroof and shoulder room in front seats . A little wider would be a great idea for next model.
car_256,2017 X1 a Different Car From the 2015 X1,"We had a leased 2015 X1 whose lease was up and opted to go inot a 2017 X1.  Our '15 was 12K miles over the agreement and BMW let us out of the lease early and forgave the extra miles, so it was the best path.  The '17 X1 is a different car then the '15 model year.  The seats are smaller/shorter and are not as comfortable for me, a 5'10"", 150# male, but for my wife, a petite 5'1"" 110# female they are great.  She likes the seating position more than the '15 X1.  IMO, the interior is cheaper than before.  For example, the shifter is a simpler analog type vs. the electric fly by wire on the '15 model.  The buttons and switches, while still of high quality are noticeably different in feel.  Our model has the iDrive knob/buttons in the center console, no nav, and is OK, but a distraction, IMO.  To the positive, the turbo charged engine has plenty of power, and brakes are good.  I really like the LED headlights, they put out a nice bright white light.  The cabin noise is about the same as the '15, and is I believe, affected by the OEM tires used by the factory.  Overall, BMW says this is the lowest cost Bimmer, and on this count they are right, they accomplish this feat by using cheaper components.  We have been a BMW family for 15+ years owning 7s, Z3, Z4, 535i, X3 (still owned and going strong with 118K on the odometer) and 2 X1s, so I am a bit conflicted that they are producing such entry level cars.  It is becoming harder to rationalize BMWs cost premium for this class when there are so many other competitive SUVs on the market."
car_257,Great vehicle,Amazing handling. Very sporty.
car_258,Test drove only a short distance,"Really enjoyed the handling, interior was nice and the cargo carrying ability was good. Uses premium gas which I don't care for however most of the nicer rigs use it to help up the performance."
car_259,Finally bought a BMW after looking for 15 years,"The 2017 X1 S is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I bought it to replace my 2015 Ford Escape which itself is a great compact SUV. I saw a 2015 X1 and thought I'd give it a look. My impression was cheaply made, way too small, and WAY overpriced. I ended up replacing my 2013 Ford Escape with a 2015 Ford Escape (long story, but I got a killer deal on the car and the trade-in and 0% financing so it made financial sense). We recently ordered my wife a 2017 Mini Countryman S version (a fantastic car btw) and during my research found the new Countryman was based on the NEW X1, so I gave it a look. I am so glad I did. A totally different car from the previous version. Plenty of interior room, nice materials, great ride, and for the first time in my life, a great value on a BMW. I don't like the feel of the sport seats--they just are very uncomfortable for me. But the standard seats are surprisingly comfortable, which ultimately sold me on the car.  I love the ability to use the eco mode when driving on the longer stretches of road. I have been getting 32 mpg on my normal commute. And when I shift to the sport mode, there is plenty of fun power when I want it. Its not a sedan or coupe, its a compact SUV, but it is fun to drive. A few little complaints, like the fact that the cup holders hold maybe a sippee cup and  there is no digital speedometer or compass on the base model, the Bluetooth seems to lag a little when using Waze or Google maps, and the A/C seems to want to run even when I turn it off.  But all-in-all a great car."
car_260,Great SUV,"Love this car, did lot of research and decided to order this car. The reason I ordered the car is because of the color and i wanted the sport package that has the sports seats. I did not like the regular seats at all, and my advise to all is that for 2017 you can order the car with sports seats, i would have not bought this car otherwise. I got this car loaded except for the driver assistance package with is worthless in NYC.  I only have a couple of minor gripes about this gorgeous car. The first one that when i picked up the car at the performance center i found out that the media system does not have a hard drive and my second grype is that the car does not a a space for sunglasses, so I use the cubby hole in the drivers side door. This car looks luxurious and great with the sport package big difference over the regular one. it is worth the extra money for the looks and suspension. One more thing I would love to see this car with a bigger engine and a diesel option."
car_261,AVOID THE X1!,"I recently got into a 2017 X1 and it was a huge mistake. After test driving the car a few times I decided to transition from my 328i into an X1 as I was looking for more space and comfort. After driving off the lot and sitting in the car for 15 minutes I immediately noticed the seat was off. THESE ARE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEATS. The driver's seat is now causing me BACK PAIN which I've had to visit a chiropractor to help manage. Unfortunately, both the dealer and BMW corporate have not been helpful - they claim there's nothing they can do to help me. I unfortunately will have to to exit my lease early and get into another make and model."
car_262,X1  not a BMW,Take car out for a day drive.
car_263,First BMW,"We shopped around for quite some time looking for a small/midsize crossover. We test drove literally dozens of vehicles: Mazda, Audi, Benz, Honda, Ford, to name a few. We were between the Volvo XC 60 and the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. We loved the Volvo but the price at $52K out the door was a little more than we were willing to pay. We were about to settle on the Hyundai (even though it didn't drive especially well) when the night before I read an article about the X1 and figured we'll go check it out before settling on the Hyundai. To our delight, we loved the way the X1 looked, drove, and its interior is bigger than it seems from the outside. The trunk was the biggest surprise to us with the underneath compartment. We loved the car. We compromised on the base X-Drive model MSRP of $36K but got them down to $33K. We took it home that night and have been enjoying it ever since. Nearly 1 month later, we have gotten a good feel for the X1. Our biggest complaints have to do with some basic features lacking in the base model which we knew going in. The fully loaded Hyundai had all the features I'm talking about i.e. LED Headlights, XM Radio, Blind Spot monitoring, Sunroof, backup camera, adaptive cruise, forward collision warning, integrated sunshades, heated seats, navigation to name some big ones. The X1 does have some of these features if you elect certain packages but the price will quickly climb into the 40's and beyond. Ultimately, we chose the BMW because it drove 100 times better than the Hyundai and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress up a Hyundai it is still a Hyundai and drives as such. We've been averaging 25MPG combined which is better than all the other vehicles we tried especially with an all-wheel drive. Besides our lack of options our only other complaint really is the suspension. As expert reviewers have stated, the X1's suspension is very stiff and you feel it when you go over speed bumps or bumps in the road. But I still prefer the stiffness over the squishyness of the Hyundai's body roll suspension. Another weird thing our X1 lacks is the ability to control the rear dome light from the rear. It's an odd design flaw but we'll get over it. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our decision."
car_264,Bigger than it looks Driving Dynamics Control with,"I recently purchased a 2017 BMW X1 Xdrive.  I have previously owned (2) 3 series and (1) 5 series.  IMO, the 2017 X1 is the best value for the money of all the other BMW's I have owned.  It is not the best handling or planted to the road BMW I've owned, actually it is the least.  But, for its class, its absolutely the best handling and value for money.  For this class(small CUV), I actually prefer the front drive platform to give it the best overall use of space.  This little CUV(I consider it a cuv instead of SUV), because its actually more like a slightly raised hatchback or wagon but looks like a SUV.  The 2017 is slightly revised from the complete remodel in 2016.  The 2016 has a standard sport suspension but for 2017 they changed suspensions and made the sport or M suspension available as an option with the M sport package only.  I assumed I would like the 2016 better but after test driving the 2016 and 2017 models, I actually preferred the 2017 suspension better.  IMO, the 2016 is a little harsh and hard. I think the 2016 having a sport suspension and awd the handling is amazing but a little hard for many people interested in a suv. The 2017 has a more comfortable feeling but still offers terrific handling, especially for its class.  I really enjoy the std ""Driving Dynamics control"" with Eco, comfort and sport settings.  In sport it changes the heft and feel of the steering and even though it probably doesn't effect the suspension, some how it does effect the over all feeling of the handling and seems to improve it.  I drive all the time in sport setting.  I have not driven the FWD only model but I am pretty sure the AWD model provides better handling and a more planted feeling.  For those of you that don't want to purchase the M sports package that includes sport suspension, the standard suspension with sport setting and awd still offers great handling in the 2017.  This car zips around and goes into tight spots pretty easy.  Its actually a small car but feels very big inside and that's because of the front wheel drive platform it offers a much better use of space.  The back seats offer plenty room.  The cargo space in back is plenty big and also there is space underneath the floor on the back that provides even more storage. There is also plenty of head room in the X1.  The quality of the plastics are good, typical Teutonic German simple look but a luxury look and feel to dash.  The std front seat probably needs a little more cushion but the standard vinyl seats look good.  If you are looking for a small suv(cuv) I think the BMW x1 is clearly the best in its class."
car_265,X1 is it a BMW?,"I traded a 2014 X1 for a 2017.... I saw it, it looks great! a big improvement, I got inside.. great, another big improvement across the board, really an aggressive/beautiful car inside and out.... then I drove it? wait a minuet, did I get in a BMW or Mercedes? a little less power than my 2014, noticeable in particular when accelerating while moving, such as passing, but even worse the shifting,... gone is the precision, satisfying, almost manual like shifts exactly where they should be in every situation, now shifting feels like standard Mercedes in eco mode, or other quality but soft car. I buy BMW partly due to driving experience, BMW missed a great opportunity to show us a front drive could feel like a BMW, this does not, don´t get me wrong it is a great car, my wife likes it better, says it is more comfortable, and it is, but seat of the pants does not feel as good, it just does not feel 100% BMW due mostly to transmission personality."
car_266,agree to disagree,"previous owner of earlier bmw's, mini cooper S', porsche and ferrari, as well as a slew of others, I am compelled to disagree with earlier gentleman' statement about harsher ride, this X-1 we bought precisely because as a small cross-over this rides impeccably well, so much more than we ever anticipated, which is why we bought it! Keep it out of sport mode!  Or not I use it for performance purposes, my spouse does not, the choice is ours to make. We looked at four door clubman, f-pace jags, MB slams & c's, none do what this car does especially for the price, none!"
car_267,sexy and complicated,confusing controls --- complicated!  not much visibility at the back
car_268,Completely different car from earlier X1's,"My wife and I test-drove a 2017 X1 last week. Happily, we also test-drove an X3, which, in our opinion, made the X1 look terrible. She ended up buying a new X3, which she finds, at this point, to be a wonderful car. Anyway, I own a 2013 X1, which I like very much. I have nothing but good to say about it. But the 2017 we drove  was definitely a different car from mine. It looks pretty much the same, although I think it is a little larger. The turbo-four still has the nice kick to it. But the ride was hard -- bumpy and uncomfortable compared to my 2013 and especially compared to the X3 we drove. So, if you are interested in an X1, keep in mind that you are considering a car so different from the older X1's that perhaps it should have been renamed."
car_269,Very Happy,I bought this car with 77K on the clock. now at 86. I could not be happier; handles like a Porsche 911.
car_270,Disappointed in BMW Engineering,"i have had my 2008 X3 for 5 years now and very disappointed in BMW Engineering, very poor engineering and i had to do repairs frequently, cannot count but the recent one was starter and ipbs switch that costed me $1100."
car_271,"Good for first 50,000 miles","BMW should really be embarrassed about the long term reliability these little guys have.  Someone said it right, they are BMWs (Big Maintenance Waste).  At 90,000 miles, the X drive system with the incredibly cheaply made plastic gear (transfer case actuator - google it) went out, both vanos units went out, shifts hard and lunges on inclines, there was about $4,000 of other stuff that I can't even remember the details of and the thing requires 93 octane.  Pros:  It does stop great for an SUV.  It is heavy and feels substantial.  I think it would be good in a wreck.  My suggestion: buy most any American made small SUV.  While not as nice and lacking the two bar emblem, they are more reliable and present less worries about what problems are going to surface when I crank up today.   Any Japanese small SUV is more reliable and better made.  These American and Japanese models also use the cheapest rot gut gas you can find and you simply hammer down to get from point a to b.  BMWs must be babied and the initial cost is truly only the beginning of the heavy cost you will get to experience with an X3."
car_272,BMW 2008 X3,This has been a great car!  Minimal issues over the 8 years.
car_273,Love my X3!,"I am the second owner of my X3...it is a local car purchased at the BMW dealership and had been serviced there.  It now has 95,000 miles on it and I plan to keep for a long time.  I have learned that it runs much smoother on 93 octane Shell gasoline.  The only issue I have is the tire pressure light is on and numerous people have tried to make it go away with no success...BMW dealership does not recommend spending the money it would cost to clear it.  My husband is 6'2"" and he does have difficulty getting in the car but finds it roomy enough once he is in!"
car_274,Never Again,"I just got my 2008 BMW X3 a few months ago back in April. I bought it off a used lot and as I drove away, the engine light came on. I've taken it in multiple times and I've had everything from my radio just suddenly not wanting to work to my car cutting off in the middle of a busy intersection. This car has almost gotten me in many accidents with its poor driving performance. I actually had it in the shop for a week during Thanksgiving and as soon as I got it back it broke down and left me stranded the day after. I got it back to the repair place and it magically had 10+ new issues. We have spent well over 3k in the past few weeks on this vehicle. I would absolutely never suggest this car to anyone especially as their first car unless you want to constantly have your car in the shop and 0 money in  your wallet. I will never purchase a BMW ever again. They say to get rid of a BMW once it hits 85,000 miles... I should have listened.Oh, and not to mention its HORRIBLE gas mileage. I fill up every week and it costs around 50 bucks every time. It's ridiculous."
car_275,Still One of The Funniest Cars I've Owned,"Purchased my pre-owned 2008 BMW E83/X3 coming off of a lease with 32,000 miles on the clock.  Lucky enough to find a rare 6 speed manual, which sold me from the get go and unfortunately the dealership knew as in their words ""we have 2 other people with cash in hand willing to buy the car sight unseen"", and I believed them, but still got a fair deal.  So far I haven't any electronic or sun roof issues which I understand come with the territory.  Obviously can't speak to the automatic shifting complaints that are out there but I can say the 6 speed manual shifts like butter.  In summary, the 2008 X3 is roomy enough for the family and fun enough for Dad to drive.  The interior is appealing to the eye and logically laid out.  My only complaint is that they stopped offering the 6 speed option after 2010 or I would have bought new.Update: one year since this review and I haven't had a single issue with this car, still lovin it, can't wait to tackle the coming Winter!"
car_276,Great SAV /Sports car,"I'll tell ya, I've had a bunch of SUV Japanese vehicles and none compare to the X3. Love the power and handling. I have not had it in snow yet but looking forward to taking to the mountains this winter, it's a tight suspension and I like it. Bluetooth works but not as easy to set up as other vehicles. Really like the interior but most of all the power and steering are aesome, I have the xenon light pkg  wow! I love the adaptive lights!"
car_277,"BMW, never again","I have owned 5 BMW's over the last 30 years, 2 were good cars 3 were not, the current 2008 X3 is the worst of the lot. body water leaks, engine oil leaks, sensor failures, water pump failure, ignition coil failures, transmission failure, you name it and I have had to have it fixed all before the car reached 91000 miles. I purched the car from BMW as a certified used car and had trouble with it from the beginning. The Dealer was of little help they just kept telling me the transmission was fine UNTIL the extended warrenty ran out, then it was "" It failed and you need to replace it "" at a cost of 8 grand. BMW is not the Ultimate Driving Machine, they are the Ultimate Maintenance Machine"
car_278,let down,"I knew what we were getting into with the car when purchased back in 2012, with 58k miles on it. But I was assured that BMWs last forever.  Wasn't a full month and the car was in the shop. Spent hundreds on the vanos, which I later learned is German for ""don't let your local non certified BMW mechanic work on your cat or you will spend hundreds of dollars repairs the vanos"".   Gas guzzling vehicle, but just never captured any value from the car. Just a big let down from day one.  Oh and a bright orange light in the car was annoying as was the fact I could never pair the Bluetooth despite 3 ""know how to do it"" guys trying."
car_279,Would Recommend 2008 BMW X3,"I bought this SUV a year ago and I'm extremely pleased.  Needs just regular maintenance as far as oil changes, etc.  No problems whatsoever.  Drives great and I feel very safe in this vehicle, especially in snow.  Very sturdy and I live in Pittsburgh so we get a fair amount of bad weather.

I've had 3 Audi's and a Volvo; this is my first BMW.  I really do love the X3.  I can't drive a big SUV.  I'm 5'0"" and this is the perfect size.  Not too small, but not too big.

Note:  I have the 3.0xi automatic, not the 6-speed manual but it did not provide that option."
car_280,Never again,"First and last BMW.   Quality is not what you would expect from a high end vehicle.  Problems started almost immediately, the warranty covered the repairs not the in convince of the wasted time.  After warranty ran out.. 55k miles...replaced window regulator on passenger window, at 60k miles, replaced all 6 sparks plugs. at 65 k, replaced valve cover gasket. at 67K, replaced water pump.  Now at 68k, all 4 engine mount bolts have sheared..vibration broke the water pump.  Never again.. Disappointed in BMW's responses."
car_281,Sheared Motor Mount Bolts,"2008 BMW X3 with 59,000 miles sheared all 4 motor mount bolts in normal street driving.BMW said Â“tough luckÂ”.A quick internet search indicated this was not an isolated incident, many other relatively low mileage BMW's have had sheared motor mount bolts.I believe this problem to be a serious safety issue and filed a complaint with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.I encourage others that have had similar problems to file NHTSA complaints at the following website:safercar.govClick the Â“REPORT A VEHICLE OR CHILD SEAT DEFECTÂ” Tab and submit your complaint.If there are enough complaints, BMW will, hopefully, be forced to acknowledge this problem."
car_282,I'm very much disappointed,"I've just finished the 4 year warranty with my car as of September 1st 2012. The car was at the dealer several times, the gas odometerdoesn't show the actual gas in the tank even the tank is full until several days later. It doeslet me pump gas into it and keep stop getting gas even the tank is not half yet. The water pump was not working just 2 year for a brand new X3. The dealer had to replace a new pump because the engine shut off while I was driving several times due to no coolant water in the engine. Now the warranty is over just 22 days, the car is just 28k and the coolant water pump having the problem again.I'm very disappointed and regret that I bought this expensive car."
car_283,BRAKES FAILED,"My X3 brakes failed causing a major accident.The accident resulted in approximately $75,000 worth of damage.BMW denied any brake issues.When I picked the vehicle up from BMW body shop I had to return it.All of the brake indicator lights on the dashboard lit up. I loved how my vehicle handled, but there were frequent trips to the repair shop, including previous brake jobs.It was disturbing and disappointing that BMW denied a major issue that could have resulted in casualties.BMW blamed the car mats for the accident (sounds familiar).Yet they returned the vehicle with mats in same position.Car was in service 2 wks before accident.A co-worker friend had similiar experience."
car_284,2008 X3: Problem Prone,"I've owned BMWs for the last 10 years; I love the way they handle. Fortunately, my 2008 X3 is a lease.  At 5K a chronic, very loud engine tapping began (akin to the vehicle in the movie 'Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang.') I had it serviced at least 6 times. By 21K, the tapping reduced to a soft finger strumming, it still taps, but I deal with it.  The engine strains on small & big hills & fails to shift. The car has, on *multiple* occasions, locked me inside.  Neither the unlocking mechanism nor the windows opened. I drove to the dealer, called them on my cell, had them force the window down & climbed out.  The interior handles, cup holders, arm rests, etc. are peeling& have been replaced once."
car_285,Bucking bronco,"Unexpected acceleration when going over bumps or after turning uphill can throw you into car in front of you, complete hesitation on entrance ramp, strange gear changes. Totally unacceptable and un-ultimate driving experience. Turned the 2007 model in as a lemon because it was so dangerous. 2008 is only slightly better than 2007. No help from software patches at dealer service dept. Will"
car_286,Part 2 of N52 engine really has problems,"My review somehow incorrectly stated the miles on my X3. The engine valve issue started at 6K, Not 60K as it states. And the car only has 11K,Not 110K as the reviews states, and yes it has been in the shop 5 times in a year and a half. The followup to my last review: After being in the shop for the 5th time BMW thinks the valve slam/tapping is normal! you should hear this especially during a cold start...it sounds like crap, no kidding it slams and thumps like crazy, and this was AFTER the cylinder head replacement! the sound comes and goes still! BMW WILL NOT DO MUCH FOR YOU AFTER THESE ATTEMPTS TO FIX A DEFECTIVE ENGINE ACCEPT TELL YOU THAT THE SOUND IS NORMAL!! BE WARNED FUTURE BMW BUYERS"
car_287,N52 engine really has problems,"I purchased my x3 new, did my research and the x3 came in to be up there with the 3 series in quality.  At around 60k the valves started to tap like crazy, (metal on metal sounds- if yours is doing this it is not normal! It needs to be repaired- don't let the dealer service people tell you it's air bubbles in the oil. It will lead to premature engine failure this should be covered under warranty) the tapping sound was especially loud with cold starts. The engine cylinder head was replaced, but the sound is more of a thumping slamming sound now, it will be in the shop this week again! Even the BMW techs I've talked to, feel the quality of BMW is really slipping."
car_288,First and Last BMW,"Well German engineering aside this SUV has been the worst new car I have ever owned in 30 years of driving.  It lives at the dealer.  So far still cannot fix the hesitation issue which is severe in normal ""D""; moon roof significant issues: needed new exhaust at 40K miles: blower motor issues; navigation system is major piece of junk: now satellite radio is defective and no parts to fix it; X drive is lousy in the snow not really a true AWD system; etc.  Horrible vehicle trying to get out of the lease early.  When get loaner car usually a 3 series love it.  X3 is just a BMW fiasco stay far far away from any of these until they redesign it.  Oh love heating steering wheel."
car_289,Second X3 better than the first,"We leased a 2005 X3 and loved it so much, we leased a new 2008 when the first lease was up. I wanted to post this review because many people post because they have an axe to grind. Both X3's we owed were excellent. The 2008 has been completely perfect, no flaws or repairs in 22,000 miles. The new 3.0si engine that was put into X3 beginning in 2007 flat out rips with 260 HP. Handling is great, yes it is a little stiff but you are rewarded with a SUV with 50:50 weight distribution and very sporty handling. If you want a cushy floaty ride, numb steering, and 30 MPG, look elsewhere."
car_290,Solid for a challenging climate,"For me driving in major snow storms is a given.  This vehicle does everything you need it to do and feels rock solid.  I drove through a monster storm this morning and to a ski resort last week on poor road conditions. I was never concerned.It tracks the road, is very stable and in the worst storm is balanced and steady.   Unlike some larger SUVs I have had, the size and weight distribution on this vehicle provides a feel for the road surface and an ability to get you there.  This vehicle is for someone who wants a smaller suv that can get you around in the worst of conditions.  And of course, its a BMW so it goes without saying that the interior, the reliability and the extras are fantastic"
car_291,Really fun to drive,"I have owned my 2008 X3 for 1 year. The ride is great, handling is incredible. Brakes are superior. I have the winter package, it works well. Had a problem with the heating coils in the back seat, they stuck. Dealer did a great job fixing the problem. GPS and radio are cheap at best. Gas mileage average. AWD is great. Overall great car so far."
car_292,2008 bmw x3,"Driving Hondas for years (owned three and put over 200k miles on each of them). I recently purchased a new BMW X3 in September. Been a BMW motorcyclist for over 25 years. I thought I would try one of their four wheeled models. I have been a bit skeptical about the quality of BMW cars, ""they drive great, but more electrical demons than you can imagine"" and so on is what I would hear. The X3 drives great, it's a solid handler, great tracking, good road feel. But guess what: at 1243 miles my cd player-radio just decided to quite working, off to the shop it goes. It's a minor issue, but a radio should work on a brand new $43k car!!"
car_293,Great Crossover,"This is my 2nd BMW in 2 years and I love this X3. It is fully loaded (I got a dealer demo so got a great deal) and in the 2 weeks that I have driven it I got 22 MPG. I tried Acura, Infiniti, Volvo and Lexus. No doubt you pay a little more upfront, but once you drive it for a few years its all worth it - thanks to 0 maintenance for 4 years and the overall BMW brand value. When you buy a BMW you don't buy a car - you buy an experience."
car_294,A joy to drive,"I have had the X3 for about 6 months and now has about 10,000 miles.  It’s a great SUV.  Great handling, good power, controls are easy to use (but a little old fashioned for a 2008).  I like the panoramic sunroof though I rarely use it.  Gas mileage is fairly decent.  There’s not much room in the rear seat for passengers."
car_295,Fun and Practical,I have had my X3 for 6 months now and find it to be fun and practical.  It has been extremely reliable. I have the automatic and most options. I am averaging about 22 mpg. It is very useful for hauling around my dogs and for moving things back and forth to my daughter's college which is about a 4 1/2 drive away.  It holds a surprising amount of stuff.  The handling with the Sport Activity package is great. It handles better than my last sedan.  The navigation calculates (and recalculates) very quickly.  The xenon headlights automatically follow curves which is great for the dark streets around my house. The seats and steering wheel heat up very quickly on cold nights.
car_296,"After 11k miles, it's time to walk away","I leased this '08 X3 in December of '07. Unfortunately, I regret the decision. The X3 is no doubt an excellent driver for a 4100lb small SUV. By small, I mean the interior is very small and cramped and only after owning this vehicle for some time I now know it has limited utility and horrid resale value. Others such as the Lincoln MKX are cheaper by thousands and more practical in every way."
car_297,Overpriced Horrid BMW Model,"This is an update of an original posting.  The BMW X3 has HORRIBLE engine and transmission response.  The dealer can not remedy it as no more software updates are out from BMW but I do not think any more computer programs will solve the potentially dangerous throttle response; you do not go anywhere at times when merging.  The navigation system is awful I had to buy a Magellan unit.  The handling is sub-par, think the crappy cheap Pirelli STR part to blame but not up to BMW standards.  BMW corporate is impossible to deal with they are of no help at all."
car_298,Disappointed,"This is our second BMW,  we are so disappointed with the quality of construction.  The front bumper, a pathetic piece of plastic just buckled and fell when going over a bump.   Told by a BMW service agent that this is happening so frequently with the x3 that people are not even bothering to fix the bumper, they just drive around with it hanging.  This is unconscionably  poor construction, design and quality.  There are other issues with the quality of materials used in the construction of this car.  This is definitely our last BMW and if it wasn't a lease, I would get rid of it immediately."
car_299,2008 BMW X3,"I’ve had the auto 4 months, handling is outstanding.  Acceleration and braking also outstanding.  Interior fit and finish are top quality.  I ordered a 6 speed manual, a big part of the fun factor – the manual transmission is smooth and easy to use, although the position of reverse, to the left and up of first, takes some getting used to. The exterior finish is perfect. Dashboard and radio controls are different than most cars, but after a few weeks, it all makes sense.  While super unleaded fuel is recommended, the auto runs fine on regular.  My previous car was a Honda Pilot which was a nice solid car, but the X3 brings back the excitement of driving and everything still fits."
car_300,Love it!,"It's my first time to own a BMW.  I have to say:"" WOW!""  For a SUV, this one is easy to handle, easy to park, excellent engine, good acceleration and sensitive brake! The gas mileage is not bad at all! Plus the BMW ultimate service package.  I'm very happy with it!  It's been a week, I have a hard time from getting off the driver's seat. And when I'm out of the car, I couldn't get my eyes off it."
car_301,Bmw X3 Review,"This is my 3rd bmw. I have owned the 323 sedan, 325 coupe and now the X3. the X3 has the most power of the group but does not handle as good as the coupe. This is expected since it is a truck. I put in all the bells and whistles and only option I would not recommend is upgraded stereo. The Harmon Kardon upgrade in the 325 coupe sounded much better than the X3. I do not know if it is b/c the x3 is a truck and is bigger and more open, but not worth the money. I only have 200 miles on the car, gas mileage of the car is 13 miles. Hopefully that will go up as I put more miles on the car. I would highly recommend this truck, loving the view from up high and drives excellent."
car_302,The best vehicle I've ever owned.,"From the moment I first climbed into the cockpit of the X3 till now, it has been a great driving experience.   I used to think all the BMW talk was hype. Not any more.   Aside from the fact that this is the best handling auto I've ever owned, I am still discovering all the fine features of the X3.   Recently, I opened the sunroof. It opens the entire length of both the front and rear seating areas, wow.   I play my iPod all the time, and I think the sound system is awesome.   The bottom line is the 4 year or 50,000 mile warranty including all service and roadside assistance. Who else has this much faith in their vehicles?"
car_303,Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing,"Traded in an 06 X5 3.0i and love the upgraded engine BMW put into the X3 in 07. 800 less lbs to lug around, so it really flies. Got Prem, Sport, 19"" wheels, NAV, Cold Wthr, Xenon, Prem Audio, Servotronic. The car rides A-OK with 19"" wheels. It's got a taut, responsive yet compliant ride, just what BMWs are known for. Throttle response is lightning quick, but you quickly learn how to modulate it. Putting the car into SD mode *really* amps up the car's responsiveness. Tried out RDX (nice at first glance, but plasticky inside), EX35 (great engine, but even shorter on utility than X3), even the new X5 (too big, hate iDrive), but this was the one I had to have."
car_304,Great Buy,This has been a great car so far. No mechanical issues. The BMW engine is smooth and delivers the power when you need it. The suspension works really well too. It provides amazing road feel and yet is able to absorb our Chicago pot holes better than any car I've recently driven. The transmission has been good so far. When immediate passing power is needed I switch from D to SD for a quick burst of speed.
car_305,Smaller SUV,I was looking for better fuel mileage in a well built SUV with many of the features from my previous vehicle.  The X3 has more room than it looks.  It is well finished inside and out. I like the engine but the 6 sp auto trans. seems to hold onto gears too long and down shift easily.  Mileage is only about 21 in a mostly highway commute.  The ride is very firm and it handles well for an SUV.  The X3 reminds me of my wife's old 2003 530 in many of the interior operation components.
car_306,Remember - it's a BMW,"Remember, you're buying this car b/c it handles incredibly. Acceleration is great. I experience no hesitation. This car is fun to drive - lots of fun to drive. I get 21 mpg. However, the electronics are horrible. I got the upgraded stereo and wish I hadn't. Sirius costs $900 to install, only available through BMW and it's the worst antenna - continuously drops the signal. The read out is limited to the point of annoying. The radio only has 6 presets. The GPS (yeah I went for that too) is incredibly useless - difficult to use (the manual is awful) why do they allot so much space to longitude, latitude and altitude? It's ridiculous. Did I say it handles incredibly?"
car_307,Good Vehicle,"Purchased in march. Nice car. Looks are attractive. Features are excellent except navigation system. Navigation system is really bad, Honda has much much better nav system. Fuel avg is around 17-18."
car_308,Enjoying New BMW,"Purchased in Feb.  Terrific ride - very comfortable.  The oversized sunroof is a real plus.  Ordered Premium Package, rear side airbags, mats, heated front seats, metallic color.  Nice ride:  car performs beautifully.  So far, shows I'm only getting 15.6 miles to gallon, although alot of street driving.  No hesitation as mentioned in another post.  Very powerful and sensitive brakes.  This is a feature added as I read it's designed to perform right away.  Very roomy although rear has hump in middle seat.  The technology over just a few years ago is amazing.  Had another customer in car wash actually strike up conversation about how nice the car is."
car_309,What a blast,"What an absolute blast this little SUV has been from day one, It still brings a smile to my face every time I get to climb behind the wheel.  It sticks to the road like glue, accelerates bullet like away from lights (or as bullet like as you'll get in an SUV) and it's very comfortable.  We bought Alpine White with sport package and loaded it up with options.  Be prepared for sticker shock - big time !"
car_310,Just Not Worth the Money,"This is my 2nd X3 in 6 months.  I had so many problems with 2007 that BMW bought out my lease and I ordered another one (would not let me totally out of the lease).  These are overpriced and not up to par with Japanese vehicles.  Problems-- transmission does not mesh with engine, hesitation, brakes grab, OEM tires were AWFUL in snow last few weeks, took them off before slid into something.  Navigation system is archaic.  Radio even upgraded one just does not provide quality sound.  This is definitely not the ultimate driving machine.  I would never recommed an X3 to anyone else.  I do not know how other reviews are favorable.  Guess just taken away with BMW emblems all over the car."
car_311,Worth Every Penny,We've owned the car approximately one month and still brings a smile to our face while driving.  This is our first BMW and we're very pleased with the build quality and the fit/finish.
car_312,What a wonderful SAV by BMW,"Just got our 2008 X3 two weeks ago with all options except servotronic.  It's been wonderful so far.  We have the alpine white with sports performance package which comes with 19"" wheels.  This is a must have if you want the best looking X3 out there, it looks so much better than the rest.  The color coded aero kit makes this car look even better (no more black bumpers/moldings.  It drives like my 540 and it also has the cargo space to haul our weekend gears.  We have two kids and my wife can sit between the two car seats for our two our trip last weekend, and she's 5'8"", it is almost the same size as our 01 X5, but it is much quicker because it's 800 lbs lighter and it is also fuel efficient"
car_313,One great small SAV,"Got my 08 X3 two weeks ago, have all options except servotronic steering, sports performance package is a must, the 19"" wheels look so much better than the rest.  Alpine white exterior is the best color choice by far.  Automatic headlights is cool.  It drives like my 540, but with enough cargo to haul our weekend gears.  We have two kids and my wife can still sit in the middle between the two car-seats for a two hour drive.  It is almost the same size as my 01 X5, only quicker and more fuel efficient."
car_314,Maybe the anomaly but I can't stay silent,"Had the car for 11 months, timing chain work done by dealer at 59,xxx. Three weeks after driving it off the lot in January, it started skipping when you wanted to accelerate to pass. Turns out they sold me a vehicle with a bad spark plug and coil pack. Took it to get it aligned and the software for the electronic steering had never been updated. Fast forward to December, I get drivetrain malfunction alert. Turns out the turbo 4cyl engines are inclined to have an actuating piece the regulates oil flow get stuck, as well as having timing chain issues. Currently have a 16+k car that could potentially cost 8+k to repair. BMW is aware of the problem and cover it for 7 yr 70k mi. Fortunately for me there are 78k on mine PLUS BMW does not reset your warranty after they replace parts under warranty. Buyers beware."
car_315,Engine Clatter,Bought for my daughter to take to grad school.  In shop in Denver several times for engine clatter. Always told noise was normal and dealer never put on customer list for repair. I even called Denver dealer myself and complained. Told normal every time.  Over 3 1/2 years noise increased.  Now car won't start and noise now sounds like an old diesel truck engine!  I understand having trouble with a car but do NOT understand dealers protecting the BMW name by not completing what would be a very expensive repair while under warranty.  Do NOT buy BMW products.  Get over the looks and demand service.
car_316,Snazzy,I love the SUV smooth easy to handle comfort.
car_317,Nice but very fragile,"In 5 months after buying it I had to visit the dealership more times than in 4 years with my Mitsubishi Outlander! Something is constantly wrong with this car. But the last drop was it failed to start for the second time when it was cold outside, after(!) half of the trip to the school with the baby! I am no longer planning to keep it as it is simply unreliable. Yes, it gets fixed for free but what about my time and the inconvenience? Now it is sitting at the dealership and will be there for 2 weeks until they get a part, I am driving the loaner :(Update - I had to get rid of this car. Only after 9 months of ownership I have traded it for new Cadillac SRX. The primary reason was extremely low reliability. It failed my wife twice in winter and she was stuck in cold for hours (BMW roadside assistance was not answering calls for many hours). Clearly we were not alone :( Dealer tried to blame me for ""poor driver profile"", although even this is no true - I measured battery parameters and they were perfect. Not to mention that it's been 2,5 years and Cadillac works very well for my ""poor driver profile"".I still believe that I have not driven anything better than X3 in terms of quality of the ride and, especially, in winter. But, unfortunately, this has little value if you cannot rely on the car."
car_318,Loving the X3,"I have had four successive 5 series wagons. Sadly, BMW doesn't bring them to the states so I had to really consider what to get next. The X1 was TINY and just didn't feel like a BMW to me. Without question my last 5 had a more luxurious interior, but that's expected. The X3 has a much nicer interior than the current 3 series. The screen is IN the dash where it should be, not sticking up like a design afterthought. The engine/transmission combo is amazing; very quick and agile. It doesn't handle like a car, but much better than other SUV's. The tech package is very nicely done. Gas mileage is really good for the size. The car feels much lighter than my 5 wagon, much faster though."
car_319,Love My Ride,"5 Year Update I still love it and wouldn't select any other car. My BMW X3 still looks like, and drives like, a new car. No other car handles as well as the BMW. My friends and family all love my car. Family members continue to purchase BMWs. Last year we moved to a new state and the dealership here takes great care of us. Wouldn't drive anything else. 3 Year Update:I still love my ride!Other than a few very minor glitches, that the dealerships remedied, over the past 5 years I have had extremely reliable, excellent performance and would chose this vehicle again. In fact this year my sister bought one!It still rides and handles beautifully. The dealerships around the country have been very helpful in meeting my needs and addressing issues. Original Review:I looked at and drove nearly every car and SUV out there. When I drove the X3 35i I felt 'at home.'Also drove the 28i but even with the Turbo, didn't have the torque I'm used to. The 35i put a smile on my face!Performance, comfort, gas mileage, not to mention the sleek classy look. I have been asked if I am satisfied with the run-flat tires. They are expensive though I couldn't live without them. I actually drove over 1,000 miles cross country o a flat while I was traveling! What more can you ask for?"
car_320,Too many trips to dealership!,"It's a nice vehicle, if I didn't have to drive 45 minutes to dealership to get it fixed, on a regular basis. Yes, there is a closer dealership, but they tried to sell me an ""executive car"" for $3K off sticker.When I asked for car fax they baulked. It had been in a rear end accident!I only found out because I asked for Carfax!Anyway back to X3.It's pretty.And it's nice to drive. Holds road well. Handles great."
car_321,"Reliability , reliability , reliability .....",It's shocking that BMW can't make reliable car for the money they charge. This wk will be my fourth visit to the dealership for drivers restraint malfunction . They don't seem to know whats going on with this car . I have seen similar reliability reviews and I just wonder in the engineers at BMW read them !!!!!!! It's also statistically higher than other competitors or Japanese cars.
car_322,2nd review,"We now have about 12,000 miles on the X3. BEST utility vehicle I have ever owned. Fuel economy is right at 26.5 p tank. Have gotten as high as 32mpg when cautious? And this was obtained with mid grade. To date there are NO maint. Issues at all. Flawless vehicle and American made. Storm grey and oyster interior are cool in summer here in GA. As for the auto shut off....was rough at first but at about four thousand miles the process smoothed out totally. And it does help save fuel."
car_323,"Engine, engine, and engine, but that's all.","Drove BMW 328i for 5 years, now X3 35i.The engine is just amazing! Great acceleration. 8 speed transmission is so smooth that you can only tell changing gears by the exhaust note. Praised by many reviewers as ""Fun to drive"", ""drive like a car"", maybe true compare to other SUV, but it's not even close comparing to 3-series sedan. The 328i feels like it's glued to the road and have this solid damping of road roughness, but the X3 is wobbly and makes you feel every little bump. but to be fair, that's the case for all SUVs. I guess that's what you have to give up for a more practical suv.Update:A few years passed, getting used to the ride now. It's still very solid, no major repairs, some small issues through: 1. AC starts to behaves weirdly, sometime it cant be turned off, need to get that checked; 2. Driver side window started to get this clunky noise when rolled down;  3. Tire sensor failed to warn low pressure tire, ended up replacing the factory tire sooner then needed; It's a practical car, accelerates fast by SUV standard, but I really miss driving the little 3-series."
car_324,WOW sports car with a back pack!,"Bought this in alpine white on black and I call it my new spaceship. I also test drove the 3L engine but the 2L seemed lighter and much more responsive, not to mention for '13 both models have the same horsepower and torque! I traded in a Nissan Juke which was truly just a joke, super small, not safe, tiny 9 gal gas tank, no hatch space for a big grocery trip unless you put both rear seats down etc.. so this was a giant upgrade with absolutely no regrets!!! I wasnt a huge fan of run flats due to their cost if you even run over a nail, but i'm starting to be a fan of how thick they are for any bumps in the road, you feel practically nothing! To assure myself, I bought the extra tire warranty."
car_325,"Expensive, but you get what you pay for","Traded in my old 2003 BMW X5 for a shiny new 2013 BMW X3 28i.It doesn't have quite the build quality of the X5, but on the other hand, doesn't cost $80,000 either.Road feel, handling, steering, and general sportiness/fun are outstanding.The 28i 4 cyllinder turbo is surprisingly powerful and capable.Absolutely love the interior and all the tech gadgets (sat nav, bluetooth, large computer screen, whole music library on hard disk, etc etc).Very upscale appointments and nice touches throughout.Kind of a cross between an SUV and a sport sedan, for those who want both and are willing to pay a premium to have them both embodied within the same vehicle."
car_326,Wish I hadn't bought this car,"I ""upgraded"" from a Volvo XC90 2.0T to a BMW X3 because I wanted something, smaller, zippier, and with modern electronics (bluetooth, ipod interface, & nav). Well, I did get smaller. Prefer my old Volvo or my husband's new Subaru Outback.Not pleased with:Back hatch doesn't not close well - half the time I get a message that the back hatch is open after I close it with the push button. Electronics are ""fussy"" to use - you can use the joystick on the center console to go to radio or ipod, but you still need to turn the sound knob on the dash to ""on"".Why two steps?And why does BMW make ""Park"" a separate button on the transmission stick from Reverse & Drive?TG it's a lease."
car_327,BMW X3 35i,"superb SUV. Acceleration and handling are great. I have about 6000 miles in 4 months and love every mile. We get 26+ miles per tank....every tank. Pure hiway will get 29. This car is comfortable, reliable, economical, fast and very useful in everyday life. VERY easy to get in and out of. Seats are supportive and comfortable. Great cargo area with easy access. Good hidden storage also. I love this ""truck"". Bottom line.........I recommend this vehicle to all in the market for a midsize SUV."
car_328,Mileage overstated!,"My 6cyl 3 series averaged 28.4 mpg on the highway when traveling in the 80-85 mph range. The X3 is in the area of 18mpg.Now, if I slow down to 70 the mileage jumps up to 26+.Of course on the highways of AZ and CO where the limit is 75, traveling under the limit is somewhat risky as the normal flow is near 90. Overall I really like the X3, and I suppose 18 mpg on the highway for an all wheel drive isn't horrible, although my previous Explorer was over 20 mpg.Driving within normal limits I average 27.6 combined. I notice no difference in performance or MPG with different gas grades. So it seems as if the cheap stuff is just fine in the cool weather and mid-grade when it is warm out."
car_329,The X3 is Awesome!,"I love my X3. After test driving the RX350, Mercedes GLK, FX35 and the Audi Q5 I kept going back to the X3 couldn't remember the features of the others only that of the X3. The back seat is roomy enough for my teenage son. I like the quietness of the ride. I haven't found anything that I don't like about this vehicle yet. Great birthday gift to myself"
car_330,Best mid size SUV available.,"Have owned two Tahoes, an X5, and still have a BMW GT 535 and love it. Took delivery of my X3 two months ago. It was delivered in perfect condition by Athens BMW. We have put 2500 mile on the car and average right at 26 per tank. Thats about 1/3 city driving. This SUV is QUICK and with sport sedan handling. The seats are great and visability outstanding. The 8 speed is flexible and always goes to the right gear for optimum passing and handling. My golf bag fits w/o having to put seats down. Luggage space is plentiful and with easy access. Engine runs fine on mid grade. Plenty of storage space for driver and pass. The covered storage just left of the steering wheel holds a small 9mm perfectly"
car_331,ALMOST Perfect SUV,"First of all, the most annoying feature of this car is the automatic engine shut off!It shuts off the engine when you stop unless you disable it.This is very annoying and will probably destroy your starter if you keep using it to ""save"" some gas.My brand new 2013 X335 has scratches on the paint and had to be repainted.The glass had some scratches too.Overall, my 5 series from Germany was flawless when I got it.Must be poor worksmanship from USA factory."
car_332,X3 rocks!,"I bought this SUV after extensive research and test drive of many SUVs for the past one year that includes RX350, Q5, FX35 and MB GL.this is the perfect SUV that both me and my wife fell in love. this SUV is fast, fun to drive and comfortable. the back seat roomy for its size and as big as RX350. the interior is high quality and I love the technology package that gives you all the latest gizmos.I get 21 in city and 27 in highway. the interior is quiet and luxurious. it is gives stand out of crowd that owns RX350s and MDXs."
car_333,The best of all worlds.,"So, I will preface this by saying this is my first car review. I have owned a few X5s, X6, and X6M.All were fun, and all had purpose... but none were as all around great as the 2013 X3 35i.The engine is a blast and being attached to the perfect size chassis just tops it all off.There is enough room to haul what you need, without being overly large.The back seat room is awesome for such a compact SUV.Having a 3 series a few years ago, this feels quite similar but with more utility.I was hesitant when I ordered it, but I have no regrets now.I challenge you to drive the competitors and find one that is better all-around."
car_334,Satisfied 2013 X3 Customer,"I researched options for a ""retirement"" SUV that would satisfy my need for utility and enjoyable driving at the same time--the BMW X3 has met my expectations in every way.The car handles like a sports car, carries 5 adults comfortably and accomodates my bicycle as I find places to use my new free time.I was a bit concerned about the power of the 4 cylinder engine but it has ample power with the Turbo assist.The buying experiences with client advisor Lonnie Overby was a ""no pressure"" and pleasant experience in every way, and I would recommend him to anyone."
car_335,Glad I bought it over the Q5,"Love this car the more I drive it and still trying to figure out the functions. The car has great maneuverablity and I am able to zip in/out of traffic while feeling very much in control. Pick up is very fast and good in all driving modes, but a bit hesitant around corners after a complete stop."
car_336,I Do Not Let Car Reviewers Decide For Me. I Do.,"I would have never bought this great machine if I had to decide based on what I read in some biased reviews. With BMW ownership for years, the X4 35i is another fantastic car the roads and driver should love. Inside out. Go test drive one and do not pay attention to some BAD, BIASED, SUBJECTIVE reviews. Decide for yourself."
car_337,great,great
car_338,Worst decision ever!,"When you purchase a new car you expect a New Car! I understand it might have issues here and there but when you have to take the car in 5 times in a 6 month period. Please note the car was BRAND NEW 5,300 miles at that point.  Battery Discharge (just rest the system), Left parking light issue (all they did was reset it), Headlight issue again (now apparently the entire headlight needed to be replaced),  Front center air-vent had to be replaced. All this issues and the car still did not meet the ""Lemon Law"". They couldn't even just replace the car. Now there is an apparent recall for safety. This car has just been a headache and the service department at Mckenna BMW was no help at all. We are returning customers as we own a X5 (2014) & 320 (2014). Will we be returning customers? NO!!!"
car_339,Sport Activity Vehicle I'm in LOVE,"Shop around for the best purchase or lease, don't let your eyes do the talking for you. Make sure you are knowledgeable about the various packages available the pice points do increase!!"
car_340,"Fourth BMW, and best one yet","Just picked a practically brand new x4 35 xline from Momentum Motorsports in Marietta Georgia.  Driving the 350 miles home on the X4 was better than the 350 miles up their in our 2011 535i GT, gas mileage up was 27.3 on the GT and back home it was 25.7 on the X4.  Really liked everything about it so far.  Probably could have one or two more nook and cranny places to hide things but its ok.  Prior to the 11 GT we had a 07 X5 4.8 and a 535i and loved all of them so far.  The X4 is faster than the x5, 535i GT and faster than our '14 JGC overland with 5.7 hemi,   our 2002 jeep wrangler with 31's would smoke the X4 in the mud though, ha ha. With NO maintenance cost first 50k miles, why not own a beemerUpdate: after owning it for almost a year, still the best and most fun ON the road car we have owned, wrangler with top and doors off most fun off road"
car_341,Perfect size SUV with style,"I've always driven sports cars, but I occasionally need some utility, and I've been searching for years for a vehicle that gives me the best of both worlds.   I loved the X6 when it came out, but it's just huge   We looked at X1s because they were cheap, but it seemed a little small.    A buddy got the X3, and we thought it was the perfect size, but just so utilitarian looking.   The X4 finally hit all the right buttons. 

Many reviews complain about the backseat being cramped.   A very tall friend of mine can't fit into the front seat of some vehicles, but finds the back of my X4 spacious.    Tighter than an X3 perhaps, but perfectly usable!"
car_342,Not just a pretty face,"I would never consider the frumpy X3, but this X4 (3.5i MSport) was very appealing. Same platform, very different driving experience. I must be the target X4 niche buyer: partial to BMW's particular driving dynamics and styling, buyer of a mid-sized SUV with emphasis on sport/performance, don't want a boring box-sided SUV, only occasionally use the back seats, early adopter of new technology, willing to pay a little more for performance tuning and less-boring styling."
car_343,A Distinct Driving Experience,"I got the car last week and it has been a joy from the moment I open the garage door.  I got the XLine in graphite gray and Lighting package, navigation, and parking assist."
car_344,Love this car!,"Just got the car from Bob Smith's Calabasas and I'm loving it. It drives like a dream and has lots of ""hybrid"" qualities for driving around town without burning a ton of fuel.I called Chase at Edmunds Live Advice and he helped me with numbers that made me feel like I got as good of a deal as I could get on this brand new car. I'm very happy :)"
car_345,"First generation X3, true BMW","First generation X3, a true BMW. Probably too firm for most American drivers but I'm very sure footed easy to park compact SUV. Great for changing road conditions. Never loses traction with the great X drive"
car_346,Practical mpg and traction - Fun driving dynamics!,"2009 BMW X3 with full options - I bought this car used in March, 2017 with 83,000 miles on it to replace a 2007 BMW X3 with 165,000 miles which was the nicest car I had ever owned.  This one is better.  The transmission on the 2009 is smoother than the 2007, this one has the upgraded stereo and it sounds better, but also just the tuner knob is nicer and easier to use.  It could be just my perception, but it seems more stable in corners at speed.  Gas mileage is great on both - I get 21 or 22 mixed, and 26 to 28 highway in the Rocky mountains between 50 and 80 miles an hour.  MPG is one of the best features, and it comes from a powerful engine that is ready to pass anything, anytime even going up a mountain.  Front seats are fully adjustable and very comfortable.  Drive noise is quite minimal, making it hard to drive anything less insulated.  The over all size is small, which I like for fitting through traffic an parking, and I find the cargo space to be large for the size of the car.  Traction control with Michelin X-Ice tires is excellent on snow, frozen hard surface snow, and clear ice.  Braking is crisp and tight, as is the steering.  The ride is firm, but I found I like it better than Mercedes ML350 and ML 550 that I test drove.  Driving it really does feel like a sporty car - much better visibility than a Porsche Cayenne, and the Porsche and Mercedes 550 felt too tight in the cockpit for me.  I'm 6'3"", and my only real complaint is that the transmission box is wide in the X3 and pushes my right foot in at an odd angle that makes my knee and hip feel tweaked.  It bugs me, but when my 2007 got totaled by a friend, and I had to replace it, after looking at the Mercedes and a Mazda CX-7, this one is just soooo fun to drive (and the gear shift is useful and fun) and gets such good mileage, that I couldn't get as excited about anything else.  **If you get one, you must rotate tires regularly.  Irregular wear on tires will confuse the traction control and transmission and make you think it's a junk car, but it's your tires and/or suspension**"
car_347,Mary Ann - Warwick,I had a 525i sedan and traded it in for the X3 which is as classy and luxurious yet more practical for my life style.  Either vehicle is fabulous!
car_348,The Perfect All Around Vehicle,"Due to an old back injury I needed something with more supportive/ comfortable seats that was easy to get in and out of. I tried almost everything out there until I found BMW's X3. The seats and height were absolutely perfect so I ordered the car based heavily on those two things and relied on BMW's reputation for the rest. I certainly was not disappointed. It goes and stops like nothing I have ever driven and if you don't watch your speed it will easily creep into triple digit territory. It corners like it's a car and although firm, it rides like a dream. The fit and finish is top notch and the cabin is quiet. It has great head and legroom and everything is where it's supposed to be."
car_349,This can't be an SUV,"My wife was tired of her Camry and wanted to sit high in traffic.  Looked at the RX350, the E35 and even the new GLK, but nothing matched the driving dynamics of the X3.  I don't even like SUVs, but I really enjoyed driving this one.  Brakes are even stronger than in my Mercedes, and perhaps the best highway ride of any car we've owned.  Only complaint is the stereo controls are small and look alike, which is a common problem in BMW interiors.  We got a very basic X3.  Vinyl seats, base stereo, no nav and no option packages.  Ours has the automatic, heated front seats and privacy glass; no other options.  What is amazing is that even without any of the packages the car looks and feels great."
car_350,A+++  X5 BMW SUV,My X5 BMW SUV has lasted me 14 years with minimum repairs of tear and wear. It's not bad on gasoline and it is beyond safe. I absolutely love it and will pass it on to my son when he is ready to drive.
car_351,BMW - The ultimate Money Pit - Bee Emm TroubleYou,"Purchased 2002 BMW X5 back in early 2012 with 85K on the odometer.  One owner vehicle.  It's been a long and sad 4 years.  Currently at 122K.  List of issues:  Instrument cluster was pixelated, used ""BMW's good faith"" one time repair to fix it.  From then on, it's one thing after another.  Poor tire reliability, need to replace tires every other year (every 10K or so) even after having the alignment done multiple times and buying quality tires.  2 window regulators replaced.  Inside drivers door handle broke, fixed it, 2 weeks later, outside door handle broke, same door.  Factory radio stopped working, replaced with aftermarket Kenwood head unit w/Navigation.  Power Steering reservior cracked and leaking, had to replace it.  Now it gets fun....Transmission and transfer case literally blew chunks all over the highway at around 105K miles,  paid 5 grand to fix it.  Then had to replace tie rods and other misc. suspension parts.  Temp sensor and thermostat failed, had to replace those along with water pump.  Currently in the shop to replace manifold parts due to Service Engine Soon light.  I know it's an older vehicle and repairs would be frequent, but I was under the impression that a fine German automaker like BMW would be rock solid, but stupid little things like the door handles breaking?   Oh, and the engine burns a quart of oil ever 1200 miles or so, they say it's normal....really?  I have heard to never own a German vehicle out of warranty/above 60K miles, I can now see why.Yeah I know....but It's my wife's vehicle and she loves driving it, hence why I dumped so much money into it to keep her happy.  When it runs, it's quick, has a lot of room and the ride is very nice.  The leather interior is great, but mechanically it's just falling apart.  I have owned various Toyota and Nissan vehicles and they never had issues like this... My 14 year old Corolla only needed a Starter in the entire time of ownership.Will never, ever buy another BMW again."
car_352,"X5 4.6is Fun, but expensive","I bought my 2nd X5 - a 2002 BMW X5 4.6is with 120k miles on it.After two weeks of owning the transmission failed and had to be replaced at a cost of $4k.The dealer wanted $8k to replace, but did work with me on the installation of the rebuilt one I found online.The vehicle is powerful and fun to drive, but I've spoken with other owners who have experienced tranny failure, so this may be a systemic issue.My first X5 was a 2001 3.0 and I did not have any issue with it."
car_353,"45K Driven on '02 Sport in 5 Years, Just Can't Let it Go","Having owned 3 consecutive 4.4l BMW from 5 to 7 to X5, I have liked the pwr. pkg. & the 5-series is my fav. Even w/o driving this one much I could never sell the vehicle. Safe and responsive 4800lbs., fun to drivethe 4.4l pwr gets the same fuel economy as the 3.0l (so go for the 4.4l). Typical mechanical wear over time. Sport Model wears tires on a staggered 19"" wheel (can be altered to matching 255-55-19) with a tight suspension for handling. Offers an addicting drive response w/performance from optionl steptronic if desired, you could probable take the 5-speed to 125MPH in 4th gear, just stealth performance."
car_354,Stay Away,"I bought my very clean and well maintained X5 used about 2 years ago for about $7K.  After a few thousand spent on the regular stuff, the timing chain guides disintegrated.  After one year in the shop and a $7K repair bill it is still running rough and un-driveable.  It has 118K on it and has been well kept.  My first biggest mistake was buying it and my second biggest was paying to fix it thinking I would have a re-built ride.  Don't be seduced by the comfort and fit/trim/etc.  These things are a ticking time-bomb.  I sort-of enjoyed it for 11 months after buying it even though it was a bit fussy with little stuff during that time.  Basically that breaks down to $1300 per month that I spent on that disaster of an experience.  Also, don't be fooled by the appearance of more than one star as a summary of this review because I had to give credit for comfort, etc.  None of that is good enough to overcome the massive expense of timing chain failure."
car_355,Worst car or truck I have ever owned!,I have owned 6 different 3s and bought the suv for my wife because she wanted a suv.I have had good luck with my other BMWs but this X5 was the worst thing I have ever owned. It does have power and does drive more like a sports car then a suv but the thing was the worst built car I have ever owned. Everything that could go wrong has.I had a few friends that worked at the dealership and they told me they are junk but I already had purchased it and was stuck with it. After I started having problems I did some googleing and found tht everyone has the same problems. I amabout to post it on craigslist for parts. I will never own another BMW. Crappy service too.
car_356,2000 BMW X5 4.4i AWD Automatic,Finish and quality of materials is first class. Performance is awesome! It handles in curves like any other BMW X5 or X6.
car_357,"Love It, But Wouldn't Buy It Again.","SAV drives and handles awesome.  I've loved it since owning it. It is quick, fast and fun to drive. BUT... it does have its quirks.  Speed and weight causes brakes to wear. Electronic issues at times for heat, lights, etc. With 70,000 miles, the real problems have now started (and it looks like I'm not alone).  CV boots & front axles had to be replaced.  One month later, failed transmission with no warning.  Dealer quote for transmission of $8,300 to replace.  Although I love this vehicle, research tells me I can expect further serious problems and it is time to get rid of.  (Contrast my '92 325i with 150,000 miles and still runs like new.)  Now, looking at Porsche Cayenne."
car_358,Don't buy this SUV,"Few months after driving this car with 42k miles the warning check engine light came on, had to change the whole electrical harness $700 out of my pocket few months later both front axles had to be change $1500 battery sensor $300 fuel tank sensor $300. Finally two years later had to sell it was driving me broke."
car_359,The Ulitimate Driving Machine,"I've owned the BMW X5 for about 2 years now and what can I say is WOW. It is really an Ultimate Driving Machine. This is the best vehicle I've ever owned. But within the first year I had to replace a 4K Transfer Case, a 900 dollar inspection, 1400 dollar brakes, 1100 dollar tires, 600 dollar window regulator, 1200 A/C Compressor. But hey I really love the vehicle and I'm sticking with BMW for Life. Don't set your reliability standards to high because again it is the Ultimate Driving Machine not your typical Ultimate Honda Machine."
car_360,This luxury SUV stinks big time!,"I purchased this car used. The list of problems goes on and on and pretty much resonates what I have read from others so far: Tires have to be replaced every six months due to excessive wear and tear, coolant tank and hoses had to be replaced and the car is still leaking coolant, and best of all, after 100k miles, it needs a new transmission. The cost? $6,000!  The X5 has far too many mechanical failures to deal with which ultimately makes this model not worth it in the end."
car_361,Mechanical Nightmare,"I purchased this car with 38K miles and have had it 3 years.  It is a great car to drive and has tons of power. Downside, a mechanical nightmare. I had to have new brakes and rotors at 40K miles.  Had the cooling expansion tank replaced, both power window motors replaced, door lock cylinder replaced, water pump replaced as well as all hoses and belts since they had it apart.  Also had a bad tail light piece replaced, and one CV boot on the front axle replaced.  It also wears tires out very quickly because of the negative camber that BMW installs on these things.  Worst car I have ever owned mechanically."
car_362,Engine Gasket Problem,"Purchased a lightly used 2002 X5 which runs well except When the coolant light came on,  $2000 dollars to replace gasket at 70K miles. Watch out BMW not taking responsibility for poor engineering. Found out this is a common problem with all of the 4.4L. BE CAREFUL!!  OIL LEAKS TOO. Buy it cheap or stay away - learn from my mistake!"
car_363,It's still a BMW,"We purchased our X5 to haul a family, and it's definitely an interesting compromise between sport and activity/utility.  Agile for an SUV, when you drive it like a BMW, it's rewarding.  The 3.0 lacks some punch for a car of this weight, but the mileage and agile handling still make it a good choice.  BMW didn't package the X5 as a minivan substitute; it's still lacking the big-gulp capable cup holders and clever use of interior storage of dedicated family haulers, but again, this is a compromise when a driver needs a family car."
car_364,Good but not Great,I have this X5 with Sport Package as a compromise between owning a fast sedan and owning a practical family car.  I save on insurance in MA by not having two cars.  I have not been disappointed.  It will go well over 120 mph when I want and it tows the boat to the cottage a couple times a summer too.
car_365,Convincing my wife,"This has been a great, but not troublefree, vehicle.  Our first BMW.  I had to convince my wife that she would enjoy this SAV.  Now I cannot get her out of it.   It has never stranded us, but we have gone to our dealer several times answering the ""service engine soon"" idiot light. This light has alerted us to a loose gas cap AND a bad catalytic converter.   Both on the same idiot light.   My wife uses automatic.  I use manual shifting.   It reminds me of my first car--a stick shift way back in the 1950s.   Great cornering and passing power."
car_366,Best Sports Car Amongst SUVs,For an SUV this has been a great car for an auto sports enthusiast.  Original tires (Michelins) were the worst thing about the vehicle.  Once I put on good tires it has handled even better dry/wet/snow and nothing else got worse.
car_367,Better vehicle to be designed yet,"This is my 3rd BMW and 5th in the family. Once you drive a bimmer, you don't want to drive anything else. I got the top of the line X5, fully loaded, OEM navigation, OEM TV, DVD changer, screen in the back, bluetooth, hatch, reverse camera, AV jack in the back, heated seats all around, integrated V1 detector, voice recognition. Mechanically this is not a car, this is a beast; I have pulled 140 MPH on this car, and it did not even shake or rattle. It even felt like it lowered itself to the ground; I know it has automatically adjust ground clearance. I had to back out, as it was too scary. I had driven in many countries, and can't trade a BMW for anything else other than another BMW."
car_368,BMW X5,"Great car runs well, build very good, exterior design the best, interior excellent, mileage good, performance excellent."
car_369,Exceeded my expectations,"I bought my 4.4 V8 as a certified pre owned. It was a prior demo with 21K miles on it. Now I have 54K with nary a problem. Change the oil, fill it with gas and go. And this baby goes, it handles just like a sports car. It is solid and tight. still has the new smell in it, from the ultra luxurious leather. I opted for one WITHOUT the sports package (the ride still is a little on the stiff side) but has everything else. Everything looks and works perfect,every time I detail it the car looks and feels like a brand new car. There is a lot to be said for BMW build quality and enginering. I still have the original tires and changed the brakes only once at 40K miles, unbelievable for a 4400 lb car."
car_370,My first bmw,Every time I switch cars with my wife and son I realize what a real driving machine this vehicle is - you just have to sit behind the wheel to experience how it performs - it is such a solid well built vehicle.
car_371,The truck that drives like a car,"Since day one with this car I've never regretted its purchase. It handles better than any non German car I've ever owned, let alone any other SUV. It's never left me stranded, and has always been a pleasure to drive. That includes two cross country trips with the family."
car_372,Fun to drive!,"Wow.  Let me say it again.  Wow.  At first I thought the interior was a bit gaudy, but I got used to it in about 30 minutes.  Most of the controls make sense.  Only control I have trouble with is the back hatch -- it's placed underneath an overhang next to the hill decsent and at night you can't see it --  but you can see the hill descent (hint:  I don't need to see that at night with the interior lights on).  Luxury feel, but sporty ride.  Very quick & nimble with very little ""float"".  Accelerates quickly, fantastic headlights, I can actually see the road and the brights are BRIGHT.  Windshield washer, computer and everything else makes sense.  Accessories galore! Stuff I never thought of!!!"
car_373,Great SUV,"I bought a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) 2002 X5 last year (2004) and after a full year of ownership I can say that this is an awesome car! The 3.0 engine has more than enough power and is silky smooth.  The interior is typical BMW - clean, crisp, and functional. I opted for the standard handling package (not the sport package) as the ride with the SP was way too harsh for me and my family. Some people complain about the gas mileage, but I have been averaging around 19 MPG (50/50 city/hwy) which isn't too bad.  The CPO warranty saved me around $1000 in repairs (new electric window lifts). Overall, I have been very, very happy with car."
car_374,Great SAV...better then Japanese,"I was in the market for a month, and test drove x5, fx 35 and rx330 and rx 300. Finally picked up the 02 X5 best bet for the money.  Got all the looks and style and performance. Sportronic is great, and my wife can drive it too with autonomic mode.  Great stability and ride comfort  Exterior styling is more aggressive then rx 300 or Rx 330.   Its a great performance handling truck"
car_375,New to the BMW,"I recently bought a used 02 X5 4.4, I wished I'd read these articles first.  One person said he had problems with the mirror and seat memory -- ditto here.  I have wasted time on several trips to the dealer to be told ""We can't find a problem.""  No code found.  I can't get a trailer hitch because they're on back order.  I cannot get an aftermarket rear entertainment system because no one has any positive experience getting them put in.  However, it is a mechanical beast.  It is a jack-up sports car and it moves.  Some days I think about getting rid of it but when I clean it up, I like it, and other do too."
car_376,Best car yet,"I have owned way too many cars, but I enjoy this one by far the best, and I sold a Benz E-Class to buy this vehicle. Operates like a BMW, which means great performance, but is also very comfortable with plenty of space for trips with my wife, my bicycle, luggage, etc."
car_377,Beware the Electronics Demons,"I have been a BMW buyers for over 20 
years. This is a good hybrid of a SUV 
and a sports car. Interior is 
functional and comfortable with only a 
few annoying problems. Interior door 
handles are coated plastic and had to 
be replaced in the first year when 
paint peeled. Radio constantly fades 
in and out even with local stations. 
Gas pedal is too small. Rear leg room 
is minimal if tall occupants are in 
the front seats. Electronics are 
constantly on the blink. Been an 
ongoing problem for over a year now. 
Dealer can't seem to fix. Brake 
warning and service engine lights stay 
on all the time. Dealer is 2 hours 
away and day-long trips to try and fix 
are getting tiresome. Cargo storage is 
minimal."
car_378,Now to be critical,"Now for the rest of the story...

Sports pkg...Don't ask for a rotation 
because tires smaller than front.   
Darn expensive tires with less wear 
than normal.  As a result you 
get ""cupping"" which creates road noise 
after 1/2 life of tire.

Electrical...Bulbs go out like crazy.  
Lost Pixels in the lcd displays had to 
have element replaced
window silinoid (sic)...I have had 2 
replaced.  You sort of get used to 
the ""gunshot"" sound when the windows 
drop for no reason at all.  Won't roll 
up until silinoid  is replaced.
Don't plan on getting good service if 
you live in DFW.  There isn't a dealer 
in Dallas that seems to care about 
your business.  Are you listening 
Huzanga?  or John Roberts?"
car_379,"Good Perfermance, poor durability","I bought this car new and it was great 
until the 50k mile warranty expired. 
That's when onboard computer readout 
started to go bad... just the start of 
one big headache. The resale is awful 
on this car. Also, car had a noise that 
the dealer was never able to fix. Goes 
thru the oil, fast. Maybe I just got a 
lemon."
car_380,The Bubba Truck,"Been a Ford Chevy man all my life but the wife liked 
the X5 and to repent for all my fishing and golf 
trips, and to keep taking them, I reluctantly agreed 
to buy har an X5.  Mistake!!!  I'm married to a 
BMWer Junkie!  She loves it and wouldn't have 
anything else!  I too have come to like it more than 
I'll admit to her.  The handling in terrible weather is 
awsome, and the power is unbelieveable.  The 
brakes are the biggest and best I've ever seen.  The 
car has to be one of the safest ever made."
car_381,Best ever,"Without a doubt, the best car I have 
ever owned. Great on long trips, in 
town, etc."
car_382,Great SUV,"Love it.  Best handling and most fun to
drive SUV ever.  I have test almost all
of the luxury SUV's on an offroad test
track and the BMW performed the best."
car_383,"Fun to Drive 8.0, Reliability 4.0","My first BMW at 12K ball joints replaced,emergiency 
brk replaced, radio died-water leaking inside. Never 
been able to get key to consistantly return seat to 
memory position. Drivers door frozen most Jan, Feb 
mornings, crawl in through back. HORRIBLE in 
snow, only good thing is DSC keeps you from 
sliding off into the weeds. Rain sensing works 
erraticly. 44K all new brakes incl front rotors, 
ball joints rattling again. Interior dr pull finish 
chipped. Do we really HAVE to agree to legalities 
EVERY time we start the car to use radio, nav 
system? Heated seats set to RUMP-ROAST."
car_384,Pre-owned - satisfied to date!,"Shopped for an X5 for months. Didn't 
want to pay the $50,000 for a brand 
new so I found a 2002 X5 3.0 with only 
17,000 miles on it.  Extremely clean, 
hardly driven car.  Have driven about 
1,000 miles so far and have loved 
every minute.  This is my second BMW 
(1997 328is) and they are by far the 
most amazing DRIVING cars in the 
world. The X5 lives for 80+ m.p.h. on 
the highway.  3.0 is plenty peppy off 
the start with plenty of torque but 
lacks some power at speed.  No big 
deal though. Read all about the 
electrical problems in the 2001's 
which made me stay away from them. 
Paid $37,250 for a 2002 w/every option 
but NAVIGATION. (bought 7/10/04) 
w/17,000 miles"
car_385,My first truck,"My 6th BMW. Best feature: EASILY 
the most comfortable ever for a a long 
drive (lumbar support seats are 
fantastic). Next, sedan handling and 
performance. I've achieved a better 
time than the 528i over my fav route of 
hiways and country roads. Most annoying 
feature: the AWFUL tinny noise when 
shutting the door. Biggest SMALL 
annoyance -  unreliable warning LCD 
icons e.g. is a breakdown imminent or 
is it simply an icon fault (again). 
Great fit & finish but qual of BMW 
materials declines yearly (like 
others). Best was my '85 325E. Still 
luv 'em. I went to MB once(300 coupe). 
Soulless - a big mistake. MB briefly 
had my brain; BMW will always have my 
heart. Cor"
car_386,Great Sport Sedan / Acceptable SUV,"I have had basically good experience 
with my X5.  I am a sport driving 
enthusiast and this is my family and 
commuting vehicle.  As an SUV only the 
price for the functionality is kind of 
high.  But, I like to drive.  This one 
has the sport package.  Basically, I 
gave up nothing in the fun to drive 
and handling areas to have the utility 
of an SUV like vehicle.  It is fine to 
drive, unlike the wallowing beasts 
that other makers put out as SUVs.  I 
hope I can drive this until the wheels 
fall off."
car_387,X5,"Great driving vehicle.  Terrible 
electronics.  Always something wrong.  
Automatic settings for seats, 
mirrors,etc. only work 50% of the 
time.  Been back to several dealers  
many times - no one can fix it."
car_388,Look No More,"After two years, I know we made the 
right decision. I only wished that we 
decided to purchase the X5 in lieu of 
the M CLass first. If you are looking 
for a SUV with performance and looks in 
one package, the X5 is the only one for 
you. If you are serious on buying the 
X5, dig a little more in your pocket 
and get the 4.4L since it offers more 
punch and standard equipment. If you 
add all the standards on the 4.4 
compared to the options in the 3.0 for 
the same car, you will see that it is 
only a bit more. Believe me,you will 
not be disappointed!!! Happy driving!!!"
car_389,BMW X5 Rocks,"Other than dealing with a small cargo
capacity, the X5 has been our most
favorite car ever owned."
car_390,X5 3.0 Blk on Blk Sport!,"I love everything about this SUV.  
Except for its electronics.  I have 
winter, sport, navigation, dsp ... etc. 
I have 30K on this SUV, and so far it's 
been a disappointment.  My passenger 
sideview mirror fell off, my door does 
not open and close at times, windshield 
special wipe doesn't work properly, 
radio/dsp doesn't work (NO SOUND!!!) 
Doors, warning flasher, reading lamps 
comes on for no reason when driving.  
2002 X5! What a disappointment!  Don't 
buy this SUV!"
car_391,2nd and last BMW,"Fast and good handling as long as the 
road is bone dry.  Slides on wet roads 
even with anti skid.  Snow is the 
worst.  Doors and windows freeze shut 
in sub freezing weather.  Locking 
system is impossible.  Pieces of 
molding fall off.  No where near worth 
the high cost."
car_392,Love My X5,"I purchased a predriven X5 and love 
it. The quality and reliability of BMW 
afforded me the confidence to by a pre 
driven car and not have the worry. 

I came out of a van and was ready for 
a luxury car but wanted the style of 
an SUV. I will keep this car for a 
long time!"
car_393,I LOVE MY X5,"I absolutely love my X5.  Before I 
purchased my X5 I drove a few other 
luxury SUVs and found that the X5 was 
the best overall in handling, comfort 
and performance."
car_394,X5 is the best suv,"i love this vehicle, can't think of 
anything bmw is lacking"
car_395,BMW X5 4.4I,"this is the best vehicule, that i have 
been driving in the past 10 years 
handeling and quitness is howesome, 
performance is great. i would recommend 
this vehicule to anybody this is not a 
true SUV but a hybrid, i would no use 
this vehicule for off road. this as 
great handeling in rain great fiture 
like rain sensor, smart remote, drive 
like a sport car but it is a SAV."
car_396,Good overall after 1.5 years,"I've driven my 3.0 for 21,000 miles and 
have had a good experience thus far. 
Major complaints are the software 
glitches (fixed at 15k service), 
terrible cup holder location,  various 
squeeks and rattles.

The biggest disappointment is the 
squeeks and rattles. One in the back 
cargo area and one in the CD cover 
shield when down (leave up all the time 
now). If I wanted to deal with quality 
issues such as this I would have bought 
a GM or Ford. This has been a big 
disappointment."
car_397,THE BEST SUV,"I own my x5 for 1 year already ,and 
only one world is capable for this 
vehicle...exelent.Alot of people 
complain about small cargo area,but 
when you bought a bmw for 60g your 
concern is not put a 4x8 shetrrock 
inside a bautifull leather and wood 
truck.There is not other like the x5."
car_398,BMW X5 Review,"This has been a very good car.  It now has 120000 miles.  The only thing other than reg maint was the transfer case/transaxle was replaced at about 75000 miles.  This wasn't under complete warr.  BMW shared the cost even though strict maint had been documented.  At 117000, I installed a new alternator .  It cost 350.00 which was a deal compared to the 750.00 that BMW wanted.  I did the labor myself.  I repair cars for a living so I keep very good maint schedules on my stuff."
car_399,This is a SUV,"After a year of casual driving, this 
3.0i still performs like new.  You can 
see and feel the craftsmanship from in 
and out.  The Neon lights are nice, the 
bold rear mirrors, and of course, it's 
BMW name (not someone said:  Big 
Mouthed Woman).  After a year of 7,000 
miles endend driving, there has no 
problem yet.

The set-up of on-board computer seems 
to be more than sophisticated than you 
want, but, live a real life then."
car_400,2001 BMW X5,The Ultimate Driving Machine!
car_401,Best Vehicle ever owned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The BMW X5  is attractrive not only 
for it's safety features but it 
perfomance.  My X5 is scary fast still 
drives like new and I have never ever 
had a mechanical issue.  I will drive 
this car as long as I could."
car_402,Very happy with X5 4.6is,"I have owned a number of BMWs (97 M3, 
2000 M5, 2002 745i) and two X5s (2001 
4.4i and 2002 4.6is). I liked the 4.4i 
and I like the 4.6is even better. In 
fact, I had a 2002 745i that was 
incredibly unreliable, so I traded it 
after six months for the 4.6is. 
Although the X5 is less technologically 
advanced, I don't regret the trade. The 
X5 is far more comfortable, more 
practical, less pretentious, and I 
enjoy it more. With comfort or sport 
seat options, the X5 has the most 
comfortable driving position of any car 
I've ever driven. It has been very 
reliable so far."
car_403,Experience with BMW X-5,"In 4 years and 49000 miles this car 
has been in the shop for a repair just 
twice, both under warranty.  The car 
is as tight and fun to drive as the 
day I bought it.  I never keep cars 
after the warranty has expired, but in 
this case I am making an exception.  I 
can't find another car I like any 
better, and it is so good I figure 
maybe to save a little money and stay 
with it for another year or so."
car_404,Best SUV yet,"This is the best SUV I have owned yet. 
A few minor issues, but considering how 
much is packed into this vehicle, I 
have no complaints. Extended warranty 
is probably a great investment. And of 
course....let's not forget the tax 
benefits."
car_405,Best Driving SUV on Road,"I've read through some of the reviews 
and am very surprised to hear about 
numerous electrical glitches. I've 
owned my 3.0 since 7/02 and have put 
about 11k miles so far. I have not had 
ONE electrical (or other)problem with 
the car. Even though the Xs are built 
in America, it is by no means an 
American SUV. It is still German 
driving, through and through. There is 
no American SUV that can come close to 
the absolute driving pleasure this car 
brings. Even with the AWD, the car is 
deceptively quicker than you think. 
Have driven other SUVs and this is 
completely solid at any driving speed. 
I feel safe and in control in this car. 
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!"
car_406,NoneBetter,"I cannot imagine driving a better 
SUV.  Aside from the 16mpg I average, 
the vehicle has no downside.  During 
my first year of ownership the X5 was 
not a common sight on the street and I 
had dozens of people ask me about 
it.   Now they have become very common 
and I can understand why.  Mine is 
powerful, extremely comfortable and 
incredibly fun to drive.  It's also 
given me a terrific sense of 
confidence, driving through the snow 
that was dumpen on the east cost this 
past weekend."
car_407,X5,"I owned a Corvette and a 4X4 Jeep Grand
Cherokee SUV until I purchased my X-5.
The BMW combines both vehicles into one.
 It handles like the covette and has the
utility of the Grand Cherokee.  I will
never by anything else."
car_408,BMW X5 is a lemon,"Goes back to dealer monthly for 
electrical problems"
car_409,the truth,"car has gone to the shop many times.

in dash gone bad.All little things.
car is under warranty so it is ok but 
for 57000$ ??????"
car_410,My new 02 X5,"After owning several Bmw vehicles, i 
have finally reached the pinnacle of 
bmw quality combined with a fun to 
drive machine.  I am very impressed 
with my X5's power, performance, 
comfort and off road prowess during the 
unexpected snow storms we received this 
year.  I will definitely be keeping 
this vehicle and look forward to 
getting another new one in 2 or 3 years."
car_411,X5,"The BMW of sport-utes earns its stripes 
with outstanding handling and 
acceleration, coupled with class-
leading ride quality and way above 
average fuel economy.  My 2000 has 
never been in the shop other than for 
scheduled maintenance.  At 42000 miles 
the tires have another 20,000 in them, 
and the front brakes were just replaced."
car_412,X5-Love Hate Relationship,"Have 2001 x5 3.0. This car while a fine 
performer has had electrical problems 
from day one.  Found my windows open  
over 15 times.  Car still takes twice 
to start. Remote only worked when it 
wanted to until recent trip to 
dealership when they spent 1 week to 
redo electical system.   Taking off 
trunk cover is major pain-broke it 
twice doing so. Twice had rear deck 
wiper 
blade torn off in car wash-must have it 
bagged or else. Friend had his car in 
over a dozen times for similar problems 
and ultimately BMW bought car back.  
Dealer says problems are now worked 
out. Still love to drive this car but 
am disappointed."

IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE IT CAN GET ANY 
BETTER THAN THIS!"
car_414,Just want to rate this vehicle,"Overall very happy with the X5. Nice
styling and great performance all in
one.  Great handling in Lake Tahoe as
well as touring around town.  Nothing
beats it in my books."
car_415,Looking for another brand next time,"Many small things have gone wrong or 
broken in the vehicle, which meant many 
trips to the dealer to have them 
repaired. There were two major recalls, 
one regarding faulty acceleration, I 
almost gone plowed over by a tactor 
trailer when the truck did not 
accelerate through an intersection. The 
other for the braking system.  Not a 
very pleasnt BMW experience for me and 
I was a tried and true customer. This 
was my third BMW.  I am looking at 
other brands for my next SUV!  Check 
carefully the cars history if you buy 
one used."
car_416,"X5, An Engineering Work of Art","2002 3.0Sp (white with sand and light

This is one first rate machine that is 
truely amazing. If I had all the money 
in the world, I would still choose this 
exact vehicle. The inline 6 is the 
smoothest engine in the world. Sweet, 
beautiful, classy responsive, solid and 
safe. What a combination!"
car_417,2000 X5 Rating,"For a first year production the X5 has 
proven to be a top performer. The X5 
includes all of the BMW 
characteristics as the other models.

We have experienced only minor 
problems, e.g. key remote control of 
outside mirrors is not consistent and 
is a problem BMW knows about.  The 
console became difficult to open and 
was corrected.  
The tailgate has been criticized 
because it has a top and bottom that 
open independently. However, when you 
open the top part of the door 
everything stays in place rather than 
rolling out and down the hill, thanks 
to the bottom part of the rear door.

Performance is awesome!  It handles in 
curves like any other BMW and is a 
thrill."
car_418,"The Sportiest ""SUV"" Out There!","A true BMW performer! Have tested many 
other vehicles and always kept coming 
back to the X5. V8 is very fast and the 
quality finish is superb. Very sexy, 
eye catching and very safe, especially 
in a crash! Once you drive a BMW, you 
will not go back to anything else, it 
just gives you that special feeling and 
you know that everyone around you 
wished they had one too."
car_419,BMW X5,"I have owned my X5 for approx, 18months. I have more fun than I have ever had 
driving. While the cargo space appears small, its capacity has never been an 
issue. The backseat room has generated more positive comments than any other 
vehicle I have ever owned. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a 
great SUV that loves to drive. One thing to remember is get the 4.4litre engine. 
Makes all the difference in the world."
car_420,2002 BMW X5 - A True Superstar!,"This is the finest automibile that I have ever owned.  In fact, it is the finest 
vehicle that I have ever driven.  The X5 has an uncanny ability to predict what 
the driver wants (and needs) and does it for / with you.  It is refined and 
comfortable.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat and will continue to drive one 
unless the rumored X7 comes out and then I might try the X7.  The safety 
and comfort offered by the X5 is second to none.  It is comfortable on long 
trips and is a blast on windy roads!  It truly is ""The Ultimate Driving 
Machine!"""
car_421,The Anti Slug,"I just sold my 2003 Range Rover HSE 
which I had for a month for the X5 
4.4.  I tell you, my nickname for the 
Range Rover is the  Slug-Rover, up 
hills will take you a decade.  Even 
though the X has less cargo space it is 
worth the 50,000+.  It is a true Bimmer 
at heart, or engine. Hope you consider 
this when buying."
car_422,incomparable,"The vehicle is awesome.  Though some 
may cost less or have a little more 
cargo room, nothing compares...I know 
because I drove them as well.  Anyone 
rating another higher must not 
appreciate true workmanship, 
engineering, and capability...you do 
get what you pay for."
car_423,Best SUV Anywhere,"This car is incredible! It only looks 
like an SUV but under the hood it is an 
M5 sports sedan. The car is truly a 
well thought out machine with amazing 
performance and looks. I have never 
come across another SUV that could out 
perform it except for the time I ran 
across an X5 4.6 on the highway, Wow 
that thing is blazingly fast!"
car_424,Solid So Far,"I have had my X5 for about 8 months.  
It has been everything I had hoped for: 
fun to drive and comfortable.  
Everything is solid.  Not a rattle or 
other problem (knock on wood).  The 
paint job has been particularly 
impressive.  I have taken a lot of rock 
hits at highway speeds, but I have not 
yet found one chip!"
car_425,Take a long test drive,"Purchased the X5 because it had the 
most headroom of any of the BMWs.  
Found the seats very uncomfortable and 
after a few 1000 miles, can confirm the 
criticism that the car lacks storage 
space.  (The twin cup holder in the 
center console, which holds one cup of 
coffee, is a joke as demonstrated by 
the fact that there is now an after-
market cup holder being sold for the 
X5.) Airbag light came on after 2,000 
miles but am optimistic problem will be 
easily solved.
Make certain you are comfortable with 
an SAV that is for carrying passengers, 
not stuff."
car_426,Simply the Best,"Just took delivery of a X5 4.4.  
Previously owned a 01' 530ia.  The X5 I 
find is built better and more solid.  
Tons more enjoyable to drive.  Gas 
mileage is okay given the performance 
and weight of the vehicle.  So glad I 
changed vehicles.  Never looked back at 
my decision to trade the 5 series.  The 
price may be steep but well worth it."
car_427,x5 -da best,"The structure of the x 5 is incredible, 
My family and i love this car. the 
comfort and luxury of this car is 
awesome."
car_428,"Great SUV, And it Goes Offroad","I really liked this SAV. I had a 2000 
Land Rover Disco II before this one.  
It was great off road and looked sharp, 
but lacked handling, breaking, speed, 
and road comfort the BMW has.  I have 
pull trailers with the BMW and gone off 
road.  Don't be afraid to do so.  Just 
don't climb over any boulders.  
Otherwise, its 4WD system is great and 
can handle most areas.  I also like the 
gas mileage."
car_429,X% a bummer and NOT a bimmer,"The X5 looks great and performs well 
during the first year.  However, the 
vehicle does not keep ""chuggin"" like 
the other BMS's I owned.  This one is a 
true American car.  All the platic 
pieces start failing at 25,000 miles 
and the brakes, transmission and AC 
fail at less than 30,000 miles.  
BEWARE!  The X5 is not really a BMW.  
It's good looks hide faulty workmanship."
car_430,Best car in the World,This car is the best
car_431,BMW X5,"I think this is great mid sizetruck but
a bit low on cargo space"

always wanted a tough but civilized car 
that can hawl a payload then take you 
to the opera?  Really, the X5 is the 
car to buy. I absolutely love this 
beauty/beast."
car_433,BMW X5,"The X5 holds the road well has 
excellent pick up and responsive 
steering.  It also has a really stiff 
suspension.  One of the most 
comfortable things about the X5 is the 
cabin is abosolutely silent.  Driving 
on the highway at 70 miles an hour you 
can't hear a thing."

When I ride this car I feel like  I'm 
young again."
car_436,Delighted so far,"Overall, this is a fine vehicle. We are 
very pleased with it so far. If I stay 
longer I am looking at purchasing the 
restyled unit when BMW does it. 
Everywhere I've been It's a head 
turner. That's saying something for a 
vehicle that is from this country (I 
know it was built in the states). Still 
has a smooth ride with the 19in wheels."

for a little over 2 weeks.  Very 
responsive, and effortless climbs 
uphill."
car_438,Get more than you pay for!,"There is nothing else like it.  The X5 
is a wonderful do everything big sports 
car."
car_439,BMW review,"My BMw has given me excellent 
performance on the road, as well  
comfort and luxury. Driving it makes me 
feel like i'm driving on air; it's so 
easy to manipulate and it drives 
smoothly and has alot of power that 
makes it a feasible option for me to 
drive. for once I can enjoy driving. 
I'm more than satisfied with its 
overall design and it gives the optimal 
performnce i require."
car_440,What an amazing car!!,"Seriously looked at the M320 before a friend recommended that I check out 
the X5.  Never really noticed it before and that's because so few of them are 
on the road.  Started researching and went to the dealership to check it out. 
It's was love at first sight.  Had to have this car.  After the longest two 
months, drove it the first day nonstop for 6 hours straight!  Unbelievable!  
Looks and finish are like no other on the road with the exception of the new 7 
series.  Handling and safety features are also like no other.  In addition, it's 
an attention getting for sure (even from M drivers!) and truly a blast to drive 
which is surprising with a car this size and weight!"
car_441,Nice Ride,"I have had my X5 for 4 months now and 
have put 9000 miles on it. I have had 
no mechanical problems and have been 
impressed with how nice it is to drive 
in town and on the highway. I have a 
couple of little glitches, bad wiper 
blade on rear wiper and a piece of the 
ceiling liner not tucked perfectly into 
the overhead console. I think that BMW 
has a tendency to overdesign its cars 
but this doesn't necessarily result in 
the best reliability.  If you want the 
least amount of trouble generally a 
Japanese vehicle is the best choice. If 
you want safety, solidity, and by far 
the best driving experience buy BMW.  
That's what the X5 is about."
car_442,The Best of the Best SUV,"Safety!  You feel very relax, it give 
you a sense of the surrounding, and it 
performance and handling informs you 
the vehile every move.  Tested several 
SUVs including Mercedes ML, nothing 
come close to the X5!  Highly 
recommended..."
car_443,3.0 X5,"Amazing handling and a joy to drive. 
Drives like a car and hugs the road. 
Have driven Japanese and American 
models and this car by far is the 
best. A bit pricey but worth every 
penny (for now) until the competition 
makes a SUV that looks and handles 
like this X5. Occasional electrical 
gremlin will show up but so far 
nothing I can duplicate to get fixed."
car_444,2002 BMW X5 4.6si,The best car I ever driven.
car_445,Not a real BMW,"This SUV is ideal for people who prefer 
fine looks,elevated view of the road 
and allwheel drive system. but this 
isn't for BMW or driving enthusiasts 
because it really isnt' a typical BMW. 
It's also built in America."
car_446,The one for me!,"Of all SUV's the X5 is above and 
beyond.  I call it a high riding sedan, 
there's nothing truck-like about it in 
that it gives a smooth ride and handles 
curves well."
car_447,TBD,"Just purchased a 3.0 for the spouse. 
Will be testing it on the Bahn. More to 
follow. I am however concerned about 
the lack of A/C power. I've test driven 
this car (German spec) on numerous 
occasions and didn't see a problem."
car_448,Not Bad,"I have the X5 3.0, 5 speed.  My 94 
Explorer cannot compare to this 
vehicle. My X5 has great handling, very 
comfortable and not bad on gas. At 
first I did not like it (which was 
strange), but the more I drive it I 
liked it more.  Great Vehicle."
car_449,problems only,"I got my x5 3.0 for a 4 months now and 
went to service for 5 times .
First week- check engine light on(bad 
fuel cap)
second visit - same problem plus 
problems with memory seats (no 
solution).
third visit - check engine light again 
(bad fuel hose)plus headlights getting 
foogy (new driver headlight) 
fouth visit - problems with am radio(no 
solution still suks!) plus headlights 
getting foggy again (passenger side)
fifth visit next week - temperature in 
chicago 90 degree and a\c is not 
working. Dose anybody has the same 
problems ??? Let me know"
car_450,4.6L- Unbelievable,"Just picked up the X5 4.6L about a week 
ago.  The only word to describe it is 
unbelievable.  The 20 inch rear tires 
are quite a sight from a trailing 
vehicle's perspective, and that is the 
most likely view the majority of other 
vehicles are going to get.  Incredible 
handling and acceleration.  Interior 
finish is also superb."
car_451,improvements needed,"We went from a Jeep Cherokee limted to 
an X5.  The X5 is made for performance 
more than luxery.  Some items that I 
would add are a screen that displays 
the gas milage left, and direction 
headed.  The car is very fast, and 
comes with blinds for the back windows."
car_452,"My Sweet X5, what a car","well let me tell you, the first day i 
got it i drove untill midnight. This 
was just to see how much i will love 
this car over the six years i plan to 
own it. While driving not knowing where 
i was going, i felt like a king, this 
is due to the high quality comfort i 
got. i can't wait to take it off road. 
I guss my Boxter is goin to be in the 
garage for a while."
car_453,Awesome,"Not much to say.....best driving 
vehicle on the road regardless of 
price.  Fit and finish is impecable and 
interior ergonomics are near perfect.  
Would recommend to anyone looking for 
the ultimate suv/sav."
car_454,What's not to like.,"I was asked if I like my X5 and my reply was ""what's not to like"".  As in true BMW form the X5 is a fine automobile.  I have nothing bad to say about this car and mostly superlatives when talking about it.  The 4.4i engine is responsive and fast.  The transmission is smooth as silk and matches perfectly to the engine."
car_455,As close to perfect as I can imagine,My only gripe is that the cupholders need to be able to hold 32oz bottles or cups.  12oz beverages are a German thing I guess.  The performance is excellent and I highly recommend going to South Carolina to the plant to pick yours up.  What an experience!
car_456,satisfied,Replaced my 2001 3.0 premium with a 2002 3.0 w sport pkg.  Like the improved ride and handling.
car_457,Most fun car I have ever owned or driven,This car is pure fun!
car_458,BMW Fan Forever!,"This is my first BMW and I am never going to drive any other brand from now on. I love it, love it, love it! Although it may seem very pricey, it is well worth it.  It has all the makings of a dream machine: speed, agility, luxury, and toys galore!(I'm still finding little perks here and there). I got it with the Xenon lights, heated seats and steering wheels,auto-dim mirror and moonroof, all pricey features but you won't regret it because they are oh so nice! This car does all the thinking for you on the maintenance factor, all you have to do is enjoy the drive!"
car_459,Peppy ride and Comfort,"The X3 is a pleasure to drive, very responsive yet sturdy and quiet. I love the iDrive controller and the Heads Up display. Firm yet comfortable seats."
car_460,Beware-Great drive/poor value,Be sure you have lots of money to spend on upkeep- once the warranty is over it will cost you. Dealer costs are very high and parts are astronomical. I love the way the X3 drives but if I were to do it over I wouldn't. My dealer wanted $500 to update my navigation map! Ugh!!In fact I just traded the vehicle for another non- BMW.
car_461,Good car,This is a good car; the acceleration and the breaking system doesn't see to be all that great but I feel safe in it.
car_462,Love love love my new BMW,Easy drive ability! The seats heat up fast. Electronics are easy to figure out even for an old person!
car_463,After 5 BMWs this one was my last,"I want to start by saying this was a lease car and i am glad it was a lease i could walk away from.  i have had 5 other BMWs before this and with this and My 650 convertible i have switched to Lexus.   As far as reliability goes, i never had a problem.  it always started and stopped, and ran like it should.  My problems were the crazy electronics and dealer handling.   1st problem--it has automatic rain sensing wipers, but unlike other cars with automatic wipers, you have to manually turn them on every time so they will  work.  so they should be called manual wipers.   2nd problem--the parking sensors have to be manually turned on every time when parking.   they automatically turn on when backing up, but if you are parking they don't come on unless you turn them on every time.   if you are used to sensors that are automatic on other makes of cars, you can hit something thinking the sensors are working when they are not.  3rd problem.  the tire pressure monitors freak out with any change of temperature and when they do, you have to take it to the dealer to get them to reset it(this happens about once every week in oklahoma or so).  you will get sick of going to the dealer because you cant reset it yourself and it wont let  you go into sport mode with a tire error.   it also over rides the backup camera and you can be backing up and the camera will shut off to warn you about the tires which can lead to an accident.  4th problem. 5th problem--while the phone connects automatically (with a long delay) to the car, it often wont connect the audio so you have to go in every time to manually turn it on.   this is about 5 screens into a menu. this occurs about 90% of the time  6th problem.   the audio never remembers where you left it tuned.   it will start up in stations i never listen to or settings that i don't use.  i bought it new so these are not the previous owners settings.  7th problem   the car on several occasions opened all the windows and sunroof over night(twice when it rained) for no reason.  not a pleasant thing to wake up to.  8th problem--the tailgate can be opened on the remote while in drive.  if you put a key in your pocket or purse and it bumps the tailgate button, it can open on you while driving.   this has happened numerous times at stoplights and drive-thrus and will freak you out and make you get out of the car to shut it manually as a risk of getting run over at a stop light.  9th problem--the run flat tires cannot be fixed, only replaced.   they also wear out extremely fast on the X3 you will get about 25k miles before they have to be replaced.   the 650 only gets 15k miles between replacements.  you have no spare or place to store one so switching to better tires that are not run flats leave you with no spare if you do get a flat  10th problem   too many things are settings in the i-drive system.  the system is cumbersome and very menu heavy and not intuitive.  you have to go through menu after menu when it would be better to have more things on one page and less page changing.  11th problem  you have to use the i drive button to accept terms and conditions every time you start the car if you want to use anything on the nav screen.   starting my car is a process.   i have to hit ok to the disclaimer that will pop up every time i start the car.  then wait for the tire pressure monitor warning to come on so i can clear that screen, then i have to go 5 screens into the radio menu to turn the audio from my phone back on(it doesn't work every time and sometimes i have to switch back and forth between radio and bluetooth several times for it to switch on.  then i am ready to drive.   i have timed this and it takes about 2.5 minutes on average. if you don't think this is a long time try waiting in your car for 2.5 minutes while having a someone honking at at you because he wants your parking space  12th problem--when i first got the car i could turn the car off and it would automatically put the car in park for me.   after a software upgrade from the dealer, the car will freak out if i don't place it in park before i turn the engine off.  13th problem.  when locking the door from the outside touch button, it takes about 15 seconds to actually lock.   you will have to stand with the car to make sure it locks before you walk off and i end up hitting the button about 20 times before it actually locks the doors.   there is no delay if i use the remote, but then i have to dig it out of my pocket and that defeats the purpouse of a key fob  14th problem is with the dealer in Oklahoma City.  if i have a problem, there is a week delay to bring the car in to get it worked on.  if i want the free rental car they offer, there is a 2 week delay to bring the car in for servicing.  My local lexus dealer can get  me in the same day with a rental car  15th problem.   while hey claim everyting is included in the warranty including brakes and oilchanges, they dont include alignment, which had to be done twice"
car_464,BMW X3 A Jolly little toy for adults,"Bought my X3 xdrive28i  3 years ago and drove it about 13 000/year. This car is a real pleasure to drive every morning to work. It takes away the boredom of the drive to work early every morning  I work about 25 miles away and my ride takes about 35 mn so I drive quite a lot. I used to dread that drive but this car made my mornings much more fun. I drive a mixed mileage on the highway and normal roads. The drive on the highway is a real breeze. I drive it on the comfort mode and the car has plenty enough of pick up to pass cars without any problems even at high speed. I am very surprised by the amount of power this little 4 cylinders has even when I go over 80 mile per hour. You can actually have a lot more pick up by switching it to the sport mode, which has great acceleration power, when you merge or want to change lanes fast.  This car is a lot of fun to drive. If you are lucky enough to live in a region with back roads, you can have a lot of fun to drive it. I live in PA and the car is great for hills and turns on tight roads. It grips the road. In one word, it drives fantastic. I took 2 trip to South Carolina with it and it drove fantastic. The interior is simple but looks great. I have the special lights on it and good God, they are amazing at night. The car also has an amazing break system that saved me a few times from hitting dear at night. The car all wheel drive is great on the snow. I used to have a Subaru Outback and I think this car is better on the snow. It comes with free maintenance for 4 years. I never paid anything until now except my inspection every year and a set of tires. Now for the negative. Not much to say the truth. The tires/wheels are the only thing I am having a problem with. In the winter, the pressure on the tires can vary quite a lot depending on the temperature. My dash board showed a few times a low pressure on the tires. I had to go to my gas station a few times in the winter to put air in my tires. I have Pirelli zero all weather run flat tires on this car and get ready to spend at least $350 to $400 per tire when you change them. They don't last long either (25 000 miles at most) but they are silent and grip the road. I guess this is the price to pay for performance tires and the security of run flat tires, but you can install normal tires that will cost a fraction of these if you prefer. The car does not have a spare wheel in case of a flat but BMW has free 24h road assistance included. Most insurances do too. My insurance went up by about $30/month when I switch from my Subaru Outback to this car too. The gas mileage is not great (21 miles at most per gallon on the highway) so I use the eco mode when I drive in the city (it does not save you much anyway). It shuts down the engine when the car stops which I like (you don't have to use this if you don't want to). The options are expensive and the price of the car can go up in a hurry. The head lights are well worth it though and I like the GPS on it once you know how to use it. The ondrive system is great (it links my I-phone 6 through bluetooth to my music and pandora automatically when you start the car without having to do anything but not to your e-mail. BMW does not allow texting and e-mailing while driving). The music system is not fantastic unless you get the upgrade (12 speakers) which is amazing and worth the money if you like to listen to music (loud and clear). That is the only regret on my car. I should have got this cause when I got into another model which had it, what a difference it was. Overall, this is a fantastic car. I have no regret about this car. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. This was the best present I ever bought myself for Christmas. Not cheap but if you have the means, you can't go wrong."
car_465,Great if you have money for repairs,"Very expensive to repair. Check engine light remained on 2x. Once for faulty fuel sensor and 2nd for software problem.  Back hatch would not open - no manual way to do so and cost to repair was $2,000 and took full week to correct. Run flats are a joke.  Good for about 30,000 miles and cost almost $400 per tire. BMW Connected Drive can be frustrating as it does not always connect. Find the voice activation poor. Other than that the handling and performance lives up to its reputation."
car_466,Blue Water baby,"This x3 is an agile and fun ride.  Zero to 70 mph in seconds, quiet even after rattling around farm to market roads with farm or remodeling supplies. The color is very nice and even when I might exceed the posted speeds, no tickets so I am (tongue in cheek) thinking it is stealthy too!  It is very cool looking and I've had lots of positive comments from both men and women so not much of a ""chick ride"" in my opinion.  Only drawback is the built in safety feature that I dislike... If the driver or front seat passenger doesn't hit the unlock button positioned dead center of the dashboard then your passengers must ""double tap"" the door handles to open, which roughly translates to them trying to jerk the darn things off of the doors even if you remind them repeatedly!!!   I wish that feature could be disabled but my service advisor tells me it can't."
car_467,Love averything but the tires,"I have had this X3 for 2 years and love everything about it except the ""run flat"" nitrogen filled tires. Twice a year ALL my tires show low tire warning with the temperature change. I live 25 miles form the dealership, so it is a little disconcerting. The dealership ALWAYS takes care of it timely as long as they are open. That is my only complaint on the entire car.  I love the comfort and convenience of everything on the inside. The headlights are amazing as I live outside the city and drive on long roads that I need to see the sides of the roads for deer etc, and a long way in front for any hazards. The mileage is great for the size of the engine I chose, which I love. Great pickup and great handling."
car_468,Plenty of power and plenty of fun.,"I recently bought a loaded, low-mileage, certified pre-owned 2014 X3 with the 4 cylinder turbo engine.   I was concerned that the 4 cylinder engine would be short on performance.  But, that is not the case at all.   The car gets up and goes, especially when it's in Sport mode.  You don't need the bigger 6 cylinder engine to have fun in this vehicle.   I have taken my X3 up into the mountains along with 2 passengers and luggage.  It went up the mountain without breaking a sweat.  The turbo powered engine along with the 8-speed transmission works flawlessly and always keeps the X3 it's toes.   Plus, the handling is amazing.   I have owned some sporty coupes over the years, and this X3 feels just as sporty as any on them.   I love it!"
car_469,Very nice and quite expensive with options.,"I recently ""test drove"" a pre-owned 2014 X3.  The dealer was very knowledgeable and we ended up driving about 15 miles during my drive.  The car had 34K miles on it, yet it still looked new.  The leather seats were in great shape.  I have read some articles that mention a firm ride.  I have been driving for 45 years and the X1 has one of the nicest (and sportiest) rides of the many vehicles I have driven.   The ride was certainly not overly firm.  In fact, it was downright fun.  When the rear seats are folded, there is a surprising amount for room.  If you want to have a little fun while driving your small SUV, this is the one to get.  I just wish the new models weren't so expensive.  Forty-five to fifty-five thousand is a lot of money for a small SUV, regardless of how nice it is.    BTW:   I did not reply to all of ratings because I did not have the opportunity to try all of them."
car_470,Great Compromise,"My wife wanted a mid size SUV which was NOT front wheel drive or front wheel biased.This pretty much directed us to Audi Q5, BMW X3and Mercedes GLK350.Each had its strong points, but the BMW X3 had the most useable space and no real negatives.We're very happy with our decision. Ours was pretty well optioned and had the highest sticker price of the 3, but with USAA and BMW incentives, wound up the least expensive.The base engine has plenty of zip and is reasonably fuel efficient (not quite up to EPA estimates, but still not bad).It handles nicely on the road.If I did not drive a Mercedes E350 Sport, I'm sure I would be more effusive in my praise of the X3.After 2-1/2 years, my original review is still accurate.  I have never had to take the car to the dealership except for routine maintenance.  My wife is the principle driver and she loves the car--excellent visibility, crisp handling, super functionality.  She uses the car typically as a ""grocery getter"", but on 4 trips of about 500 mi. each, the car performed flawlessly.  We have had no second thoughts about this purchase."
car_471,Offer an upgrade for back seats!,"I have now owned my car for three months.Over-all I really like it and love the way it looks.It is $10,000 less than the Mercedes and I think it's a better deal.However, the back seat is very uncomfortable on trips.I also disagree with those who say there is plenty of room in the back seat.I wish BMW would offer an option for the same quality of seat contract in the back as they have in the front.Other than that, I can find little wrong with this car.I also love my dealership (Daytona Beach Fields BMW)."
car_472,Fantastic all purpose vehicle,"Very impressed with this 3.5 x3 after one month, the heads up display along with steering wheel voice command and what is now a very easy to use i drive system make it very simple to drive the vehicle, change radio, adjust navigation etc without removing your eyes from the road.Suspension and engine are amazing, if you can avoid the hilarity of flooring it, the vehicle gets reasonably impressive fuel mileage.Build quality is top notch and I like the fact that the styling is very conservative.With all the fun stuff, doubtful that anything short of the new Porsche can match it for speed agility and functionality."
car_473,fantastic vehicle,"Purchased vehicle about a month ago and have driven 2200 miles. Was nervous at first about 4 cyl engine but it has plenty of power. Recently got 27mpg on trip and that was better than Lexus 400h we traded in. Special ordered vehicle just the way we wanted with tech,parking assist, xenons, upgraded stereo and convenience package. Vehicle is very comfortable on long trips and heated steering wheel is a nice on cold nights. Build quality and dealer experience was first rate. We did purchase tire hazard warranty because of the run flats."
car_474,BMW Fan Forever!,"This is my first BMW and I am never going to drive any other brand from now on. I love it, love it, love it! Although it may seem very pricey, it is well worth it.  It has all the makings of a dream machine: speed, agility, luxury, and toys galore!(I'm still finding little perks here and there).

This car does all the thinking for you on the maintenance factor, all you have to do is enjoy the drive!"
car_475,SPORT activity vehicle,"The BMW X5 is the most wonderful car on the market.  All its styles are praised for accenting the characteristics of a Sport Activity Vehicle.  If one is looking for a bullet-proof truck with the ablility to compete with luxury sedans and sports cars in the same price range, this well built German beast is worth consideration.  Needless to say, the X5 has a distinct lead on all SUVs in the world.  The BMW X5 truly is an outstanding SAV.  If it were up to me I would put it in its own category: SSAV(Sporty Sport Activity Vehicle)."
car_476,Best SUV By Far,Excellent on highway or city.  I had a 5 series sedan and the X5 compares very favorably on driving fun but I can also throw my bike in it as well as on top.  AWD will take you anywhere a sane person should go. If you can afford the entry price and the maintenance get one.
car_477,Exhilerating,"I have owned M-Benz' in the past and then bought a 2000 528iT and thought that was simply incredible.  But the X5 is awesome, simply awesome.  Its exterior design is simply breath taking.  But wait till you slip behind the wheel.  All I can say is that you are in complete control driving the X5 whether you're taking it easy at 45mph or hauling at 105.  If you have never been in love you will be now.  DRIVE THE X5, OWN AN X5, AND LIVE WITH AN X5!!!"
car_478,Powerful Muscle SAV,"Power, Fun, & Excitment.  That's all in this SAV!"
car_479,2001 X5 3.0I,"Doesn't start on first turn of key about 40% of time. My 20K Honda always starts on first turn.  Dealer doesn't recognize problem.  Window Shade clips break easy..poor design. 2001 model assumes that casette tapes are in and thus provide storage for them...Car is loaded with features..Navigation system is difficult to turn off(voice) once it is on.  Computer infor system loses its brain occasionally requiring user to inout the dates/times,etc. I reported this but BMW can't find the bug......"
car_480,BMW Rating,"This vehicle is such a blast to drive.  The interior is awesome and loaded with more toys than you can probably remember how to operate.  I've driven many SUVs, but none of them have come close.  The price tag is a bit steep, but it's worth it."
car_481,One car does it all,"After owning Land Rovers, Land Cruisers, we tried the new 4.4 X5 It drove like a performance car on highways and mountain roads. Yet, we have driven the X5 on the same off roads and forest trails, it handled them as well. Only limit, road clearance less than Land Cruisers, BUT, far more power, handling, braking. Best overall car we ever had. Solid quality, excellent finish."
car_482,The superstar 0f SUVs!!!,"The more I drive it the more I love this car. The performance of the 3.0 is impressive. Must say I was suprised at how well It handles, it inspires confidence.Super fun to drive. This is my first BMW, it  will not be my last."
car_483,X5 3.0i,This is a great vehicle.I bought it because it had awsome safety.It is worth paying up for. I think it is my favorite car in the whole world.
car_484,Excellent Car/SUV,I really love my X5 4.4i. Every time I get out of it I just can't wait to get back in! It's such a joy to drive. I have had a few problems with the radiator system though (overheating and such) but it seems to be fixed now and all was covered under warranty.
car_485,Great value + safty,"10 years ago I was in a bad auto accident.  Since that date I have taken notice of safe auto's.  The X 5 might be the safest SUV on the road.  Style and confort are great.  10 air bags.  The gas milage is like most SUV's.  The X 5 drives like the 530i.  Great value and all wheel drive lets you go in the snow.  Buy one, you won't be sorry, just broke."
car_486,Don't buy the 2003 BMW X5 junk junk junk,"I don't know if BMW is still making the X5, maybe they corrected the problems but I know their customer service sucks they will not address the problems with the transmission shifting on its own on flat land going up a hill is cool going down and he'll put it in neutral but I'm flat land is going to shift 3rd to 2nd 4th the 2nd 3rd to 2nd 4th second drives you crazy surprised the engine didn't explode in the one of the engine leaks oil everywhere"
car_487,Reliable old Rock!,"I've owned the SAV since new and it still runs like a Swiss watch. One early glitch, fixed by the dealer A.S.A.P. Great dealer experience for years (Boston). I now live in FL and given the age of the car I have it serviced at local shops specializing in BMW/German cars. I baby my cars. This one has 108,000 k. Had it so long it is hard to remember that it was cutting edge when new. It is easy to forget that some of the flashy gizmos available on new cars today were not available in '03. It is a crazy good driver in all weather and conditions. Power/torque feel stronger than stated. Handles, brakes and corners like a thoroughbred. MPG OK for age, better on newer models. Interior has held up well. Had a few minor parts replaced. Dealer did some at no cost after warranty was up. Was a city car, so I gave it a facelift two years ago and looks showroom. Weaknesses? The radio, esp. AM. I don't listen much. FM is better. Diodes are blinking off in the instrument displays, which is a major weakness of all X5's of the era. If you are handy, you can buy rebuilt computer units on Amazon and install yourself. I keep the tires inflated above the stated PSI on the doors and ride and MPG are better. Will be trading in a year or so. Nothing in the current BMW lineup interests me, but have my eye on a MB GLC300.Update: Recently traded the BMW for a '17 Lexus NX200T. It is proving to be a nice ride. Takes some time to get used to all the new tech. Only quibble so far is infotainment controls are needlessly complicated and overly sensitive. They are a real pain, otherwise a good car. Sound system in the F Sport is amazingly good."
car_488,So frustrated :(,"In the beginning im so happy and proud to drive a one of the luxury car.  I bought second hand. But everything is falling apart of this car.  First smoke coming from my hood , then have a poor AC but was able to fixed it right away.  One day I was parked out my drive way and the sprinker kicked in with a high pressure of water due to sprinkler head blew off.  water went to my hood and the next thing I know it ruined my stereo speaker - very poor electrical wirings.  Then front passenger side window wont work - I had to just not to use it at all. followed by the back passenger door handle wont work and now I looked so stupid before I can get in my car I need to go at the passenger side to open my driver door handle.  What on earth!!! what else will be next ? :-/"
car_489,Drive train ok but POS vehicle on top of it.,"Drive train is good, but extremely expensive to maintain and has some very poor engineering designs.  Accessories are low quality, high rate of failure and expensive.  The electronics  have the worst programing logic and a high rate of failure.  It would be passible if you could put a real vehicle on top of the drive train.  Spent a lot of money for nothing."
car_490,2003 bmw x5.,"this is the worse car than I ever own , in just 6 month I do spend more than $ 4000 dollar on repair the ultimate pi-- on sh--t on the road , zero quality . over all , so expensive parts and mechanic labor , is fully madness."
car_491,An honest X5 review,"Took a chance buying a used 2003 X5 4.6 with about 80,000 miles. Have put about 12,000 miles on it so far. Not a commuter car. Best as a hot rod Sunday driver or on short drives to the lake towing 2 wave runners or a boat. Horrible stock radio. You'll want to replace the radio 'head unit' so factor in $500 to $1,000 for that if you DIY. Very nice seats. Fit and finish of interior for 2003 exceptional. Ride too harsh for most people (mainly due to the big 20"" wheels and low profile tires of the 4.6is). One thing critics overlook is that this machine was built to tow 6,000 pounds! So much torque and power. Quick 0-60. Snaps your head back in the seat, no problem. More than you will ever use. Could you take this car to 300K? Maybe, if you are gentle. I've heard the weak spot is the transmission. Don't abuse it and you should be okay. It's really a 2nd car for carving back roads on sunny days. It is a high performance car that just happens to be an SUV. I wouldn't beat it up commuting. There are better cars for that job. Oh... and did I mention this car can corner! You can definitely take this car to the track if you like. It can hang some serious turns. It really is an ultimate driving machine if you get it out on the twisties and cut loose. It's like two different cars. Around town it's a bit bumpy and overkill. But in the canyons it drives like a race car. Update 12/05/2017... Still have the car and it's still doing well. If you want to keep one of these long term there are a few maintenance items you will need to address. You can perform these fixes yourself if you have time and inclination; timing chain guides, valley pan, vanos, driveshaft spline. You can Google them and see what is involved. Also possibly gasket behind the water cooled alternator housing. Google them, see what is involved and see if you are up for it. Or, look for a car that's had some or all of these things done already. Not all of them need to be done right away. Just depends on the mileage and how the car was driven. There is also a cold weather oil separator issue fix but those in moderate climates don't need it."
car_492,bmw x5,"I await at least 30 commments about the this car being too heavy from the same folks to takeover any Camaro related thread whining about how they have to wait for the next gen car because the Camaro is 400lbs overweight. V8 powered coupes built on robust RWD platforms are not light- as evidences by the porky 4300lb curb weight of this 650i coupe.This is one of the best BMW i own, there is nothing i will change the only problem was the audio system but i was able to add an iPod interface made for Bmw AND PROBLEM SOLVE [non-permissible content removed]"
car_493,2003 BMW X5 3.0i,I have this car for 3 months now and I put about 3000 miles including a trip to Myrtle Beach. I enjoy driving this car. My wife loves it and my son wants to drive anywhere we take this car! So far so good. MPG about 20 highway around 17 in the city. I expected better! The only despoilment is the stereo and the fading of all the readout on the instrument panel. For a 50K + car when new is a disappointment! Other then that I very happy with the car. No problems so far other replacing the rear window regulator in the first week! Very easy to do and I was done in 20 min. Shop around for parts. You will find big difference in money. As a used car and paying only 1/4 of original price is GOOD!
car_494,Don't Buy X 5 maintenance nightmare,"Have spent over 3,000 replacing transfer case belts pumps cooling fan assembly battery pulley"
car_495,And they call it a truck,"I love my 03 X5.  I take care of it like a baby and it takes care of me.  I don't run up the mileage and relatively speaking it has.t cost too much to maintain.  When something begins to go wrong I fix it and this minimizes major repair costs.  I had a 4 year warranty and extended it 2 more years.  The first 4 year warranty was great but the second 2 year warranty not so good.  3 items I am disappointed with would be the stereo (although it is better than my premium Honda sound), the digital reading on the dash board are beginning to go away and when I roll down the back window(s) and drive over 30 mph, the sound is deafening.  Otherwise my BMW X5 runs like a top."
car_496,Mixed Review,"Bought used with 20,000 Miles,  Loved appearance inside and out.  Immediately noted the AM/FM reception in Northern Minnesota was the worst of my experience with over 30 vehicles.  Dealer denied there was a problem in 3 visits. Finally told me ""95% of owners don't listen to AM anyways"".  Communications with corporate BMW were very poor.  The person in NJ was experienced at deflecting complaints, but knew little about cars. Twice had engine problems under warranty where car blew black smoke out of exhaust. Now at 95,000 the dash displays are missing some digits and the fix is too expensive.  One Key Fob is dead and you can't fix yourself, wheels are corroded, dealer experience has been poor."
car_497,Bad vehicle,"Since I purchased this car it has had nothing but problems. The car has spent more time in the shop than in my garage. Every week is something wrong with this car. I have spent over 9k in repairs and that's not including what the extended warranty company has paid. I am very disappointed in BMW, this car is not the ultimate machine they make it to be."
car_498,Mixed bag,"Performance, appearance, gas mileage are all excellent. The interior trim is not holding up and the controls are terrible.  AM radio reception is terrible and the controls on the steering wheel are much too complicated in comparison to the Mercedes and Honda I drive.  Cruise Control has 4 buttons with symbols and must be actuated whenever you start the vehicle.  The sound system has no dial to go from stations only a button to advance.  I would never buy another BMW.  I'll stick to Mercedes and Hondas.  This is a fun to drive ride and it is a shame they let the little things get in the way of satisfaction for people like me."
car_499,Fun vs. Frustration,"I have owned trucks and SUVs all my life and I have yet to own one that is as much fun to drive as the X5.  You pass other drivers like they're in reverse and it corners and brakes like a BMW should. It's one of the best looking vehicles on the road and no matter how hard you push it, it wants more.  However, every other month another sensor or display light would go off or hose will leak or seal break and I'd get hit with another $500 bill (at a minimum) to fix something that just shouldn't go wrong (door locks, airbag light, etc.). It was always something.  If you have the patience and another vehicle to rely on, it's a great car. If it's your only car, check your roadside assistance."
car_500,No competition!,"My X5 4.4i is the best of 20 cars I have owned! It pulls my wakeboard boat with ease and looks great doing it. The cold weather pkg even finds it uses in the summer (heated seats on cold lake nights)! This SUV drives and rides like a car, any my friends with Tahoes and Armadas get jealous after driving it. Doesn't have the most storage in the back, but enough to take camping and haul the kids (and their stuff) around. It has been a pure pleasure to own and to drive. I look forward to upgrading to new 2007+ body style and the third row seat for the kids' friends. I have never met another X5 owner who did not love their car. So, go get one already. :)"
car_501,Teutonic titan,"My x5 has 75k on it.  I use it for working in 7 counties in norcal.  With the exception of a sometimes humorous glitch with the speaker telephone, it has not had one single repair except consumables.  The engine and transmission have performed flawlessly, and on the rare occasion that I have had it in really serious snow, it has been a panzer tank.  This is my 4th BMW, and I have had two Saabs, two Mercedes, a Volvo, a Trooper, and a Grand Cherokee--not counting beaters when I was a youngster.  Nothing is even close.  Fuel economy is great when compared to other v8 suvs.  The Grand Cherokee was an outhouse on wheels comparatively."
car_502,X5 4.6,"Fun to drive, very fast. Living in Boston where it is full of annoying potholes it is tough on the suspension. Year round Toyo Prox tires are the way to go! I am getting bored now so I am purchasing some Dinan products to enhance performance and sound."
car_503,X5 Boy!!!,"I bought my X5 as a certified Pre-Owned from my local BMW dealer. My X5 is my first BMW. I love the handling, acceleration and reliability. It is solid and safe on the road and at freeway speed. It has all the benifits that a brand new one would have. It comes with the 100,000 extended warranty and free maintenance service, so I pay nothing for all services. After the first three weeks of my purchase, I had problems with the lights in the dashboard and the transmission, so I took it for a free repair."
car_504,X5 Review from Kenya,"I love the vehicle. I imported from Singapore with 38000 Km on the odometer. I enjoy the car. However, I have experienced two problems that I have not been able to solve. One the radio/CD just went off whilst driving and havent been able to put it on since. Today I switched on the car and could not start, the computer display indicated code.  A few times the boot has refused to open, but it would later open after a day or so, seems to be an electronic problem  Can someone provide some solutions on this and share solutions if had experienced same thing.  Unfortunately I dont have a manual for the car"
car_505,2003 BMW X5,"Great car. Just normal wear and tear maintenenace issues.   Handling is great. Yes it's an SUV, not a Porsche.  Fuel economy is fine for what it is. Performance out of the 3.0 is all you would need unless you are towing."
car_506,Great  design - poor build quality,"My X5 (2003, 3.0L V6) has been great for the first 2 years, but then literally started to fall apart. During the next 2 years I had ~45 visits to the certified dealers to repair constantly failing electrical equipment. Locks, censors, numerous bulbs, dash board panel, electrical mirrors, alarm system are just a few of the problems that the car had during 2 year period. All repairs were covered by warranty, but the car spent more than 60 days in repair shop. Finally I got tired of constant problems and sold it."
car_507,Careful before you buy an X5 used!,"Bought new in 2003 and worked great when it was under warranty but everything went wrong when the car reached 50,000 miles this year.  Cooling system is leaking everywhere, power steering is leaking fluid at bushings, parking distance control often stops working, and much more.  It is a fun, comfortable SUV that is a blast to drive but compared to the last BMW we owned (a 1993 3 series) it is not very reliable ($5000+ in less than 10 weeks is unacceptable)."
car_508,Fine tuning your X5 is an Art,"Ride quality with a 3.0 W/Sport. Bouncing of the ride is extremely annoying for the passengers and driver at factory settings. The tire air settings on the driver's side door do not represent the dynamics air pressure has on this vehichle at all. I have 255/55r/18"" tires Michelin mxv M&S. Mileage was 13 mph to 18 at very best.  I looked on the sidewall of the tire and a pressure of 51 lbs. I put in 47 lbs of pressure on all 4 tires. Ride is incredibly smooth, over bumps smooth freeway. The extra pressure gives the SAV 20.8 mpg aggressive driving all day long. 26 MPG @ 60 MPH with cruise. Much faster, better cornering. The solution to bounce. Start at 51 go dn 37p"
car_509,BMW X5 3.0i,"The SUV is very nice. Very comfortable and easy to drive. I have owned since new. Good build quality, many nice features. Operation has been trouble free. Ride is slightly ""bouncy"" on bumpy roads. Performance of engine is fine. I would recommend it."
car_510,Truly Ultimate,"Flat out, the best all around sport-performance-luxury vehicle I've ever driven.  Despite minor problems with  the door mirror retractor motor and the dash computer display (both replaced under warranty), I am totally in love with this vehicle.  The honeymoon still goes on even after eight months of ownership."
car_511,x5 problems,"I had problems, after the first year, all the time and it was always in the shop.   Thank goodness for everything free. At different dealerships, couldnt keep it running. it was a lemon, and no one would do anything about it!   I got so mad on way to yet another appt,(over an hour, because of traffic, one way) I sold it (had bought it and not leased, didn't want to be stuck with it after expiring warrenty soon) and got a Z4, which I love and seems more reliable."
car_512,2003 X5,"After driving this car for 3 years, I was very happy with the dependability of the car.  No electrical problems and except for service, never needed repairs.  Only disappointment is lack of changes in style and interior from year to year."
car_513,A great used SUV bargain,"I purchased a 2003 X5 3.0 Sport for my wife last March with 41,000 miles and all options except for cold weather pkg.  In the 14000 miles since then we have received excellent service from the dealership and aside from replacing the OEM Michelin tires with Kuhmos and replacing the battery the vehicle has been flawless, safe, quiet, and rattle-free.  Insist on service records and if you can buy the extended maintenence package (3 year 50k including all services, oil changes, and brakes) for $1000 like we did you should be in the clear."
car_514,More Fun than Comfortable,"While I love driving my 4.6IS there are times that I wish I had bought the 4.4 in hopes that it would be a firm and sporty suspension without riding like a corvette (but it's great to be able to keep up with most sports cars).  The 4.6IS is incredible fun, awesome styling, and full of luxury.  My only criticism is that it doesn't ride as smooth as my Lexus LS400 I traded in for it (no surprise there).  I would buy another one tomorrow..."
car_515,2003 Used BMW X5,"Love this car.  had an Acura.  much more upscale. More Power. I miss XM radio.  Truck very responsive, quick,stable, safe.  Had it almost 3 months no issues."
car_516,2 years of Love,"We've had ours now of little over 2 years. WE LOVE IT. The look, the drive, the space, the feeling of power and safety It has been amazing in these tough NYC winters and the A/C is amazing in those hot & humid summers. I read complaints about fuel economy. I can't complain, the    X5 begs you to drive it fast. As I'm writing this we are expecting our first child. Guess what I'm driving him home in?  Need I say more?"
car_517,Surprising satisfying 3.0 inline 6,Overall a quality vehicle built in the USA!!!! The inline six engine's performance was a positive surprise against my expectations! It has been a very enjoyable experience owning this SUV! Did not know if I was going to regret not getting the 4.4 V8 at the beginning! turned out just fine.
car_518,"Sports Car Performance, Business Require","Want a car that takes you back to the muscle car power of the 60's, but with the comfort of a cadillac on long trips? Do you need a ride to comfortably take customers to sites both in urban and rural areas during all kinds of weather? Want the space to carry display items or large boxes for business? Do you have to travel 300 to 400 miles sometimes at night in unknown areas with little or no open gas stations because of the hour of your travel? Finally, do you want to have to use your cruise control because there is no way you can tell your speed without looking at the speedometer?If this sounds like a vehicle that fits your requirements, then the BMW X5 is for you. All class, all smiles."
car_519,Quality with performance,"Having owned numerous SUVs the X5 is by far the best from the standpoint of comfort, performance, handling, looks and just plain fine workmanship. I believe that in order to appreciate this vehicle, you have to love a car that feels and handles like a sports car. Mine has the sport suspension which would not satisfy the meek or the comfort seekers from a standpoint of ride. But when it comes to performsnce and sheer fun driving a SUV, this is the car to own. It's almost as much fun as driving my C5, but not quite as fast. I talked my brother into test driving one, and the next thing I know is he owns one after being a Ford Explorer driver for many years. I would highly recommend this vehicle."
car_520,X5,"I am very pleased with my X5.  I came 
from a new Tahoe Z71 which I was lucky 
to get 13 MPG.  The X5 is fun to drive 
and quite snappy.  We drive to Idaho 
in the summer and find the car very 
unique."
car_521,Superb!,Handles like a sports car.
car_522,JUST AWESOME,"This is the best car I have ever been 
in, owned, drove, etc."
car_523,X5 4.4,"Very safe.  Handles great.  Sucks gas, 
but worth it.  Built like a vault.  
Intuitive controls.  Agressive looks."
car_524,2003 3.0x5,"Has been extremely reliable with 
exceptional performance and handling.  
Typical BMW build quality and high fun

car_525,BMW X5 3L 4-27-04,"Purchasing, driving, and service have 
been the best I have ever had with a

car_526,Sports car in an SUV body,"This is a great vehicle.  Power and 
handling are superior. I owned sports 
cars prior to this car and this is as 
much fun to drive as they were, but 
with room for golf clubs, skiis, 
sports stuff, luggage, etc."
car_527,Exceeds my expectations,"Awkward ergonomics compared to 
Lexus...but that's no suprise.  
Superior handeling to any Lexus I've 
leased (LS 400, GS300 & SC430).  More 
solid build than Lexus.  As comfortable 
to drive as Lexus and Mercedes.  Most 
stylish and sophisticated SUV (Cayenne 
& Mercedes SUVs close 2nd).  Awkward & 
noisy A/C.  Worse-than-average SUV fuel 
consumption.  Amazing acceleration.  
Excellent sound system, although quirky 
controls.  DVD Nav is inferior to 
Lexus' DVD Nav.  Smaller cargo room 
doesn't bother me...and I'm an interior 
designer.  Always get compliments on 
its styling."
car_528,The BEST SAV not SUV,"I think so many people rate the x5 
inaccuratly do to is lack of off road 
abilities but it's on rad abilites out 
perform most passenger cars whenit 
come to saftey and driver control. I 
love my X5 and find it hard to imagine 
what I will purchase next if anything 
at all. I think more consumers should 
consider it even if cost is a major 
factor becouse you do get every dime 
that you pay for plus a few.  I 
would't trad it for the world well ok 
If I could get the no us version of 
the 4.6 I would but that is the only 
way.
Enjoy"
car_529,Seriously?,"Listen you're buying a 2001 BMW not a brand new one nor a used fairly new one like an 07 -14.. For 3500 dollars you're getting quality, luxury, awesome comfort, saftet, AWD which basically makes it worth 3500 just for it being an awd, the x5 3.0I run great, i bought one after i sold my 1988 corvette with modifications and a terrible interior. This 2001 BMW X5 puts my 2007 Lincoln Navigator in it's place it's that reliable and comfortable to drive. If the door handles are worth writing a complaint Youre wasting time not fixing an easy problem. Yes theres a few small problems here and there but I've never seen an SUV as loaded and well performed as this BMW X5.  I come from a classy NFL football family and have seen plenty of my share of luxury and sport cars as well as exotic and super cars, the best car Ive bought is a 2001x5 3.0i with 180k miles, i happily gave my fiance the keys to navigator that's how happy i am with this old thing. ***Also those who aren't tech savy or into the whole technology age this is the right vehicle to start out with because it literally has everything thats easy to learn without reading about. The horsepower differences are why I'm on here writing a positive comment about these X5's. Great gas mileage considering a 225 horsepower SUV. Lincoln Navigators get half the mpg city and highway compared to the x5's. The 2001s also accelerate when you need it to perform at those right times. They have front and rear sensors, also they have alarms at least mine came with them so maybe thats why the handles are causing trouble. It's really the neatest high end suv im proud to drive and talk highly about. I get so bored of cars in 2 months, but mine has been with me for 6 months and I dont want another suv. I already spent 3,000 grand on a few parts.  Give it a chance and see how right it feels it's worth fixing to me. Thank you BMW for making the most reliable SUV. Good luck everyone."
car_530,Not what I've expected,"When I bought this car, I was so excited till the driver door handle started giving problem. It will not open from outside. This was a continuous problem - every time we had to drive about 30 miles to get it fix and after 3 months we were back to the same problem. This is a fun car in the summer but comes winter and it becomes terrible even with winter tires. Lots of electrical problem - tail lights were always going off. No more am I going to buy a BMW x5....."
car_531,"Horrible Experience, I've only had it for 4 months","I've had the car for about 4 months and I've experienced all types of problems. 1- both the driver and passenger doors have problems with the handles. The passenger door doesn't open from the outside and the driver door doesn't open from the inside.2- The stabilizing system is ridiculously expensive to fix (about $800 depending on where you live)3- When shifting gears, you can hear loud rattling sounds. Don't buy this car!"
car_532,BMW...B.ite M.y W.ealth,"The moment I bought this vehicle I was very excited.Then the problems started.First the rack and pinion leaked all over my garage twice $2200then the front axles $400, then the ignition coils $800, then several sensors; from MAF to knock sensors $900 all within twenty thousand miles!Sold it at a huge loss...BMW should be embarrassed to have ever of put this on the market."
car_533,"Stay away, stay far away...","We bought this as an alternative to our minivan, thinking we would get the same quality from the X5 as our other BMWs. From the start we had problems. Within the first 3 months we replaced the oxygen sensor, max air flow regulator, thermostat, and lower control arms, along with what seemed like a half dozen sensors that keep going bad. Even the general maintenance costs are very high, as its costs $120 for an oil change (8 quarts premium synthetic) and 91 octane gas, performance brakes & tires, etc. We ended up selling this and taking a loss. Back in college I had a 1984 318i and later a 1995 325i convertible that were both extremely reliable. What happened BMW?"
car_534,2001 BMW X5,TMV FTOM 9.434
car_535,Horrible quality and workmanship,"We bought this used from a private party who was the second owner. All the maintenance and repairs were done by the dealership. It was welled cared for. All I can say, from day 1, it is a lemon.  We got for $1K less than private party price, but it is a LEMON.  The interior design is great, but the quality of items (door handles-sun shades-back tailgate-etc) feels like the cheap made in China toys that break the same day you open it.  This is our second BMW and thought it would be the same quality, our 2001 525i has never had any problems, just routine $65 synthetic oil changes, and normal brake replacements.  The X5 is horrible, DO NOT BUY ONE.  I should have just bought me a new Odyssey."
car_536,Disappointed,"6 months after purchase driver power window failed to operate, I was told poor design.  Broke again then pass.  Side front failed then pass. Rear failed.  Charged for last three.  At 65,000 miles right tail lights quit.  Bad socket.  Both front axles failed replaced.  Self leveling system failed.  Total cost over 5,000 usd.  At 77,000 ignition coil failed.  This car has never been off road,  regularly serviced and garage kept.  Currently at 95,000 miles have cooling problem  [ I think blown intake gasket ] and 1 maybe 2 more coils, driver window will not close again,  front fan inop,  and many dash digits out.  I say never buy 1st model year not even a BMW.  No to BMW of sa.  I have a lemon"
car_537,THE WORST SUV YOU WILL EVER BUY!!!,"I bought this SUV loved the design and it is a fun SUV to drive although the car is horrible. It has been in the shop for countless issues...which are major .. water pump went out had to be towed, radiator went out,  numerous sensors that won't go off even after going to the shop for repair, engine misses at low speeds, the car is very unreliable and I do not feel safe driving it. I will never own another BMW ever! Too costly and not enough reliability. Constant headache of what's going to happen next. I have a huge folder of all it's repairs...that is ridiculous considering what I paid for it. I am selling it tomorrow hopefully the warning lights will stay off until then. DON'T BUY!"
car_538,Best SUV ever!,"Definitely the best vehicle I ever had! No problems at all, just oil changes, brakes and tires. The engine's still strong and feels like it is still new."
car_539,I Missed Christmas twice. No Rent money,"I can't believe how great it is to drive... it's completely the best handling S.U.V. The day I got it the check engine light was on then the Trans went for a $4,000 job. The rear light fixture had to be replaced rusted. The oil pan drain bolt stripped & was replaced for $600. Alternator was $750. Window Relay was $300. Left-Front wheel bearing $381. Air hoses and M.A.F $854. Now to things I haven't got to yet. All Rear Upper & Lower Control Arms $2,200. Steering Shaft $800. Check Engine Light Still On & can't get Inspection. Already had a Fail-Pass Inspection & can't do it again. My shop gets mad when they see me because of the many problems. This X5 has messed up my life... be scared."

I keep thinking I want to go back to a 
car but then I drive it and I can't 
remember why. If your considering it I 
have one suggestion... DRIVE IT. I 
don't think you will buy anything

For me, no other SUV comes close. If I

car_544,Happy with X5,"We bought our X5 in anticipation of 
having our first child.  The ride is 
great, it's comfortable, and is well-
made through-out.  However, there are a 
lot of little convenience features

months and its survived a trip from
Texas to San Diego in comfort and
numerous off-road adventures.  I got the
premium package and the interior space
is nicer than my living room.  Although
I wanted a car that would do a
relatively good job off-roading,
interior finishes and on-road handling
were the most important to me and the
BMW X5 has that in spades."
car_550,Handling,"I enjoy the way it handles when 
driving. 

I was able to take the driving course 
at the manufacturing plant in 
Spartanburg, SC. What a great 
experience! I learned how to handle the 
car in many different situations. Off 
the road and On. 

Although I probably will never go off 
road with my car, that experience was a 
good taste of what I could expect and a 
good lesson on how to handle the 
various controls on my car."
car_551,i love this car,"handles like a sport car. safest car on 
the road, in my opinion. absolutely no 
wind noise,no feeling of speed even if 
you are driving 90 plus.design of body 
gives almost perfect protection from 
car doors of other vehs. huge brakes 
that stop you virtually on the 
proverbial dime. I had three 928 
porsches before this car and i would 
never go back. you look down and can 
really see all the other cars etc."
car_552,Bad Ass Toy,"This SAV is wonderful.  I looked at 
several other vehicles and decided on 
the X5.  Best choice I ever made.  The 
only problem is that I don't get to 
drive it much since my girlfriend is 
always taking it.  Forcing me to drive 
her RX300.  No comparison in 
vehicles.  If your going SUV go X5!!"
car_553,2002 BMW X5 3.0,"What a highway cruiser!  So quiet--
solid at high speeds.  I bought it 
because of the safety features and the 
ride.  I had a '95 525i that I sold 
when I left D.C. and bought the X5 
because I wanted the 5-series ride with 
full-time AWD.  ONLY regret is that I 
did not pay the $150 for the heated 
steering wheel--would have been a great 
addition to the heated seats."
car_554,Great fun to drive,"This is the third BWM I've owned, but 
the first X5. The X5 drives more like a 
sedan than a truck. It accelerates and 
coners great! A friend I took for a 
drive commented on how smooth it drove. 
He said he would be afraid if he owned 
one, he would get speeding tickets all 
the time because he wouldn't realize 
how fast he was driving. I considered 
buying the 4.6, but the salesman said 
I'd have to buy snow tires for the 
winter and I didn't feel I should have 
to do that for an SUV."
car_555,Best car I ever owned,"The best car I ever owned.  This SAV is 
a star - fun to drive, classy, and most 
important SAFE.  I have the sport 
version and the only thing i don't like 
is the fact the tires are different 
sizes and you cannot rotate them, so 
you must replace every 20k miles; they 
are very expensive tires too!

I'm going to drive it until its wheels 
fall off!!!"
car_556,BMW x5 3.0i loaded-quality problems,"Lots of mfg/assembly quality bugs.

rear lid pops opne when it rains/cold,
Doors freeze easily and you cant keep 
them closed when they do.

Poor handling in linited snow conditions

Vehicle doesn't always start on first 
turn of key(fails 7/10 times)

Power Windows fell off runners  had to 
have service fix them but they diod a 
poor kob at removing/reinstalling door 
panels

Alarm system goes off when it is hot out

Window shades break easily

Navigation system can only be shut down 
by shutting down the car. No SW control 
to turn off system.

Note I have spoken to at leastthree 
other owners and they have experienced 
95% of these same issues"
car_557,Allmost a 10,"I love this SAV. They could have made 
the cup holders bigger. Other than 
that it rocks. Get Sat. Radio too, i 
love it."
car_558,I love my car,"I have looked at many SUV's and the BMW 
X5 is elegant with balls."
car_559,BMW X5 review,"Outstanding value. No problems at all.  
Great support. Holds the road like a 
sports car."
car_560,Best SUV on the road,"The BMW X5 is the best looking SUV on 
the road.  It also performs and handles 
great and gets better gas mileage than 
I expected.  The interior is beautiful 
and just the right size for me, that is 
carrying light to moderate loads."
car_561,Great BMW,"I was never a big fan of BMW until now. 
My 2003 X5 is an excellent vehicle. It 
is fun to drive - it feels like a 
sports car but has much more room. The 
only draw-back is its capacity to carry 
any substantial payload."
car_562,THE BOMB,"THE BEST TRUCK MADE BAR NONE.  DRIVES 
LIKE A LUXURY SEDAN, AND IT FEELS LIKE 
A TANK"
car_563,damn good truck,"best truck ever. real nice. like 
colors. gas milage not to good."
car_564,The Ultimate X5,"Being a first time BMW owner, I now 
know why they call them the Ultimate 
Driving Machines.  This is the SUV that 
has everything I ever wished for;  
power, style, performance and value.  
It's dual exhaust system is music to 
the ears when you are cruising in the 
best interior in the industry.  It's 
truly worth the extra dollars!!!!!"
car_565,Why I picked the X5,"The reason I choose the X5 is the safty 
and looks. I love the interior of the 
car and the cruise the car gives me. It 
rides so smooth even with the sport 
package. It has so many options that my 
wife and I only went thru the first 20 
min on the DVD before we had overload 
on all the things it can do"
car_566,BMW 2003,"too many plastic parts in the trunk 
area that creats noises specailly in 
the cold weather.
should be littel lower than it is now.
tail gate should be lower and more 
accessable."
car_567,BMW X5,"This sleek SUV has to be the best 
vehicle in the world! It has a car-like 
ride, it's super fun to drive, it's so 
smooth on its wheels, and BMW is one of 
the safest cars! It has a top-notch 
navigation system, awesome sound, and 
an awesome engine! This SUV rocks!"
car_568,A Car You Can Trust,"The BMW X5 is a great SUV that you can 
depend on. It's not only comfortable 
and secure, but also incredibly fun to 
drive."
car_569,sportcar with suv advantages,"this vehicle is like driving a sportcar 
yet you can see above the traffic.
has more power than you'll ever need and
has class to go along."
car_570,i'm happy,"i love it and i can't wait to get 
another one for my wife"
car_571,BMW X5,BEST SUV I'VE EVER OWNED
car_572,X5 4.6: A Mix of Sport Utility & M Power,"This version of the X5 is truly an 
awesome blend of power and 
performance.  It drives like a sports 
car with a hard ride and razar sharp 
handling... The Standard 20"" rims and 
crome dual exhaust covers give a subtle 
hint to other drivers that this is no 
ordinary X5.  The dash is designed the 
same as the current M3 dash. If the 
feeling of leaving other drivers in the 
dust at a red light appeals to you this 
is the truck for you... but be warned.. 
expect plenty of visits to the pump.. 
It averages about 10mpg. It may not be 
for everyone, but those who appreciate 
the raw power (0-60 in about 6 secs) 
and incredible design will truly love 
owning one."
car_573,Cranking on the miles and loving it!,"Great vehicle -- let's not kid, does 
not ride like the BMW sedans, but it is 
the best ride (and performance) for 
it's class."
car_574,bmw  X5 the best,"THe X5 has made me extreamly happy, I 
like to just put on some tunes and down 
all the windown and jam out. The drive 
is lovley and i enjoy driving anywhere!"
car_575,4.6 il,"I purchased this vehicle after owning a 
4.4 for a few months.  I was very happy 
with the 4.4 but wanted the highest 
performance offered in the 4.6.  I am 
delighted with both, but the 4.6 is 
definitely worth the extra money.  
There is nothing to complain about--
it's a terrific machine!"
car_576,Awesome Truck,This is a great fast beautiful truck
car_577,BMW,It's te best SUV
car_578,i love my x5,"its an amazing ride. its safe, 
comfortable and its glued to the ground 
u never feel like when ur making a 
sharp turn its going to flip over on 
you. I defiently reccomend the x5 
especially if your in it for safety, 
along with looks and comfort."
car_579,BMW has a winner,"Very pleased with the performance for 
the size engine.  Spacious & 
comfortable including back seat 
passengers.  All the amenities of a 
luxury class vehicle."
car_580,"X5,4.4","have enjoyed my first BMW experience 
and service and look forward to more!"
car_581,Off-road capable,"As a previous Range Rover driver I find 
the X5 remarkably capable for most off-
road adventures.  The adjustable height 
option affords critical clearance for 
going through deep snow, sand and over 
rough terrain, but the four wheel drive 
has never not been up to task.  This is 
a remarkable vehicle as comfortable 
with traversing sand dunes, as getting 
through 10 inches of snow or nimbly 
navigating Boston traffic.  It's only 
limitation is cargo capacity, so be 
prepared to get a roof rack or trailer 
for the Utility part of SUV.  The 3.0 
provides more than ample performance 
while providing reasonable gas mileage."
car_582,THE BEST SUV,I LOVE MY BMW
car_583,Rides Like a Truck not a BMW Sedan,"It is quick, it is nimble, and 
functions very well in winter weather. 
It is not used for off-road, so not an 
issue for me. I like styling. I wanted 
a V-8 which narrowed my options. After 
my first long road trip on interstate 
highways where I felt every 
imperfection in the road, I decided my 
wife (who loves it) could have it. It 
is not a long trip luxury vehicle which 
is what it replaced."
car_584,best suv,"I've owned several SUV type vehicles 
and this is by far the best all around.
I've been able to travel anywhere 
without any problems whatsoever."
car_585,X5 all the way,best suv on the road
car_586,Best vehicle I have driven so far..,"I have owned this vehicle for a year 
now, and I can't praise it enough. I 
would like to step into the faster 
version next. Keep it up BMW!!! You 
have a definate future in the car 
industry..."
car_587,Best SUV,"This BMW X5 is the best SUV that I have 
ever owned and I have had 6 different
ones.  I will always drive a BMW in the
future."
car_588,fun to drive,"this suv has met my expectations and 
then some.. i love it  i have owned 
almost every brand on the market..i 
will always keep this model in the 
garage:) it has taken me fun 
places,from drivng in dc(horrid road 
conditons), to the north woods of 
minnesota pulling a boat.....and the 
fun continues...alot more ""open roads"" 
to explore!!!!!"
car_589,Fantastic,"Love it, always recommend it."
car_590,my review,this car is the best..
car_591,Love it,"When i first drove it, i just loved it, 
it was so easy to drive and just loved 
the look!"
car_592,best luxury suv ever,"this car is the best ever. the ride is 
so nice and comfortable. the entire car 
was made with excellance in mind and 
they definitely acheieved that."
car_593,Sheri,"I absolutely love my X5.  I have 
absolutely no problems with it at all.  
It is extremely comfortable.  It drives 
more like a car than an SUV."
car_594,The Best SAV overall !!!!,"Fun to drive.
Very response with sport package. Its 
German quality and handling of a BMW 
with a better view of the road. 
Interior is beautiful and its not to 
trendy whereas many new cars interior 
get boring after a while."
car_595,bmw,"its a beautiful performance suv i like 
it aot"
car_596,Fun & Great,"Great Performance , Fun Car, Nice Lines 
and Style"
car_597,BMW X5 3.0i,"Excellecent total driving experience.  
All the room of an SUV with the 
handling of a car (a BMW car!)."
car_598,Kevin's toy,"Very short, it's a great vehicle. Fun 
to drive and great on fuel. Rides like 
a car."
car_599,great sport sedan,every suv should drive like this
car_600,A Real Driver,"Get behind the wheel of this beauty and 
you'll never want to park. The steering 
is so tight and the handling so precise 
that you'll feel like you're ready for 
the track. The X5 is a thing of beauty 
from all angles, and the quality and 
rigidity are top notch. It's got all 
the handling qualities of a 5 series, 
but with better traction and a 
commanding view of the road."
car_601,good,Just a daily driver.
car_602,my baby,"This is the perfect suv. I live in Texas
where the suv is a must.This car may not
be as big as most of the other bully 
cars but she has the kick to get you
where you want to go .(ahead of the 
rest!)"
car_603,OSSOM,"GREAT CAR- VERY FUN TO DRIVE AND ZIP 
AROUND TOWN.  A FUN CAR TO DRIVE IN ON 
CURVY ROADS."
car_604,Trading Up,"After driving a 4.4i X5, I decided to 
trade up to the 4.6is.  I was 
always ""wowed"" by the 4.4i, but the 
4.6is with the 340 hp engine blew my 
socks off.  I think it's the best car 
I've every owned (this my 4th BMW, so 
that's saying alot!)

The interior design is very nice, and 
comfotable yet gripping ""sport"" seats.

The thing handles like a M5.  

And the wheels, oh the wheels, 20inch  
5 stars.  They make the car."
car_605,Awesome,"Just got my X5 4.4i.  Awesome vehicle.  
With a wonderful interior."
car_606,Has some problems,"I love driving the X5. I've actually 
had 2 of them and highly recommend 
paying up for the 4.4. I had major 
electrical problems with my first X5 
that the dealership couldn't fix. The 
second one (4.4) has been perfect. The 
X5 has been recalled more than most 
SUV's."
car_607,"2003 BMW X5, 4.4i","Just an awesome driving and ownership 
experience (first 4 years of 
maintenance are included!). The ride is 
amazing as is the zippy acceleration. 
The interior is what you would expect 
from a first class manufacturer. 
Excellent styling and craftsmanship. 
Just a joy to drive."
car_608,My truck,"Great vehicle.  I've owned Bravadas, 
Tahoes, Blazers, Jeep Grand Cherokee.  
This is the best.  Many comments from 
others--they want one!"
car_609,Does'nt need to get any better.,"The first thing I noticed about 
driving this vehicle is how safe and 
secure you feel. One needs to set the 
cruise control during hiway driving to 
keep it under 90 miles per hour without
realizing it! I like everything about 
it."
car_610,BMW X5,"I'VE OWNED MANY LUXURY VEHICLES FROM 
JAGUAR TO CADILLAC TO BMW AND I'LL TAKE 
THE BM'ER OVER ALL OF EM!
NOW THIS SUV IS EVERYTHING MY 5 SERIES 
WAS + ALL THE FEATURES OF A MID-SIZE 
SUV. CAN'T BEAT IT!"
car_611,Worst B-Day Present!,"I have had nothing but problems with 
this vehicle.  My folks bought my x5 
4.4i for my 21st b-day and boy was I 
up for a surprise.  2 weeks after 
driving the vehicle, my engine and 
electrical systems shutsdown while 
120km/h on the highway and having no 
control of the car.  Where I live 
there is is no actual BMW body shopy 
you have to send it to, the Acura 
Dealership. I have had nohting but 
complaints about this car, just 
recentley my brake linings have had to 
be replaced and i don't even live in 
the city. And again my engine cut 
off!  I end by telling you 
that in my experience BMW is purly a 
STATUS symbol."
car_612,MY X5,"I love BMW.  I love my X5 even more.  I 
love the speed, the comfort and the way 
it looks.  I look forward to buying the 
new 5 series."
car_613,Owner of X5,"Not sold as a pure off road vehicle but 
it will do all most average drivers 
want."
car_614,Xtremely Fun,"They made me an offer I could not 
refuse.  Redesign for 2004 
is blowing these out the door.  The 
4.4 is the only way to go unless you 
are just looking for a ""mommy 
mobile"".  Still, wish I had gone with 
the 4.6 but another $10K, ridiculous.  
A friend got the ML500, turned down my 
offer to race. The ML500 left him on 
the side of the road in Athens, GA 
with a busted radiator hose.  Brand 
new car.  I will not own a car that 
leaves me on the side of the road.  
Mercedes should be ashamed.  If you 
want a performance german car or SUV, 
buy BMW.  If you want a gimmicky pile 
of mush, buy a MB.  Our 4th BMW in 9 
years and they just keep getting 
better."
car_615,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"The BMW X5 is the first new car I have 
ever owned and I will never drive 
anything but a BMW.  The performance 
and handling of this luxury SUV makes 
it feel as if you are driving on clouds.
Once you have driven a BMW nothing else 
can hold a candle to this ultimate 
driving machine."
car_616,BMW,"No problems with this vehicle.  Rides 
and handles well.  Comfortable on long 
trips"
car_617,"My X5 is great, but...","I have had my X5 for over 1 year. I 
think it is great. The main negative 
comment is the fuel situation.  It 
pains me to fill up with high octane 
gas and the mileage is lousy.  Another 
issue I have is with the engine power.  
I have the 3.0 which is the smaller 
engine.  Once you get to cruising 
speed, the ride is incredible.  
However, off the line it feels like you 
are towing something.

Otherwise, once you get over the 
buyer's remorse of just having shelled 
out 2 years worth of college tuition on 
a vehicle, you will absolutely love the 
X5.  In addition, you will no longer 
have to look at all the other cars on 
the road to see what you want to buy 
next."
car_618,The Best Vehicle,"This is the best Vehicle I have evern 
owned including other BMW and MB cars.

By the way it does hawl very well if 
you know how to load it. All the stuff 
to add to my house and 20by 25 deck 
were hawled in my X5. If you have the 
guts to make it work for you and not be
just an other show vehicle, it can 
handle it.  Had a minor defectice Key 
reading chip when I first got it but 
that got replace and all has been a joy.

My wife say say "" if that think has has
the female anatomy, all male will never 
stay with their wives unle to have 
children.""  Very true my man, very 
true."
car_619,Revive the x5,"Driveability is excellent.  Build
quality is poor.  Too many options and
few standard features for the price. 
For a status vehicle it should live up
to it's name and save the owner so many
trips to the service dept."
car_620,Best SAV,"It's an SAV(SUV)that handles like a 
sport sedan"
car_621,BMW X5 3.0 Great Car,"Just bought it last week. Base model 
3.0 still has good power. Interior 
finish and materials are excellent. 
Interior is roomy (even the back power 
reclining seats), and very comfortable. 
The NAV system is much improved for 
2003. Its very easy to use. We almost 
bought the Vovlo XC90, but the dealers 
will not deal on price. Plus, the 
performance of the X5 is simply 
superior."
car_622,Upgrade the stereo!,"I've been a loyal BMW 3-series owner 
for 15 years.  Decided to get an X5.  
Love the car!  Drives alot like a 3-
series, and has that one-of-a-kind 
look.  Black, sand leather, automatic, 
premium, sports, and climate packages.  
The BIG MISTAKE I made was in not 
getting the upgraded stereo.  The 
standard stereo is AWFUL!  What was I 
thinking?  I can't believe BMW puts 
those lousy stereos in $48,000+ autos.  
Not sure what to do now...but I will 
have to upgrade...somehow.  Anybody got 
suggestions?"
car_623,Solid SUV,"When you shut the door, you will know 
your in a save vehicle.  The SUV sticks 
to the road and has incredible 
breaking."
car_624,THE GREAT X5,"I bought my X5 for my birthday lst 
year.  It is my first SUV and I am sooo 
pleased with it.  I have an Acura TL 
which has a smooth ride and was afraid 
that the SUV would ride rough. The X% 
rides just as smooth.  It's a fun car 
and whoever gets a chance to purchase 
one is lucky!"
car_625,Excellent Ride...Very fun to drive,"Fun SUV, great handling."
car_626,Awesome car,"This car is by far the best car 
(besides the 325ci) that I had and will 
continue to purchase BMW"
car_627,Best of Everything,"After owning a Range Rover, love it but 
it literally fell apart when the 
warranty was up,head gasket, fuel pump, 
big stuff, we owned 2 Toyota Land 
Cruisers which were wonderful, 
reliable, very low maintenance. It was 
now time for a ""fun"" car. So we ""scaled 
down"" sizewise, and purchased the BMW, 
after owning several over the years, 
the BMW reputation speaks for itself.We 
wanted the flexibility of an SUV, yet 
didn't want to drive a HUGE school-bus 
like SUV.
The only ""must have"" is the ""sport 
package"" the ride is like night and day 
compared to the car without it."
car_628,And its Built in the USA,"We own 2 X5's .  We have a Black 2002 
and a Silver 2001, both are the 3.0 
with automatic. The gas mileage on the 
highway is excellent. We drove from 
Detroit to the Georgia border on a tank 
of gas. It handles very good in the 
snow. We have owned 5 Ford Explorers 
over the years and there is no 
comparison. The interior is high 
quality and we get numerous compliments 
on the vehicles. The stereo system is 
excellent also."
car_629,X5 Forever,Great ride and drive!
car_630,My X5,Great car! Best car I ever had
car_631,X5 3.0,"It is hard to imagine how 225 HP pulls 
a 4,500 lb vehicle so sprightly.  
Handling is absolutely car-like, and 
certainly that of a very well-designed 
car. Interior comfort is excellent for 
four adults, and the various systems 
seem to mesh well together.  NO off 
road experience yet, but if you, like 
most of us, seldom venture off the 
pavement, this has to be the SUV for 
you!"
car_632,Central Ohio,"One of the best driving machines I've 
expereinced."
car_633,Best of the Category,"Traded in my '97 540i because I needed 
more space and awd.  The interior is 
very similar, but actually feels 
roomier than the 540 and for the first 
time in my life (in any car), my seat 
is not at the aft limit (I'm 6'2"").  
Tried the Discovery (rented for 7 
days) and wasn't impressed.  Test 
drove an XC90 - this would be my 
second choice as the price was almost 
the same."
car_634,8th BMW since 1980,"I have just over 2000 miles on my X5, 
and so far it's everything I expected 
and a little more. The horsepower is 
ideal and makes it fun to drive. This 
is my eighth BMW and I am just as 
satisfied as my first."
car_635,BMW,"This is the best SUV on the market.  
The ride is superior to all other SUV's

high side."

car_642,First Class,"A very comfortable, capable and 
attractive vehicle.  It does everything 
well.  If I could change it in any way, 
perhaps more room behind the rear seats

again...and I rarely buy the same 
vehicle twice!"
car_643,a practical suv...,"It is a pretty well known fact that 
probably 99% of people who own suv's 
dont go off road, and even if they 
wanted to, they would soon realize that 
there ""SUV"" was not really capable.  On 
the other hand, the X5 is a pratical 
suv, or a sporty van.  Vans are the 
ideal vehicle of america.  It carries 
kids, luggage, trash, new tvs, and 
whatever else.  It also offers the 
driver a higher seat.  Only problem 
though is the lack of beauty, styling 
and power.  The X gives you the 
practicality of van, in a sports cars 
body."
car_644,X5 4.4,"having owned a 97 montero, an ML430, a

fine for our uses.  We have a pac-a-
sport to afix to the roof for baggage, 
etc. for trips, etc.  We needed the pac-
a-sport when we owned our van as well, 
and in fact it was more difficult to 
pack up with a family of five with the 
van.  I feel my children can be no 
safer in any other vehicle on the 
market.  We have the nav. system in 
place and do wish we could use our c.d. 
system on the dash rather than placed 
in the trunk.    Not much negative 
input in my opinion."
car_646,i love my X5,"This is by far my favorite car I have 
ever owned. It manages to impress me 
everyday, if I ever get rid of mine it 
will only be to buy another one."
car_647,MV Review,"i have driven suburbans and navigators. 
This car tops them all!!! The only 
thing you give up in the seating space. 
The back is the same amount of space. 
Who wants to carpool anyways????"
car_648,Love my car!,"My 2nd SUV and I love it.  Drives like 
a car and has the BMW get up and go."
car_649,ALZ,"Easy to drive, comfortable, performs 
like a 5 series sedan."
car_650,A great SUV (SAV),"It is a great SAV.  I owned it for 
more than 3 years now, no problems 
with it at all, only 1 recall with it.
It is a fun veichle, I am very 
appreciate with it."
car_651,Satisfied,"After buying this car because of the 
crash tests results, it was aukward at 
first. But after a few weeks it quickly 
became ouf favorite car. The car is 
shurely a drivers car. The service has 
been excellent. The vehicle has taken 
our family abuse very well and shows no 
sign of fatigue."
car_652,Buy It.,"Buy it. There's no better SUV on the 
market."
car_653,VERY NICE BUT TO MUCH MONEY,"WELL THIS IS MY 2ND X5 AND I THINK THAT 
BMW HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH 
MAKING THE X I JUST THINK THAT THE CAR 
COULD BE A BIT MORE ROOMY AND MORE 
STANDARD FEATURES."
car_654,My X5,"I really love my X5.  It it really fun 
to drive.  I purchased it about 2 weeks 
ago.  I bought a Lincoln Aviator and 
traded it in within 2 weeks for the 
X5.  

Yesterday for some reason the battery 
was dead. I had to call Roadside 
Assistance to get it started.  I took 
it in to a BMW Service Center and was 
told that nothing was wrong with the 
battery. I hope this doesn't happen 
again or I'm going to start thinking 
that I made a mistake."
car_655,The Best Alternative To A Range Rover,"If you're in the market for a new SUV 
and you want something classy, swanky, 
and very fun to drive, but want to save 
bucks instead of getting a Range Rover, 
so you can afford a seven series, this 
is the way to go..."
car_656,Great Ride,"Best handling suv yet. Great power and 
brakes. Ride is on stiff side with 
sport suspension but perfect seats 
make up for it. Minor problem with CD 
flip cover otherwise perfect to date."
car_657,Good News and Bad News,"Handles like a dream, real performance 
vehicle. Gives you the pick up you need 
at stop lights and when you need to 
pass.  Interior center console is 
useless,does it ever occur to designers 
that people might have different uses 
for these?  Forget the cup holders, or 
at least allow me to remove them if I 
wish.  The manual AC is a mystery.  
There is no way to figure out the 
controls, something about blue dots and 
red dots and several little dials need 
to be lined up in some sort of order. 
Who knows."
car_658,Fun to Drive,"I have a 2001 4.4 and have thoroughly 
enjoyed this car but have had 
reliability and feature problems (mis-
marketing of towing feature, horrific 
cup holders...). The acceleration, 
braking and overall handling are 
similar to a sports car.  I describe 
the vehicle as an SUV sports car.  I 
tried out many SUV's and none compared 
in handling and power to the X5. We 
are sadly selling the X5 (see below).  
We bought an H2."
car_659,My First BMW...,"This is my first BMW, and fortunately 
for me it was an SUV, or rather an 
SAV. I've always wanted a BMW and I 
appreciate the flexibility an SUV 
offers you. Yet now that I finally own 
one, I'm not quite sure exactly how I 
feel about it--I just get mixed 
feelings. I love the sensation of 
owning a BMW. There's a distinct 
difference in the overall handling, 
performance, roominess, and comfort 
from my previous SUV-a '94 Nissan 
Pathfinder. Yet, perhaps I may have 
expected more than I received. I did 
not test-drive other luxury SUVs, and 
perhaps I should have. My only regret 
may be that I didn't get more options."
car_660,Excelent,I love this SAV
car_661,This truck sucks,"This car sucks...I live at the service 
center at the dealership."
car_662,my x5 3.0i,too new to say mush. good so far.
car_663,I love my X5,"We have had no complaints about his 
vehicle.   BMW went to great legnths to 
design a comfortable, fun to drive SAV."
car_664,Bmw is it really amazing?????,"this bmw x5 is really an oustanding 
suv. This is my first x5 that i have 
been irested in and i believe i made 
the right choice. Before i had about 5 
Jeep Grand Cherokee LImited and i 
always had problems with their 
reliability. The x5 has been outsanding 
on roads and i feel it is one of the 
most safest suv on the market today. 
The 6 cylinder drives like an 8 and i 
recommend this car to drivers who go 
upnorth or on high hills."
car_665,Highly Recommended,"I absolutely love this thing.  My X5 3.0
is exactly what the doctor ordered. 
Handles like a German sports sedan, no
SUV (this is not a car) tilt warning on
the visor.  If I drove my other SUV like
I drive the X5 I'd be wearing it as a
hat.  Sport package wheels give it a
great look.  Good amount of power, but
if you're a speed demon consider the
4.4.  It makes me feel great, like a
taylored jogging suit."
car_666,Great SUV,"Everything on the X5 has been beyond my 
expectations.  Only issues have been a 
couple of minor problems that were 
quickly taken care of by the dealer.
I would highly recommend this to any 
prospective buyer.
I can see why BMW is kicking Benz's 
rear end."
car_667,X5,"BMW made a whole bunch of ""goofs"" on 
thsi vehicle. The X5 only confortably 
seat 4, because the middle seat in the 
back has all of its comfort taken away 
by the petruding centercolsole in teh 
front. Still, trunk space is extremely 
limited."
car_668,"First 10,000 Miles","I've owned my X5 for six months now and 
put a lot of miles on it--thus far I've 
loved this car and it has had no 
problems whatsoever. It's fun to drive 
(a little too fun--you find yourself 
wanting to go faster than you should 
because you feel so safe, stable, and 
in control--One speeding ticket 
already). I recently drove a friend's 
brand new ML 350 and it couldn't 
compare...The BMW's seats were softer 
and more comfortable, the brakes felt 
much better, the acceleration more 
zippy."
car_669,X5 Best In Class,"Excellent sound, acceleration and 
status appeal.  Handling is 
outstanding, incredible cornering, 
never slides out of the turn line, 
sticks to the road.  AWD computer 
safety feature saved me from a crash, 
hydroplaned, and the computer took 
over, cut the engine and applied proper 
braking to straighten out the car.  I 
was so amazed, I called my wife to tell 
her the car saved me from the divider.  
This technology is awsome, check it out 
if you have snow conditions or on lose 
pavement, the car will correct itself.
Only tech problem was the rear door 
latch fires at will and results in open 
status.  Dealer said this was unusal 
and is scheduled for repair."
car_670,x5 review,"i have been so happy with this car.  It 
was definitly the best car that i ever 
purchased.  I can still have a durable 
suv that i can take anywhere and i know 
will have power, yet i also have the 
luxury suv that is perfect.  
also i always can rely on it because it 
is a bmw and they have always been the 
most reliable car in my vision"
car_671,great car,"this is the best car that i have ever 
had. It rides like a dream"
car_672,Love to drive it,"The vehicle is terrific - the Dealer 
service is a joke.  I've been to 3 
dealers in South Florida and they are 
all just terrible.  If you are looking 
for good service buy a Lexus.  If you 
want a fun to drive car, buy a BMW"
car_673,Exactly what you would expect from BMW,"As stylish as SUVs come, superlative 
handling, ferocious V8 acceleration, 
opulent yet understated interior.  BMW 
clearly sweated the details on the X5 -
 look at the quality of the dash 
plastics, of the shift knob, of the 
steering wheel, etc.  Mine can even be 
programmed to ventilate itself twice 
daily - no more leaving the office to 
enter a steaming car! Of course, you 
can always drop your foot on the gas 
and enjoy the 300+ ft-lbs of torque."
car_674,THE MOST COMPLETE VEHICLE.,"If you are looking for a sports car, 
luxury car, and an suv all in one.
I highly recommend the 4.6is.
It is a true beast with it's 
incredible high output 4.6 motor, 
however the exterior gives a sporty, 
yet elusive appearance, when compared 
to what this vehicle can really do.
The interior and overall ride is 2nd 
to none. 
I've driven most all cars and suv's 
out there , and the ride in this one 
is more like a ferrari combined with a 
rolls royce. 
Yet one feels like your are hi enough 
to look down upon the cars, but not to 
hi as to make you feel as if you are 
unstable or will flip when taking a 
fast turn.
At 100mph it feels like 40mph."
car_675,X5,"I have had my 3.0 X5 for 6 months, and 
had the ability to drive it under a 
number of different conditions.  
Handles well in the snow, and rain.  
Excellent dry pavment handling.  Motor 
is very flexible, and has 
sufficient ""kick"".  I have not driven 
it off road so no opinion regarding 
this.  Build quality was excellent.  
Buying experience excellent with local 
dealership"
car_676,NO MORE BMW'S,"3,5, AND NOW X-5 GUESS I AM NOT BMW GUY.
I LIKE A QUALITY PREMIUM AUTO WITH 
LITTLE HUB-BUB. NEXT SUV WILL BE VOLVO 
OR CADDY. WHERE IS THE 3RD SEAT."
car_677,THE BEST SUV,"iTS NOT SUV IN THE MARKET IN THIS 
MOMENT IS MORE FUN TO DRIVE.tHE X5 IS 
LIKE A CAR,NOT ONLY THAT ,ADD POWER 
STYLE AND SECURITY."
car_678,Great Car,"BMW engineers should be proud of the 
X5. They designed/built this vehicle at 
a platform where other car 
manufacturers would only dream of and 
of course try to copy after years of 
scracthing their heads. As an aerospace 
engineer, I think they have done a 
marvelous job in using sensor 
technology to enhance safety, handling 
and comfort. The multi link rear 
suspension is incredible for stability. 
Even the car key uses advanced 
technology for comfort and safety. 
Bravo to all Bimmer engineers!!!"
car_679,still needs work,"This is a fun car but it still has 
bugs.  Prepare for bi-monthly recalls.  
Quality is not up to German built 
vehicles (this model built in SC). Mine 
is constantly in the shop.  I'm selling 
it before the warranty expires."
car_680,Best vehicle I've ever owned,"This SAV has truly been a pleasure to 
own over the last 6 months.  I smile 
every time I drive it.  It has actually 
gotton more responsive and quicker!  
The interior is luxurious and the 
exterior is really sharp looking.  The 
handling in incredible. I am more 
impressed by the power from the 3.0 
liter I6 every day."
car_681,great sav,this is my 2nd bmw x5 love it
car_682,Best vehicle I have ever owned,"Vehicle drives like a dream,dealership 
is fantastic and performance is 
everything they said it would be.
Can't wait to get my next one."
car_683,A,"THE BEST SUV EVER BUILT.  IT HANDLES 
LIKE A DREAM.  NOTHING COMES CLOSE TO 
IT."
car_684,Happy New Owner,"I looked at a lot of the new 03 and 04 SUVs and only the BMW really had the performance on the road I was looking for. Having had 3 Grand Cherokee Ltds prior, the BMW is a great step forward and much better than the ML Class Chrylser/Benz tries to put you into."
car_685,BMW X5 4.4i Sport,"Excellent performance in all areas. 
Like the brakes a lot - progressive 
and nicely weighted. Steering has 
accurate feedback, even better from 
the seats themselves. Very fun to 
drive, with little body sway

The quality of the materials 
themselves and fit and finish is 
outstanding. i don't think quality and 
reliability is an issue. Just close 
the substantially heavy doors and 
listen.  I dont why some people say 
the quality isnt good....a find the 
car much tighter than a Toyata 
Landcruiser"
car_686,"Satisfied, not thrilled","The X5 was a fun SUV and I enjoyed it.  
I have no real complaints other than 
the god awful dashboard layout, hardly 
intuitive.  I just replaced it with a 
$3000 cheaper but better equipped ML55 
AMG Mercedes.  Both are identical in 
performance, so why spend the extra 
$3000?  It was a no hassle SUV that I 
thoroughly enjoyed though."
car_687,Outstanding vehicle!!!,"I Love it! Its every bit a sportscar, 
not a truck. Through the hills it 
carves the turns at 50mph like a BMW 
1/2 its size!! The 8 cylinder sounds 
like a million honeybees when you press 
the throttle. The interior is amazingly 
luxurious.  The seats are perfect. The 
Orange glow on the light wood is 
magical. There is only one thing you 
can say, Its a BMW. You will never want 
for more."
car_688,Fun to drive? Yes; Plenty of Problems? YES,"Bought this car new in 2001. Put about 25K miles a year on it, 50/50 highway/local. Great car to drive! BUT nothing but problems - windows stick; doors freeze in cold weather, try driving with your left hand holding the door closed because it won't lock, or try getting in on the passenger side and climbing over into the driver's seat. Then there's the engine - twice in very cold weather something went wrong with the oil exchanger/valve? Car makes loud noise then plumes of black smoke emerge from the exhaust, dash & front grille. The first time BMW took care of it out of warranty - this time we're waiting to hear. Should be a recall item."
car_689,Proud owner of an X5,"I LOVE this ""SAV."" It's my third BMW. After owning a 325i and than a 330i, I was very resistant on getting an suv, it all went away after driving it. I love the performance, and its only the 6 cylinder! It handles great, the exterior is beautiful, and it very reliable. This is WAY batter than Mercedes' ML class that I test drove. The best thing of all, after 120,000 miles, it still drives like I just drove off the lot."
car_690,Has its flaws,"I have always wanted a BMW and i recently bought my X5 this summer. I loved this car when I first bought it, but now it seems like its breaking my wallet. I put more money into maintaining this car and fixing dumb little problems than any car I have owned in the past. It seems like its always going to the shop, at minimal  once a month. So if you want a car with minimal maintenance and cheap to own, do not buy this vehicle. Not worth the money."
car_691,BMW X5,"Good looking exterior but very expensive to repair, great car before 60,000 miles after that it has been in the shop 3 times per year within 3 years I spend 11,000 dollars just in repairs."
car_692,The best SUV ever made,Don't buy another SUV until you check out the BMW x5. It's fast comfy and fun to drive. Its excellent on fuel. Good on long trips and is spacious. I am 6.5 feet tall and I fit in it fine. No problems with my BMW x5 3.0 yet
car_693,2001 X5 Lemon?,"I have had my 3.0 X5 since it was new and have had very many mechanical and electrical problems.  Replaced every window regulator at least once.  Cam shart position sensors replaced.  Eats brakes.  AC went out just as soon as the warranty was up.  Wiring harness had to be replaced because the engine would stall in turns.  Out of warranty repair even though BMW knew about the issue.  The paint is peeling in places the sun doesn't shine.  Not a joke, it is peeling between the doors, under the hood and in very, very strange places.  Another issue BMW knew about but did nothing to let anyone know.   I love it but can't afford it any longer. My next car???  Not a BMW!!"
car_694,"All I can say is ""Wow""!","Who knew an ""SAV"" could be so much fun.  The highway mpg with the 3.0 is fantastic--I've gotten 26 or better, which is most of my driving.  Around town drops it quite a bit, but still averaging 17-19 which is real world good.  Incredibly comfortable and feels totally safe.  My ""green"" girlfriend would rather take the BMW than her PC VW :)"
car_695,I'm In Love,"We just bought this BMW, which is our first jump from Volvo into any other vehicle in over 15 years.  We were blown away by the performance of the engine, the luxury of the interior and how an SUV (don't care if BMW calls it an SAV or not, it's still an SUV) actually handles like a car.  God willing, we're going to remain BMW owners for a long time.  We bought an extended warranty at the dealer, as we've read here at Edmunds that repairs can become an issue.  If you find a good used one like we did our pristine ""new"" x5, buy it. I'm blown away each time I get in the car at how well it's made.  Even down to the alarm key.  We loved BMW so much, we ran out and bought a 740i for the husband the next weekend."
car_696,Great Vehicle,I have a Carrera and I bought my X5 as a second car for more room for putting stuff in.   I absolutely love this car. The ride is a little firm and it is super fun to drive. The car feels heavy but the engine is more than powerful enough. The interior of the car is very roomy and the legroom for the front and rear passengers is huge.  The back has a very comfortable and wide bench seat. The car is a little stockier than most SUVs so the rear cargo is a little small but it has been more than enough for me.  I have had no mechanical issues since I purchased it 10 months ago. I highly recommend this vehicle.
car_697,My X5,"I have enjoyed this vehicle immensely since first day of ownership.  Had electronic-engine trouble at 50,000 miles which eventually required a $1500 repair.  Now have 90,000 miles with no additional problems.  Expect to own and drive for another 60,000.  Vehicle is extremely smooth and versatile."
car_698,Read before you buy,"I do not own this car any more. This was the car that made me switch brands for good. I am like most of you. I don't mind paying as long as I get my money's worth. I did not. Reliability is a big issue with me. I have had it until it went out of warranty, only owner, always kept up with the services, 11 pages of records from day one. Little things, dead battery, window regulators, Nav screen, abs sensors, vacuum leaks (intake manifold) MAF sensor, self leveling rear suspension sensors, A/C sensor, oil separator, among other things. Other than that, fun car to drive when not in shop. Well built, smooth engine but the fear of something going wrong anytime overshadows the driving experience."
car_699,First and Last,"What can I say, besides the typical maintenance which needs to be performed at 60k, this car is a tank. Lots of room, classy look and performance to please any driver. I've test driven MB, Infiniti, VW, Audi, and even GM. All seem nice but what BMW has done here, no one else has done. Handling is the first you will notice after you drive the rest. Then comes the power and performance this SUV has. You think that BMW states 290 hp. Think again. I've taken 540s with my eyes closed. Some people just underestimate this SUV. Get this car and do the problematic maintenance that it needs around 60k and you will never regret it."
car_700,BMW X5,"It's a cool car. I've had many SUVs before, and this X5 is best I've ever driven. Really sticks to the ground"
car_701,Love my X,"Had for almost two years, it's been a great car. Sporty and fun to drive, practical enough for trips to the home depot, yet comfortable and luxurious enough to take on long trips. Exterior looks great; interior is luxurious and comfortable.  The car has one problem; it will ruin most all other cars for you. You will get used to many of the bells and whistles found in this car that others don’t offer, for example the heated steering wheel, how did I ever live in Minnesota without it. Traction control and the all wheel drive make this a wonderful winter vehicle.  MPG 18 city 23 highway."
car_702,Good Commuter and Vacation SAV,"Got rid of a Jeep Liberty and couldn't be happier. Offers more interior room, vastly improved handling, and far better gas mileage - I get 25 on highway going 75-80.  Only problems encountered were bad rear brake light sockets and a bad sensor which were replaced under factory warranty.  Big pluses are safety features and ratings, interior room for 5 passengers (comfortably!), engine and braking performance, its exterior looks, and the legendary BMW driving experience (my 3rd BMW).  I found it a great compromise for both commuting to work and for family vacations. (I use a 20x60 trailer cargo box in the rear for extra luggage if needed, and it does not affect aerodynamics.)"
car_703,X5 3.0i as commuter car,"My requirements were simple:  safe, fun to drive, reliable, stylish, and able to both serve as a commuter car and tow my boat.  Answer:  A 2001 BMW X5 3.0i.  It's gotten safety awards, seats 5 comfortably, drives like a BMW, looks great, and both tows my boat and serves as my daily driver, averaging 19.2 MPG in Chicagoland traffic."
car_704,My X5,Excellent handling in corners and the best brakes I have ever experienced. Feels very nice when seated in it. A seemingly very safe passenger cabin. 3.0 liter engine is a bit under powered.
car_705,Lots of Repairs,"First, this truck was fun to drive. But......This truck needed dealer service about 20 times in three years, beginning the day I brought it home new. Battery discharged in the winter. Goofy electronics problems. Trailer towing was no problem for the drivetrain, but the subframe bent from the tongue load towing a trailer supposedly within the rated load. The cupholders would only hold one at a time due to the intersecting circles-- an aftermarket cupholder corrected this. Due to the frequent dealer visits and lack of confidence I wouldn't drive it to Canada or any remote places like I had intended...I bought a used Jeep for the trips far away from a BMW dealer."
car_706,The Best Value SUV Used. Nothing Better!,"I have had two 01 BMW x5 4,4's and I never had  any real issues with them. The first X5 was bought used at 49k and I had the lower control arms changed under warranty. I had it until 79k and nothing else but oil changes were done.  I sold it and bought the same model with 69k and every single option as the other was just a 4.4 with no extra options. I had to change the AC Climate control module. I did the repair in 15 minutes. At 78k just did front brakes and coolant flush.  I do not baby my vehicles and both x5's have held up very well in NYC.  If you want an SUV that handles and drives great, this is it!"
car_707,Perfect,"I've owned this BMW for about 5 yrs. I have 71k on it and nothing has gone wrong so far thank GOD. A lot of people complain about many different things but I think the problem is on how fully loaded you get it. There is a saying "" If you go German, then you go all the way"". I believe this because I've purchased only BMW my whole life and each time its been ""FULLY LOADED"" This means Sport, Premium, Winter package, and every other bell and whistle that goes with it. Try it, I did, and I love it...."
car_708,Dinan Package is a Blast!!,"Bought this X5 4.4 used, with 28K mi. and the Dinan package (throttle body, exhaust, 19"" rims, etc) from an AZ reseller. Whoever traded this truck in was nuts! This one's for keeps. Performance is BMW-esque, suspension firm, but not harsh, and handling outshines most sports cars. And the Dinan package puts it in a league of its own. A note of caution: max out on an extended warranty. It will pay for itself. They just don't make 'em like they used to. Speaker grilles fall off, cup holders fail to close, electronic gremlins that you just learn to live with. If you live in good terrain where the roads are long, you'll love it for all the right reasons."
car_709,THE X5 ROCKS!!!!!!,"We have a black on black x5 with every option 4.4L and we love it. The x5 has perfect crash scores, performance, technology, comfort, and a lot more. The x5 is the sportiest and best out of the bunch."
car_710,Bulletproof Bavarian,"The X5 is, by far, the best vehicle I have ever owned.  It still turns heads, runs like a top, and corners like it's on rails.  The only thing I can say that's bad about this vehicle is that the user interface on the navigation system is atrocious, and the CD changer is in the cargo area.  If I'm picking nits to this degree, you can see that I'm grasping at straws.  I wind up negotiating with my S.O. about who gets to drive it."
car_711,X5 Performance,I have had an excellent experience owning my third BMW.  The X5 has been great in performance as a sports SUV as well as a work horse SUV.  I consistantly tow a 3800lb boat and drive in the rockies.  The 3.0L has been reliable and trouble free.  It had a few recalls in '02 but they were fixed quickly.  Over all a 9.5 out of ten.
car_712,Judy's BMW,I bought the vehicle new in 2001 and ordered the special Mahogany metalic paint. My wife is the main driver and she loves it. It is powerful and agile and handles like a automobile. We have had a little problem with the electrical in the lights. The front side lamps and the back tail lights seem to have a problem. Other than that we are very satisfied.
car_713,Love My BMW,"This is the best car I have ever owned.  I love to drive it.  It goes so fast!  It makes me feel like a race car driver. It is beautiful too. The only thing I would change if given the chance is the lack of a drink holder.  There is one but it is really small.  It is right in the center, behind the gear shift. It has a lid and use that compartment for storage of loose change."
car_714,Love my X5!!,"I purchased a Certified Pre Owned X5, and I must say that I have only one regret.  This car does not have the cargo space that I would have really needed.  But the ride, the fuel efficiency, and the quality of the service that I receive when I go to the dealer has me hooked on BMW for life!"
car_715,Windows,"Looks great but I am having a problem with it. 3 of the 4 windows has already stoped working and fixed. The cooling system got all messed up on the highway. I have to get it towed. Water pump, radiator, hoses, builts etc were shot. It cost me over $1800. They are telling me that it has a problem of overheating....what..? It seems that my SUV is in the shop every month. I lost a confidence in the car. Any one having a problem like this or it was just my luck..?"
car_716,3 and out,Awesome car but it is time to go.  I have loved owning and driving the X5 4.4i but it is time to go.  After 3 yrs and 37m miles...I have a number of recurring problems.  I have been in the shop 6 times this year and i am currently waiting for another service apointment. The electrical system is horrible and I feel like I am always on the verge of the next disaster.  It is a wonderful car to drive...but I would wait until BMW gets a better grasp on the electrical problems.
car_717,BMW World,"I bought the bmw and was in love from the first time i rocketed away. The pick and top speed of (234 km/h) was great and this is the 3.0 liter. the braking is EXCELLENT and the turning great too! Overall you think you are in a sports car and the handling is stiff and reactionary. If you want a mean machine that can get you here to there in style and comfort then this is the year and the model to get , better on gas then the 4.4 and 4.6, 4.8 aswell.  Holds its price too!"
car_718,Great vehicle after 15K,"Bought it as a Certified Preowned with 25K on it.  It is the most desirable SUV in its class.  After several road trips with a baby, we like its safety features, ability to get places quickly and decent fuel mileage.  There are some electrical gremlins that I can not duplicate for the dealer that only happen 20% of the time."
car_719,MercedesML  Vs. BMW X5,"The best thing I ever did was trading 
my 2000 ML430 for an X5 3.0 liter. The 
ML is the WORST CAR I have ever owned, 
it spent more time in the shop than I 
drove it.  After owning the X5 for 
several months I have had not one 
problem with it.  It is the best 
driving SUV in its class.  Also it 
looks the best too.  Its like a tank 
driving in the rain and a 5 series on 
dry pavement.  The V6 BMW has more 
power than my V8 4.3 liter Mercedes. 
Oh yeah, it uses less gas than the ML 
as well.  I've already decided in 2005 
I will be leasing another one.  TRULY 
THE BEST SUV...."
car_720,X5 Review,"This vehicle will do anything that a 
SUV is suppose to do.  Its priced 
similar to the Chevy Tahoe and yet 
drives like a sports car.  I really 
like mine."
car_721,bucket list,"The car is great, little things are popping up that is annoying and have to take to dealership. The dealership does not give you an answer unless you bring it in the shop."
car_722,A Car Built for Disasters,"The BMW salesman took me for a wild test ride in a San Antonio flash flood that cinched the deal.  Then the car out jeeped the Jeeps in DC's Blizzard of '09, handling 12"" of unplowed snow without problems.  Then to top it off, I ended up driving through Nashville's flood of 2010 negotiating severely flooded roads and torrential rain with confidence.  Having a sharp car that turns heads is nice.  Having the same car survive two major natural disasters and keep motoring without a scratch is X3i.  My salesman said a Volvo survives a crash great but that this little X3i avoids a crash the best. He was right."
car_723,Just Amazing,"After trading in an Acura MDX, I went for the X3.  It is peppy, handles like all the other 3 series, hugs the road, has great pick-up and at 6'5"", I have plenty of room.  In the snow it behaves like a military tank, and on the freeway it secures the road with confidence.  I bought it as a second car, and I find myself driving it daily. It's cargo capacity is more than enough and it allows for organizing anything inside.  I have had absolutely no problems.  I thought initially it was pricey, and now, boy! I got my money's worth and then some."
car_724,The car-lover's SUV,"The X3 is awesome.    I have had the pleasure of owning a 325 (06), and a 328xi coupe (07).  I was afraid no SUV would bring that joy back but the X3 delivers."
car_725,2002 X5 with 26000 miles,"My third BMW.  The last was a 528i. The 
X5 3.0 offers BMW handling and ride 
with the attributes of an SUV.  Plenty 
of power, reasonable Highway mileage 
(20) no need for a larger engine.  I 
love it except for the seats being too 
hard and get uncomfortable over the 
long haul."
car_726,X5 review,"The X5 4.4i is fun to drive - handles 
very well, has excellent acceleration, 
looks great.  It also has a great 
sound system. Sometimes it is not as 
quiet as I would prefer."
car_727,Not Bad at all,"Just pick up mine, love it.  Of 
course, it is not like my old BMW 
saden....but it drive better than my 
old 92 Jeep Grand Cherakee.  I will 
buy another one.....if I have the $$$$."
car_728,WHat a fun!!!!!,"This is the best SUV out there. Fun, 
safe, reliable and great design."
car_729,My X5,"I sold a 2000 Mercedes SUV to buy this 
because I was disappointed with the 
Benz.  The BMW is a much better car in 
all respects.  The only negative is the 
single cupholder in the front."
car_730,Other SUVs should make one too..,"The best performance I have had in an
SUV, have had a Suburban, loved that,
had a Chrysler ML, hated it!, but now
this is brand new, and the best one out
there. Gas mileage not the best, but
then with SUVs I have become accustomed
to that fact. Other than that, the best
fit/finish, the most masculine looking
yet highest style out of all. Definitely
not a minivan trying to be an SUV.
Wouldn't even consider anything else now
as a replacement when it's time for a
new car."
car_731,X5: Fun to drive to the shop!,"X5 drives like a dream!  The 4.4 that 
we own has excellent responsivness on 
the road, no body roll [unlike other 
vehicles in SUV category].  Switching 
to Sports allowed me to zoom to 120 mph 
without the car straining.  Truly 
excellent BMW-like performance.  
Unfortunately... the car was built in 
the US and it shows: trunk light poped-
out, sun shades hooks broke, two 
recalls, auto-level computer failed, 
GPS had navigational bugs, etc.  
Nothing critical but annoying and time-
consumming.  Great, safe, fun car to 
drive but it was rushed out the door 
and the ""little things"" were not built 
to BMW-appropriate level."
car_732,not a reliable vehicle,"A very disappointing vehicle.  Our X5 
is in the shop an average of every six 
weeks for various problems.  It has 
been recalled several times.  The 
interior door handle finish is peeling 
off on all four handles (supposedly, 
this is ""normal"" wear and tear - sure, 
if this were a ten year old car!).  The 
steering wheel makes a horrible 
grinding noise in cold weather (three 
visits, not fixed - a piece fell out 
recently).  The latest problem - the 
seal on the sunroof is starting to fail.

This vehicle is not up to usual BMW 
standards.  We are getting rid of it 
this week."
car_733,Probably the Best SUV on the market,"the BMW X5 has got to be the best SUV 
out there. It has all the elements of 
a fast sporrts car , but still retains 
muscle in a SUV. The X5 can grabs 
turns and sails on smoothly. It brakes 
are just the same. It stops extremely 
well with a minimal amount of 
pressure. Ohhh, and theres the ever so 
popular speed factor, and man can this 
SUV fly. Stomp your feet on the gas 
and hold on because yor back is 
smashed into the chair. Not that 
that's bad because the chairs are very 
comfortable. The interior is very 
elegant unlike many other Suvs."
car_734,U-G-L-Y!!!,"My husband *made* me test drive this 
car because of it's reputation, quality 
and prestige.  I'll admit, it drives 
like a dream.  But I cannot see myself 
driving something so ugly!  The car 
reminds me of one of those old vacuum 
cleaners with the hose attachment.  The 
front end looks nice, but I hate 
getting stuck behind one on the road, 
the ass end is so ugly!  If it was 
prettier, I would've definitely bought 
it.  Bought a GORGEOUS (and less 
expensive, and American made) metallic 
red Lincoln Aviator instead."
car_735,BMW X5 3.0i,"Beautiful car. Really fun to drive. 
Larger than expected. Outstanding 
handling. Comfortable seating."
car_736,I love It!!!,"I love this car.  I (fortunately) just 
sold my 98 ML320 and the difference 
between the X5 and the ML is 
unbelievable."
car_737,Too bad . . . . . . . .,"I loved my X5 and purchased with all
available options including the Nav system.
Loved to drive, loved the look, but
many, many quality problems.  Had it in
the shop 13 times for numerous problems.
 Traded for a Toyota Highlander and glad
I did.  Feel I came down a notch as far
as looks and loved the feel of the
bemer, however too inconvenient taking
it for service every month.  Need
dependability and found it in the
Highlander."
car_738,"Unreliable $60,000 SUV","Reliability has been less then 
stellar. Numerous warranty issues and 
road side assistance questions quality 
control. The car is fun to drive and 
can be nicely equipped at a price. A 
base $40,000 car soon goes to close to 
$60,000. For that kind of money I 
expect more."
car_739,Love this SUV,"This SUV doesn't ride like a SUV. It 
has a comfortable ride.  We have a few 
different friends with different SUV's 
and they all agree ours rides the best 
and also has great pick-up.  It is 
manuverable.  We only had one minor 
problem in the past 8 months with it.  
The rear window arm broke and we had 
it replaced.  Other than that, it's 
been great."
car_740,Went from 2000 Z-3 Coupe to 2003 X5,"I've been a BMW fan for about 20 
years! This X5 has all the comforts of 
a luxury car yet the zip of a sports 
car! Got about every extra except the 
V8. Love the heated steering wheel. The 
cheapest thrill in years. The GPS isn't 
as good as my 2002 Lexus but I would 
never buy another car without a GPS. 
Your never ever need another travel map 
once you get the hang of them.
       My first BMW had about 300,000 
miles on it when a 1 Ton PU ran a stop 
light & Totaled it. (Not Me) I'll live 
by the sword (BMW) from now on!"
car_741,My Favorite SUV,"I love this car.  When I first saw it I 
knew it was love at first sight.  It 
drives like a dream.  It was a little 
pricey but it was worth it.  I would 
recommend this car to anyone."
car_742,Would Be Great But....,"This vehicle is unsafe. My brake pedal 
fell completely off. Fortunately I was 
in a parking lot when it happened with 
my family in the car. No one was 
injured. The driver side window decided 
tt break on a trip. Had to drive the 
car with the window down. Window fell 
out while driving. I have a 2000 4.4. 
This vehicle needs more testing & 
quality control. Have lost confidence 
in the vehicle! Fotunately the 
dealership I purchased the car from is 
top notch! I think they need to be. 
They see me too much."
car_743,Smooth Operator,"Drove the ML320 for a year and not vey 
happy with the driving. The car is 
reliable but not as smooth as my 
previous 5 series (528i). Thought I 
should try Mercedes but not completely 
happy. So I traded in for the 4.4 X5 
and so far it did not disappoint. The 
car is so smooth and yet so solid. 
Driving it is sheer joy and I look 
forward to many yeras of great motoring."

recomend this Car."
car_749,Not impressed AT ALL,"I sure hope people read my review 
before they think on buying the BMW 
SUV.  Yes, I bought it for the name 
and I am really regretting it.  For 
the money, it surely isn't worth it.  
It was MUCH louder inside than my Ford 
pickup truck and the performance is 
adequate.  I must say...before you buy 
or lease the BMW, PLEASE take it from 
me and look at the GMC Denali...there 
is so much more you will get for your 
money...the performance alone on the 
Denali blows away the BMW as well as

miles.  It is my 5th BMW.  Even 
measured against previous cars I've 
owned like an M3 and a 540i, this is 
simply the best vehicle I've ever 
purchased. It has EVERYTHING - 
performance, luxury, roominess, all 
weather capability (stable and 
tenaciously grippy on wet roads - you 
have to drive it in the rain to 
believe it), goes anywhere anytime in 
any conditions. I've heard all the 
reliability complaints and maybe I'll 
have some problems down the road but 
so far, it's absolutely problem free - 
not a rattle or squeak.  The build 
quality is so far beyond anything else 
out there it's just ridiculous."
car_754,X5 3.0,"The X5 3.0 is the best sport utility for
the $40-$45K range.  Fit and finish are top

drive."
car_758,What a disappointment.,"After several luxury SUV's from other 
manufacturers I thought I would try the 
BMW.  What a mistake that was.  At 
first the X5 was a joy to drive.  Now 
that I have owned it for several months 
it is in the shop more than on the 
road.  The fact that it has incurreds 
some problems that needed fixing 
doesn't upset me.  It is the pitiful 
attitude and lack of understanding from 
the service department that I have 
trouble with."
car_759,Best luxury SUV on the market today...,"Absolutely tops in build quality and

car_767,Great car for a family.,I love this car for hauling my kids around. Things just happen a lot and needs repairs frequently. Either have a hubby that can do the work or a warranty or a big wallet.
car_768,Bmw X5 3.0 Reliable and Strong like a Tank,"I own 2006 Bmw X5 with 160k+ miles. This is my 3rd Bmw (2004 325xi, 2004 330ci coupe) Previous owner of this car already own 4 more Bmws for entire family and taken care of this car like baby. I have had happen to read so many reviews on Bmw x5, but I feel  some small issues like door handle/coolant tank/Window regulators etc are do it your self or don't cost much compared to Engine/Transmission/steering/ sliding doors/tires burring out sooner etc  issues which other makes like Toyota/Honda/Nissan etc has. Small body parts/plastic part  issues in Bmw will not force any one to leave the car eating dust. In the past I owned Toyota's and Honda, and always driving on long drives 1200+ miles I was always in doubt when transmission would fail, that doesn't mean they are not reliable, but they are plagued by other major issues as well . Now that I am driving Bmw I at least have peace of mind I will reach home safe. X5 is like tank heavy build and strong body. I will suggest ppl before assuming Bmw's are not reliable, please go and read reviews on other makes of Japanese/American brands, many more issues engine/transmission etc. I always have smile on my face while in Bmw X5 for ride and engine sound, not the worries of Engine/transmission/steering issues might pop up."
car_769,terrible never buy.,I recently bought this car. Engine service soon light make me crazy. Spend more than 3000$Still light on.crazy maintenance cost. Never recommend.
car_770,Only paid $4500 for it,Its been 11 months since I bought my 06 X5 and it hasn't given me much trouble at all. I loved how it handled the nearly 30 inches of snow NY got earlier this year the AWD is excellent. Im thinking about purchasing a newer X5 soon. My advice to others is still the same... DO NOT purchase this car from a dealer (unless your buying a new one)Buying from a private seller is your best option because used car dealer lots are notoriously greedy and you dont know how long that X5s been sitting there
car_771,AN INEXPENSIVE WAY TO LUXURY AND FUN!!!!,"I purchased my BMW X5 6 speed with 94K miles on her. She's a 9 out of 10. The truck has every possible option. Navigation is simple to use, the heated seats keep my back relaxed, the tight steering is awesome, the gear box is smooth and easy, and the truck rides like a dream. This is hands down the best SUV I have ever owned, and will look for another one real soon to store away for future use, which I will use, once I drive the doors off this baby I'm in now.............If you want an incredibly fun SUV to drive; a 2004, 2005, or 2006  BMW X5 is your truck. But a MANUAL transmission is the ONLY way to go. They're hard to find. But once you do your research and acquire one, you will not look back. And 23 miles per gallon doesn't hurt either. HAPPY HUNTING!!!"
car_772,Where i went wrong,Bought a 06 Bmw x5 6months ago  within the first two weeks i knew where i went wrong BOUGHT A BMWHere's the thing about it Yes it runs rides and handles awesome but that doesn't make up for the lemon it isWithin  the first two weeks the mirrors started going crazy then the rear wiper wouldn't stop honestly it ran until it stripped the splines the headliner started falling and when i push nearly any button on the dash as soon as i lift my finger the buttons fly off at me then the driver window fell next the passenger fell followed by the right rear im like lmao $13k just thrown away not to mention burning a quart of oil every 1k miles As far as traveling yeah i trust it but im worried about the electrical system but who knows what part Will [non-permissible content removed] nextBy the way FOR SELL $8KMy loss your gain
car_773,Beware the 4.4i N62 engine- known issues,"The N62 (X5 4.4) is notorious for a valve stem deal issue which is a $4000 repair. For more evidence search ""X5 white smoke cloud."" This happens around 130000 miles, which I just reached. Avoid this model at all costs, and stick with the 6 cylinder which is a much more reliable vehicle. Such a shame and a waste of money in my case. The car is awesome with the exception of this fatal flaw."
car_774,Do not buy,"BMW X5 is an excellent SUV... when it's new.  When it gets older, it's got all sorts of problems, both big and small.  AVOID this vehicle.  Problems include cooling system leak and airbag sensor (below driver's seat) that failed and which may (or may not) prevent airbag from deploying during accident.  Repairs are very expensive."
car_775,Unreliable and horrific repair costs.,"I certainly get the fun to drive and German engineering concept.  It is.  Other than that, the experience has been nothing short of pathetic.  I just don't know how BMW can build a car this poorly.  Read the blogs because there is so much common ground with what you can expect.  Fan clutch, gasket failure, window regulators, taillight failure, door handles, , etc...  It just never stops.  To make matters worse, BMW built this car for 6 years and never addressed these problems.  I will never take this car on a trip for fear that Ill be stranded and stuck paying thousands to get it running.  Cant wait to unload it. Bad company and bad car.  Don't buy."
car_776,BMW lover no more,I owned a 328is which was a truly great car.This led me to believe that buying a used 2006 X5 4.4i with very low mileage was a safe bet.Wrong.We have owned it for 18 months - and had non-stop troubles - expense - and time wasted at the shop.The latest - It has taken BMW 8 months and 5 trips to the dealer to determine what is causing the coolant leak we have.We still aren't 100% sure - but now they think the heads will need to be replaced - or perhaps the entire engine.$25K wasted on this vehicle. I'll never buy BMW again.The ultimate driving machine - for driving to the shop.
car_777,[non-permissible content removed],"This car is amazing, when it works. It's beautiful, sounds great, fast, has a ton of features, but if its over 100k miles prepare to repair, paying all along the way. Since I've bought this mean machine, I've had to fix it, not once, not twice, not thrice, but EVERY week since I bought it (I've had it six months.)Every week, like German clockwork (if the clocks were designed to break) I've had to build and rebuild this car. Head gasket, exterior door handle, side lights, interior door handle, head lights, cv joints, alternator bracket gasket (didn't even know there was such a thing) window regulator, just so many things one thing right after another. Don't buy one without a warranty"
car_778,very intriguing sav,"I purchased it exactly 15 months ago as a cpo with the 6yr/100k warranty but hardly ever needed it during the 30k i put on it. very few things have gone wrong like a minor rattle from the engine bay turning out to be a/c fan plastic clips and failed driver side window switch after i left it open in rain by mistake (my fault). dealer fixed both, no questions asked. other than that, its been excellent & trouble free and i've taken it on numerous long trips since i owned it. the interior comfort and materials fit & finish is top notch and exterior looks good too. I've the 3.0i which has excellent low end torque (take off) but OK highway torque (you need to step up to the bigger v8s for better)"
car_779,Bought Used,"This is my second BMW and my first second hand car. I was worried about the reliability of the X5 but it's been two years, 44,000 km and the car has been solid. I love the V8 in this bad boy. I just want anyone that may be second guessing about the reliability of the X5 to just go out and get it! No disappointments! I get great mileage on the car, around 600-650 km a tank. I drive about 65% HWY and 35% city."
car_780,BMW X5 Rocks!,This is my first BMW and after 3 months of research I bought this used X5 with almost all bells and whistles.  Lot of heads turn when you drive around the town.  The ride is phenomenal and feel the comfort immediately.  Excellent safety features and you can see it immediately when you open the door which is HEAVY with plenty of steel bars inside.  Though its a SUV it rides like a car and the performance is awesome and never felt this on any other SUV like ML or Lexus.  BMW is a BMW and its King on the road!
car_781,Pleasure to drive,"This is my 3rd BMW and my favorite. (also have a 318 and 540)This SAV handles like a dream, the rumble of the awesome 4.8 L is amazing to hear. And talk about fast, my 540 is fast it has a 4.4, but this thing is neck breaking quick! The tires on this thing are monsters, very intense looking, the interior is roomy and very comfy and well appointed, I just love this vehicle! I like the clam shell hatch, it is more functional then I thought it would be. The radio is fantastic, I find the on board computer/navigation easy to use, don't know why some people complain they must not be very smart! I have the LeMans blue, it is beautiful! If you want speed, beauty, comfort, and great handling, buy one!"
car_782,Muscle Car SUV,"My X5 4.8is truly combines luxury and sport. This car sounds like a Porsche 911 on the outside and like a Bentley on the inside. I don't need it for commuting so it gets to sleep in the garage most of the week. But when it is time to play, it is rested and ready. It hugs you and the road nicely. Although I have loved the X5 look for years, I never thought the 3.0 had enough kick so 355 hp was the perfect remedy. I'm not using it off- road but it will tow some toys. With 4 years and 45k miles I went ahead and purchased a 60 month 60k mile (additional)B-2-B warranty for $3k as I have heard that some of the regular repairs can get costly."
car_783,The first of many!,"This is my first BMW and I LOVE IT! It's tight handling and turning radius are superior to even the sports car I previously owned. The ride is smooth and it has plenty of get-up and go! It has just enough space, not too much, not to little and I love the winter package. The heated seats and stearing wheel are amazing. I do not have the in dash navigation, which I prefer as my CD player is in the dash. The in dash display does still have many of the monitoring features, such as the ave gas mpg, distance/time trip settings, etc. Clean lines and great handling! I will always have a BMW!"
car_784,My Baby,"I have had the car since new. It comes with Premium, Sport, Rear Climate Packages. It is a 10/05 production. I have enjoyed the premium package with the great leather and the rear shades are great! But the sport package is great when on smooth roads only when on rough roads, it gets a little bumpy. But nonetheless, I do like the self leveling suspension and air shocks that come with that. I have not had to fix anything just regular oil changes all covered under warranty, for the first four years. Now it is out of warranty and had to replace the thermostat. Not too bad knock on wood. But overall I love driving it!"
car_785,BMW 2006 X5,Best vehicle that I have ever owned.  We now have 2 BMW's.  Very reliable and great in any weather.
car_786,No regrets so far...,"Got a great deal on an '06 X5 and took the plunge purchasing my first BMW. It's amazing how smooth and quiet the vehicle is at highway speeds compared to the Ford Explorer and Jeep Cherokee I owned previously. Granted, the tires probably have a lot to do with that, but engine and wind noise are way lower too. Love the grunt that the 3.0 inline six delivers--it loves to rev!!  I was a little concerned about the gas mileage, but it's been a big improvement over the Explorer, getting 23 or 24 mpg for pure highway driving. Premium unleaded can get a bit expensive when prices are up and synthetic oil drives up the cost of oil changes, but so far I'm dealing with it and loving the way it drives!"
car_787,The best car yet...,"Recently purchase CPO with only 28K on it.  Absolutely love it.  You can't beat BMW CPO - they had the car ready in mint condition, the warranty is excellent, and I still have over 20K left on included maintenance and 0.9% financing (unheard of for CPO!).  The X5 handles like a dream and I personally think this model is better looking than the redesign in 2007. The interior is top notch and the power seems way stronger than the HP rating -  that speaks to great engineering. No rattles, solid like a tank.  I'm actually getting up to 26mpg on highway trips and 18mpg average overall."
car_788,2006 BMW X5 4.4 CPO,"This X5 has been great so far.  Had 26,500 miles on it fully loaded. Absolutely pristine condition inside and out.  Excellent driving on winding roads and certainly plenty of power for the freeways.  Gas mileage could be better so still getting used to that.  Only design flaw I find is the Navigation unit and its location for glare and the cup holders.  Both were rectified in the 2007 but getting this for $35K I consider a good deal versus pricing of new models."
car_789,2006 X5 4.4,"Leased the beast for 36mo with 3 months remaining. Prior SUV was the Infiniti FX45...X5 is superior in all aspects. No pops, leaks, squeaks or rattles...not one repair. Still drives like new. A perfect all around SUV that performed very well on our icy mountain roads. Average 18mpg. I hope to buyout this X5 at lease end."
car_790,Great Ride,"This is our second BMW, the first was a 328xi, and although this doesn't have the same get up and go it definitely drives better than any other SUV on the market."
car_791,Everything BMW does well and poorly,"I have had the following items serviced since I have owned the vehicle - valley pan, panoramic moonroof, and AC headunit.  All items were covered under warranty.  The interior personal space is extremely generous.  The door openings are large and make getting small children in and out of car seats very easy.  Rear cargo area is somewhat limited as a result however.  I do like the clamshell hatch.  Driving this vehicle is so much fun.  It handles like a sedan and has plenty of power.  It puts a smile on my face every time I get in.  The styling is timeless, subtle but distinctive, I love it.  The CPO warty, extd service, BMW 2 payments, and 0.9% financing made this a very attractive purchase."
car_792,My third BMW and still loving them,I have not found another vehicle that matches the BMW standards and driving comfort. I have driven vehicles from most brand names on the market. I have compared all features with a lot of disappointments. I still have found very little disappointment in BMW. Those that complain have to completed there homework. Once you drive one its hard to drive anything else.
car_793,Wish i can return it!,"It's my first BMW, i was excited at first to drive it but when it reached its 38,000 miles it gave me a lot of trouble, engine wouldn't start at all. Dealer changed the alternator and battery. Every time I drive this car I'm nervous because it might cause trouble again. NO DOUBT it happened again today after 5 months with 43,000 miles, the car stop at the road during winter time while I'm driving, unable to start it, tried multiple times, battery is totally dead and it has to be towed again in the dealership. This is my only car and I used it for work, I'm totally upset about its inconvenience! I wish I can return this car to BMW, it's a lemon car!"
car_794,"Awesome ""SAV""","This is my first BMW and I love every bit of it, now I know why BMW is called the Ultimate Driving Machine. The styling is pure BMW. The ride is smooth as silk, the seats are comfortable, and the overall quality is outstanding. My only dislike is the CD changer located in the rear due to the optional navigation system. Something prospective buyers need to keep in mind, the X5 is not a soft, plush luxury SUV, it is a sporty SAV (Sport Activity Vehicle), that means a stiffer/sportier ride. I think the 3.0 acceleration is pretty good, but if you want faster acceleration, opt for the 4.4 or 4.8. Also, the X5 is a mid- size SAV, if you want lots of cargo space opt for a larger vehicle."
car_795,"Not too bad, but would not buy again","Well, I decided to write my review after owning the vehicle for 2 years.  It is a lease, and we are due to turn it in in 5 days.  So here goes.  First, my likes.  This is my 3rd BMW, and of all the BMWs I've owned, I have to say this one has been the most reliable.  We have had virtually no issues at all with the car, unlike my last BMWs.  The only real problem we have had with the car in the 2 years, is that the driver's side exterior mirror glass is tarnishing badly, and needs to get replaced.      Things I don't like.  Let me tell you, if you have kids, do NOT buy this car.  It is way too small and short wheelbased for a comfortable family car.  Rides too stiff and seats too hard."
car_796,My Best Friend Car,"I absolutely LOVE this car.  It is my third BMW ('94 318 sedan; '04 325ci convertible preceded it).  This is the best vehicle I've had and made me know I must always drive a BMW.  It gets 23 mpg on the highway, loads my Labrador in the back seat and all of my horse equipment for foxhunting (saddle, bridle, horse blankets, riding gear, etc.) AND it pulls my extremely large Thoroughbred/Clydesdale cross in a 2 horse trailer.  This is a 6 cylinder engine we're talking about.  Then it cleans up and is the handsomest car in the group and extremely prideworthy to either arrive at a cocktail party or to my job as a lawyer in the city.  The car is the best.  May it live forever! I LOVE IT!"
car_797,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"We LOVE this car!  When we first bought it, I was creating errands and reasons to drive! Two years later, I still get excited every time I get into it! Our teenagers and toddler are all comfortable in the backseat as well! We've packed and moved things one would hardly believe!  It even tows our 26 foot sailboat! This is a purchase we'll never regret other than we'd like the optional 7 seats. A trade in may be in the near future! A repeat buy is a sure way to define exceptional quality and experiences!"
car_798,"Great Overall, But...","This is our 3rd BMW; we've owned the 325i and 525i as well. This car handles beautifully and I feel very safe in it. It is a joy to drive and is extremely comfortable, especially on long trips. That being said, BMW really dropped the ball on the interior design.  What kind of car only offers a cassette player in-dash with a navigation system?  The only way I could get a CD system was to put it in the cargo area - doesn't work for me at all.  Also, the radio doesn't seem to pick up our area's signals too well, no matter what the settings are. The nav system is not great, BMW gave me an outdated CD at time of purchase - having problems getting replacement. Probably won't buy this one again."
car_799,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"I really like this vehicle.  It handles well, comfortable ride, great sound system, and lots of extra goodies.  Fuel efficiency is not the best 14.8 around town but considering the V6, it's not bad.  The only thing is the narrowness of the front windshield.  Creates a blindspot when going around curves.  Also, the back window does not open at all.  MINOR items considering the overall performance, handling, and satisfaction of this ride!!"
car_800,2006 BMW X5,"A perfect car! Awesome. If you need a big sports car, you will never find a better one than this 4.8is. Its acceleration is shocking, brakes, steering and everything. Don't hesitate to get one."
car_801,A joy to own,"This is our second X5 (2003) which we loved and kept in the family. The 2006 is even better with tighter steering, an improved rear gate and a navigation system."
car_802,BMW X5 4.4,"Terrific vehicle, just love the way that it grips the road.  The seating position and all of the gauges, and instruments are perfectly located."
car_803,Still The Ultimate Driving Machine,"Even though this vehicle is an SUV, it is still a great driving and great handling vehicle. Like all German made cars, this one is no different, over-engineered in every aspect mechanically. That being said however, some driver conveniences are overlooked in the process. Many cabin and driver functions are overly complex. The panoramic moon roof is awesome, but it does not close automatically when you turn off the ignition. The windshield washer always washes the headlights as well. Many controls are hard to find while driving, which causes you to take your eyes off the road. Brake dust is a BMW trait, and the wheels are very hard to keep clean. It's still a BMW and gets lots of oohs and ahhs"
car_804,Nice ride,"Overall, this is a great SUV."
car_805,On cloud nine!,"After 6 months of research, I finally decided on the 4.4 X5.  I am soo happy with my decision. I really feel the X5 is the top. I was driving a 2004 Grand Cherokee, and it can not even compare, except for I can no longer go 4- wheeling on the beach. On the highway it handles just like the 530 and is quicker."
car_806,I love my new X5!,"I love the looks of the body shape, love the sporty wheels available, love the navigation system, and love the power of the 4.4 liter engine.  Whatta beast!  When you say MOVE, it MOVES!"
car_807,3rd row seat coming,"We just bought a 2006 X5.  Looked at others in this class. One of the most important reasons we decided on the BMW was the missing 3rd row seat. They are virtually inaccesible in the other SUVs we looked at.  I know people want this 3rd. seat, but be realistic, they are worthless for humans older than 6. If BMW had this seat, we would have gotten an Audi A6."
car_808,Repeat Customer,"This is my 3rd BMW and this absolutely the best so far. There was no question as to what car to purchase when we wanted a new vehicle. As an added bonus, BMW has improved this model with better mileage, better handling and a few interior changes such as the huge sun/moonroof, (my last one was identical but 4.6is). I enjoy driving this car because it is so safe, solid,  comfortable and responsive. I like the SAV aspect because I can fold the back seats to accommodate my bicycle or opt to put a rack on the rear. I would recommend this car to everyone."
car_809,The Ultimate Drivng Machine,This vehicle REALLY is the ultimate driving machine.  I've enjoyed driving it every time!  This car even makes going to the grocery store fun.  It's the little things I appreciate!! I can hardly wait for the seven passenger!
car_810,Is this really a BMW,"This 06 X-5 was a replacement for a ""Lemon"" 05 of exact color, type and equipment,I think they just swapped plates on the vehicle. The 05 had a bad transmission and sunroof both of which were finally replaced after five months of disgusting arguments. The 06 still had the same problems, those being transmission that didn't know what gear it wanted to be in and a sunroof that leaked and would not close as it was designed to. I have owned seven BMWs and generally thought they were some of the best cars built, this was also my third X-5, but definitely my last. I could go on and on with the problems but there is not enough room in this review. Stay away from this vehicle it is not worth it."
car_811,Love My X5(s),"This is my second X5.  My first one was a 2003 and I loved every second of the three years that I drove it - 36,000 miles.  It is quiet, smooth, a ball to drive, and just the right size for my needs.  Also, it gets surprisingly good mileage - the on-board computer calculated my three-year mileage at 21.0 MPG!  I was so happy with my X5 that I did not even consider another vehicle when my lease was up.  I signed another three year lease last December."
car_812,Wow!!,"The first time you drive the 4.4ltr. X5, you know you are not in Kansas anymore.  I am stationed in Germany and in my previous American built car I felt like I was dodging fire from an aotomatic weapon.  The fast paced world of the Autobahn, is not for the weak of heart.  I cower no more... I am now the king of the road!!  The X5 takes no time to match speed with the best the European's can throw at me.  The X5 hugs the road at 100, 110, 120 even 130 MPH like the family wagon at the more modest but not as much fun American speeds I am used to.  As far as comfort, Dreamy.."
car_813,great car,I love this car. Traded in a 2000 ford expedition and I do not miss it. This car has power and speed and just looks great. The only improvement BMW could do is get rid of the tape player with the navigation system. Who uses a tape player? We are in the age of MP3 players and BMW should take a serious look at improving to this technology. Also please update your whole audio system. Your upgrade Harmon audio system should be compatible to the navigation system. With these concerns I still do love to drive it. BMW is truly the ultimate driving machine.
car_814,Wife's Car,"I bought this car for my wife and our 2 year old son. It is very heavy which means it is safe, however, the weight is a problem with getting in to move from the start. Once going, the ride is great. I recommend it to anyone wanting a BMW SUV. Skip the X3. Gas mileage is OK. I haven't tried towing my boat with it yet, but it says it tows 6,000... Safe car, no blind spots and easy to park."
car_815,Awesome suv...but not for women,"This is my 2nd X5 and I have never had a problem except with sticking doors in both of them. Speaking of doors, they are heavy and close by themselves, knocking women and smaller men off their feet. Is it worth the safety they provide? Your preference. Ride is amazing. Visibility is too. No need for the 4.4, unless you want to dragrace on the interstate."
car_816,Love my X5,Car is classy to drive and it turns heads. I like the quiet soft ride. I like sitting high and the excellent visability.  Handles beautifully and it has gentle manners. Quality of construction and materials is superb.
car_817,Second X5 and might buy a third one!,"Without a question, this is the 4WD to have. Pricey vehicle; but the best by all means.  I would have given a perfect reliability score, but a faulty passenger seat sensor that activates the air bag left me without my X5 for 29 DAYS because the spare part had to be ordered from Germany, and part number was not availble???  That said, the dealer loaned me a fantastic 530 for the whole time the X5 was in service and every day they kept me informed about the situation, with a very professional and courteous approach."
car_818,I'm thrilled so far!,"It was hard to part with my 7 series that I loved and have driven for the past 8 year.  I was considering ML500, XC90, Cayenne S and X5 4.4.  ML500 and XC90 did not have heated steering as an available option, which was one of my criteria.  After test-driving X5 4.4; I knew it was the right choice.  Drives like a dream.  Great power, great cornering... and it is fun to drive! I've only had it 6 days, but it's a BMW..... you just can't go wrong!"
car_819,Big Fun,"Outstanding handling, performance and a thrill to drive! BMW focuses on the driving experience vs ""gadgets"". It didn't take long to decide on the X5 after test driving the competitors."
car_820,comfort and gas,"I would like to say a few things about my X5, the price was great, but i should of test drive the car first, I got the sports package which makes the ride of the car very bumpy,  I had no idea it was going to be so rough.  But one good thing about the car is that i'm very surprised it gets great gas milage for a big V8."
car_821,2005 BMW X5 3.0 w/6-speed transmission,"I've had the car for 6 months and like it more each time I drive it.  The seat comfort, handling, shifting and ride are superb. On long rides the seats allow you to arrive refreshed rather than tired. The car handles solidly at high speeds and corners nimbly without roll. The 6 speed is super smooth and quick. The highway ride is like floating on a cloud."
car_822,excellent,"It was hard to switch over to the BMW X5 4.4i for the Volvo XC90, but within hours I was in love with this vehicle.  It's like driving a cloud.  The weather in New England has been rough this fall and this SUV handles like a dream.  Thank you."
car_823,Yes. It's umtimate driving machine.,"4.4 with sports package and 19"" wheels, it looks aggressive and really is. It can drive silky smooth, pass effortless in any speed, and stop on a dime. 3.0 is a bit lag from start, but 4.4 is really fast and fast. Cargo space is a bit tight, but who cares that in this driving machine. It drives like a sport sedan. Minimum body lean on curve. Panorama moon roof is fresh. Overall mileage is about 20miles/gallon which is not that bad at all. I'm excited every morning when I sit on it. How many cars can give you this sort of excitement?"
car_824,step up to a 4.4i,"Had a 03, 3.0 and loved it. Just bought a 4.4.Sport. Wow what a difference. BMW took out all the kinks from the old model. Real quiet inside, solid ride, agile, great acceleration. Get the sport package. Seats are more comfy. I drive this truck in n.y.c. Handles the roads unbeliveable. Fixed the annoying hatch rattle and now easy to remove rear cover. Expensive, but you get what you pay for. Gas mileage sucks. But what is perfect in life? If money is an issue you don't deserve to drive this truck, sorry..."
car_825,"X5, The Other Side Of SUV`s","I love driving, and I mean driving, searching for the limits of my car in a twisty road that I have to take to go to work everyday, but I have never driven something like my brand new BMW X5is. It is powerful enough to climb any place I want, and it can go offroad with style too, but that`s not what this car is about. This thing is just perfect for those who seek true sports car performance and need a little more room in the rear seat plus go offroad some times."
car_826,Good- net yet great!,"This vehicle could use a bigger trani. In 2000 when the 1st one rolled off the floor there was a different and better transmission used. However, BMW still has not yet learned to LISTEN to their consumers. And, hense, will not be great, until such time that they do!!!  BMW still has not figured out how to provide an in dash CD player with the navigation system... Who needs a cd player in their trunk anyway? Sure--we traveled 11 hrs to NC and loved emptying the car to change disks... WAKE UP BMW AND LISTEN TO US WOMEN AND WHAT WE WANT ...WE HAVE BEGUN DRIVING THE GREAT CARS AND THEY DRIVE THE CRUMMY CAR TO THE TRAIN OR BUS EACH DAY!!!!!"
car_827,THE SUV OF DREAMS,"OVERALL THIS IS THE BEST SUV I HAVE 
EVER DRIVEN COMPARED TO ALL THE 
HIGHLINE SUV."
car_828,X-5 4.4i,"I have had the X-5 for 2 months and the
driver side window had to be repaired. 
The coolant warning keeps coming up
although the BMW dealership says there
is nothing wrong.  Also had to get knob
for the radio controls changed.  Car is
still under warranty so was covered for
everything.  Will probably get anxious
when the warranty runs out in a couple
of months."
car_829,All kinds of weather it holds the road.,"If you live in an area as I do with 
plenty of snow/rain and steep hills, 
this is the vehicle for you and your 
family.
My first experience with BMW and it has 
made me a BMW owner for life."
car_830,Solid Feel,"What a great car. Very responsive and 
fun to drive. The all-wheel drive 
system provides very solid 
manueverability and handling in turns. 
Both interior and exterior fit and 
finish are outstanding. My experience 
with the dealer was also very positive."
car_831,My Blue BMW - Just Awesome!!!,"This SAV is truly a truck wrapped in 
luxurious clothing. I have thoroughly 
enjoyed getting to know this vehicle. 
It has lots of power, a nice stereo 
system, and quality construction. Would 
recommend for those who desire to be 
among the best on the road in any type 
of weather."
car_832,BEST SUV I'VE OWNED,"The 2001 X5 3.0 I own has been the best 
Suv I've owned and they include 
pathfinders, Durangos, Explorers and 
Escalades. The blend of Size and 
performance reminds me more of a five 
series sedan then a SUV. It could use a 
bit more cargo capacity but I have more 
then adapted to that. Ride comfort is 
excellent and the power and handling on 
the highway are outstanding. I compared 
the Mercedes, Land Rover and Lexus 
before purchasing and was more 
impressed by the Style, price and 
performance of the X5"
car_833,Knifeman's X5,"This vehicle is the smoothest road car 
we have ever owned.  It is far 
superior to anything designed in 
Detroit.  I am considering buying a 
second to use on my daily commute.  
Fuel mileage is not as good as I wish 
it was, but comfort and reliability 
make up for this slight weakness.  The 
car is a bit expensive to maintain, 
but we are very happy with it."
car_834,Great car,"The only issue we have had with this 
suv is that the bulbs blow every other 
month in the front headlights (not 
Xenon).  The dealer replaces them with 
no problem - just drive up and they'll 
come outand pop in new bulbs.  Other 
than that, it is a great car."
car_835,"BMW X5 ""Pinto in a 3 piece suit""","What do you get from BMW's latest 50K+ 
SUV?  I think of it as a Pinto in a 3 
piece suit.  Looks great, fun to drive 
but an absolute junker in terms of 
quality and reliability, not to mention 
some of the worste customer service I 
have ever experienced.    BMW USA has 
proven to be horrible in terms of 
customer service and apparently have no 
problem leaving thier customer's 
literally out in the cold.  If your 
looking to drop 50K on an SUV don't"
car_836,CPO 2001 X5 for the wife,"Bought it for Valentine's Day and she 
loves it!!  A little rougher ride 
coming from a '97 Acura RL but the 
handling, acceleration, and sound 
system are awesome.  This is the only 
SUV my wife liked that doesn't make her 
feel like 'soccor mom'! So far, I've 
just noticed a rattle in the driver's 
door and in the rear climate control 
unit, but overall I am inpressed with 
the solid feel of the X5.  We've test 
driven multiple MDXs and have not felt 
as secure.  With the CPO warranty and 
lots of prayer, I hope to limit my 
trips to the dealer for service."
car_837,Electrical gremlins,"Our 2001 4.4 X5 is the ""Ultimate 
driving machine"".  We love everything 
about it except...  It has electrical 
gremlins in it.  The dash warning 
lights come on and off all the time, 
indicating the need to check rear and 
brake lights.  We take it to the 
dealership, they replace what is 
broken, if the check lights are 
actually still on when we get to the 
dealership and we go home. Some time a 
few days later, it happens again.. 
Check rear lights etc...   Consumer 
reports rates the 2001's electrical 
system very poor.  Newer models are 
much improved."
car_838,"Speed, fun and comfort !!","Yes they have electrical glitches, but 
the car has to be good for all of us 
to still keep it eventhough that 
fact.  Rides and drives almost like a 
540i with cargo room for the 6' lumber 
I bought at Home Depot.  Plus it pulls 
my 20' Boat with no problem.  Build 
quality is execelent.  These vehicles 
are used on the road, and if thats 
your case this is an excelent SUV.  
Speed, fun and comfort!"
car_839,Disappointed!,"Purchased a 2001 X5 3.0 and it came 
with the pre-owned certification.  
Sold my Grand Cherokee and bought this 
and have total regrets.  X5 only had 
23000 miles when purchased and it has 
been back to the shop 3 times in the 
last month.  Many little mechanical 
and electrical things wrong with the 
car.  Fortunately Classic BMW in 
Mentor, Ohio has been fantastic and 
has fixed everything with no problems, 
but I wish I took my $35k and bought a 
new Volvo or Acura.

Do your homework before you buy this 
car!  Read the reviews, the problems 
people are having are real!"
car_840,70k and love it,"No problems in 70k miles.  Solid, well 
built truck.  Wonderful vehicle.  Not a 
lot of room in the rear."
car_841,X5 - A problem waiting to happen,"X5 is great to drive, handles great at 
80 mph.  Build quality is terrible for 
a vehicle in this price bracket.  Too 
many recalls to mention.  BMW service 
has become poor.  BMW needs to get back 
and correct their customer service."
car_842,3 Years of Mostly Fun,"After 3yrs of driving, experience has been 
mostly good.  Fun to drive, decent fuel 
economy. Biggest problem has been 
window lifts!  Every lift has been replaced 
once, driver door twice.  Have been told by 
dealer this is a weak point in a number of 
BMW products.  Other problems have been  
peeling door handles, gas tank sensors. 
Dealer has been great, taking care of us.  
Thinking hard as to whether to lease 
another one.  Window  lifts are biggest 
concern to us on an otherwise good 
experience."
car_843,Needs more space,This car needs more trunk space
car_844,X5 3.0,"BMW X5 ROCKS.. This SAV is much better 
than the Lexus. Mercedes, or Acura."
car_845,2001 X54.4i,"Pros: 
Engine Power-its a 540 with a 
fridge on the roof. This SAV gets up 
and goes.
Digital stereo has amazing sound
Overall comfort supperior to any 
other SUV.  Plenty of leg & shoulder 
room. Great for long drives.
Handles just like any other BMW - like 
ridding on rails.
VERY safe car -5 Star rating.

Cons:
I use the BMW Term SAV is stead of 
SUV - since there is little utility in 
the cargo bay. They need to stretch 
the cargo bay 1-2 feet more.  No 
wonder they offer a travel trailer to 
pull behind the X5. 
Fit and Finish of the door pulls. Mine 
have been replaced twice, my finger 
nail scratches the finish off."
car_846,BMW is BMW after all,"The car is amazing, great quality, 
design, ride and etc.  When going 80 
MPH it feels like 40 on a regular car."
car_847,What is happening to BMW Quality/Service,"I have had major problems with my X-5.  
Most seem to have been electrical.  It 
is in the shop every other month.  The 
problems range from dieing while 
driving to headlights and directionals 
burn outs.  The car only has 23000 
miles on it and should not be 
experiencing such problems.  On the 
other hand, BMW service has 
deteriorated.  The dealership even 
scratched the vehicle and refuses to 
pay for it.  Corporate has been no help 
with resolving the issue.  I will never 
buy another BMW."
car_848,Too Many Defects,"Certified Preowned with 24k miles. Over 
3 months we had over 15 different 
problems & took it in for repairs 6 
times. From break problems to false 
airbags lights to buzzing under the 
dash to CD door sticking to loose 
driver side mirror they never could 
tighten even after installing a brand 
new kit. The dealership finally bought 
the car back from us."
car_849,Best of the Best,"Brought a used x5 with 27000k it is like
a new car. Drove it to N.C. 4x's since
brought. Should have broght one years
ago. Noything but smiles here. Although
they sold me the car saying it had
sports suspension... it does not. Still
happy they will make it up"
car_850,need better relibility,"transmission went out at 29000, no 
reverse, many other little problems, 
back hatch sticks, park distance 
control 2 times replaced sensors, now 
have some awfully squeaking sound.  
Love the way the car drives but lacks 
reliability."
car_851,BMW X5 4.4,"The 2001 BMW X5 supports BMW's mantra 
of performance.  My vehicle performs 
as well as some sports cars (4.4 & 
sports package required) and provides 
excellent acceleration.  I am 
disappointed in the vehicle 
quality (radiator crack) along with 
numerous computer/electronic failures 
(engine, transmission, fuel gauge, CD 
player,etc)  requiring unnecessary 
trips to the local dealer.  

In the three years of leasing the 
vehicle, I have had the vehicle towed 
three times (all between 15K - 28K 
miles).  My expectation for a $60,000 
vehicle are much higher than a $30K 
vehicle and will purchase a Lexus or 
Infiti vehicle next."
car_852,"Awesome SUV, but Quality SUCKS","Dear BMW,

Please build your next X5 line with 
two major changes:

1: Do something about the terrible 
build quality.  I have owned mine for 
almost 3 years now, and it's been in 
the shop about once every 2 months (or 
more often) the whole time.  The worst 
incident was when it took your 
dealership's repair folks THREE 
separate attempts to fix my leaking 
radiator expansion tank (and I may be 
about to make a 4th trip to get it 
fixed AGAIN).

2: Make the damn thing 6 inches 
longer, and put all the extra space in 
the cargo area (and btw, offer a 3rd 
row seat while you're at it)."
car_853,When you have to drive the best,"The best SUV on the market and the 
fastest. German engineering all the 
way. all my freinds that have driven 
mine, have bought one (five). The 
biggestbang for the bucks, nothing 
compares to it.....nothing. In a league 
of it'e own. try it and you'll see. 
warning..you have to be smart enough to 
know the difference."
car_854,"Awesome to drive, but build quality sux","I love this car.  It is without 
question the most fun SUV to drive on 
the market.

If you've driven a Ford Expedition or 
the like, take an X5 for a test 
drive.  If you are driving enthusiast, 
you'll never want to drive anything 
else.  The handling is amazing in a 
vehicle of this type and weight.

That being said, it leaves a lot to be 
desired in terms of build quality.  Or 
let me just say that BMW X5 build 
quality can be summed up in two words: 
it sucks.

If you buy a new one, do yourself a 
favor and get the longest extended 
warranty you can (100k miles, I 
believe)... that's assuming you plan 
to keep it that long."
car_855,well worth the money,"The best car i have ever had ,such a 
fun car to drive , safe , comfortable, 
chic,the best suv of all"
car_856,An out performed vehicle with poor rest,"Its performance is rated at best 
compare to the other cars I've 
driven.  The handling is awsome.  It's 
a beautiful car from the outside, but 
terrible from the inside.  There are 
lack of gadgets and toys compare to 
the Japanese vehicles.
However, since I bought this car, I 
had to take a day off work at least 
once every other months to take it 
back to the dealership for service.  
My window broke 3 times.  It doesn't 
roll up and down.  The light gets 
burned out.  The fuse burned out.  I 
can give you a long list, but you get 
the idea.  So if you are willing to 
deal with the problems just so that 
you can have an out performed car, 
than this car is for you."
car_857,2001 BMW X5 3.0I Excellent Ve,"I have had my X5 for over 1 year. In my 
opinion, the vehicle has excellent 
handling in heavy rain as well as dry 
pavement. The car has precision 
steering and is very stable under 
emergency turns and maneuvering 
specially at high speeds; much more 
stable than the Chevy Tahoe, Grand 
Cherokee & Explorer. The seats are very 
comfortable and the cabin is quite both 
attributes induce less fatigue during 
long trips."
car_858,Happy Camper,"I own the 4.4 and love this SAV.  The 
power is incredible and it handles 
great.  If you look at the specs of 
the 2003 Range Rover you will see it's 
a larger X5 4.4.  The door locks keep 
malfunctioning and the navigation 
system isn't worth the money but this 
truck is so much fun to drive."
car_859,We must've been lucky...,"We've now had our X5 for almost 2 
years.  We love it!  I'm not sure what 
the others, including Consumer Reports, 
are talking about with all of their 
problems.  Since we've had our car, it 
has NEVER been in the shop for any 
problems except for service maintenance 
(knock on wood).  We love the the power 
of the 3.0 and the gas mileage (around 
450mi to the tank).  It's a great car 
to drive and being ranked #1 in safety 
keeps me at rest in a world with some 
irresponsible drivers.  I agree with 
all the positive comments in the other 
posted messages (no need to repeat what 
has already been said)."
car_860,V8 s/b more fun,"great vehicle.  wish it is as powerful 
as the v8, especially with its fuel 
economy."
car_861,2001 BMW X5 3.0,"Handling and build quality are the most
outstanding features of this vehicle.
Aside from the limited space aft and
poor AM/FM radio, the X5 exudes a sense
being sure footed and coveys confidence
in its ability to cope with any all-road
conditions, be it ice, snow, standing
rain, etc.  The most stable , best
handling vehicle in the catagory that we
have owned, (Jeep Grand Cheroke, Ford
Explorer, Pathfinder SE)."
car_862,Poor quality from BMW,"Though I love the handling and 
performance of the X5, the quality and 
reliability have been TERRIBLE.  We 
have documented 27 issues with this 
car in less than 2 years and with only 
15K miles on it.  It has been in for 
repairs 10 times.  Some issues are 
small, such as the paint peeling from 
the door handles, the window motor 
sensors not working, and the key 
memory failing.  But we've had at 
least 4 major issues with the coolant 
system and starter which rendered it 
undriveable.  All of this on a car for 
which we paid $60K!  Our $25K 2001 
Tahoe has been in the shop exactly 1 
time in the same time period.  Which 
is the better value?"
car_863,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"LOVE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CAR.  LOT 
OF FUN TO DRIVE, I LIKE IT AS MUCH AS 
MY 911.  BUT THE CAR IS IN THE SHOP 
EVERYOTHER WEEK.  IT HAS BEEN IN FOR 
SMALL PROBLEMS AND FOR LARGE ONES, SUCH 
AS IT DOES NOT START UNTILL THE 3RD TRY 
AND PARK AVE BMW (WORST SERVICE DEPT 
EVER) CAN NOT FIX IT.  THE NAVIGATION 
SCREEN GOES BLANK AND SOMETIMES THE 
BLINKERS STOP WORKING FOR A WHILE AND 
COME BACK ON. AND THAT IS JUST THE TIP 
OF THE ICEBERG.  BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
car_864,It doesn't get any better,"The looks of this vehicle alone, both 
inside and out, sold me up front.  Then 
I drove it and it is really an awesome 
machine!"
car_865,Dream car.,"I have enjoyed this car from day one, 
and over a year later, still love it. I 
initially test drove the Acura MDX 
(several times), and even had a deposit 
on one. I drove the X5 once, and 
immediately canceled my MDX order.

It handles like a dream, has enough pep 
off the line, and the major components 
are of quality build. People always 
comment on the heaviness of the doors 
upon first entering, and there is an 
overall ""sturdy"" feel."
car_866,a,"most comfortable and best handling 
suv i've ever driven.  also the most 
unreliable and poorest quality built 
vehicle i have ever owned.  just got 
car back again after 8 days in the 
shop to have steering rack replaced 
(at 18,000 miles) and now doors will 
not open from inside.  everytime the 
car goes in for service comes back 
with more problems."
car_867,Poor Quality,"I have had a very poor experience with

its time in the repair shop, with a 
wide range of problems.  I would not

September 2002 and could not be 
happier.  This vehicle is well crafted 
and very powerful.  Test drove the MDX 
and was not impressed with handling and 
design compared to the X5.  Highway and 
local driving is an absolute pleasure. 
Interior design is carefully thought 
out and comfortable.  This is a great 
SAV!"
car_871,SAV,"Great SAV. Handles like a sports cars.
Great response with no tip over fear.
Front seats are very confortable but 
back seats should be improved."
car_872,Best vehicle I've ever owned,"Great transportation. An SUV that 
handles like a sports car. Have 3.0

outstanding. Sure footed in the rain 
and snow. Brakes are superior. I've 
owned 20 + or - different vehicles an

only gets better as the miles rack up."
car_873,The ultimate worst vehicle,"X5 simply quit running on the 
interstate today for the third time in 
2 months.  Fuel sensor and fuel pump 
problems before but I think this time 
it's something else.  Several

car_876,My X5 4.4i,"As expected, the handling and road 
manners are superb. My other car is a 911 
and I am still impressed.
Quality of interior is very high, and my entire 
family loves this vehicle, from the comfort 
standpoint. 
The ride with the sports suspension is firm, 
but this is again what one would expect. It 
rewards the driver with excellent road 
manners and confident road feedback."
car_877,Not the best from BMW,"Model rushed to market without adequate testing in my opinion.Good in 
snow; HVAC wheel controls replaced; door handle replaced due to peeling; 
ball joints replaced after 20,000 miles (car never driven off road) to correct 
cluncking noise; followup service necessary to replace bushings as well. 
This is unacceptable premature front end failure for a vehicle designed for off 
road use..Cabin fairly quiet."
car_878,BEST car I have ever had,"Despite the lack of trunk space this 
is a great car!"
car_879,X5 Let Downs,"Problems started from the day of 
delivery with the rear hatch not 
closing properly. Then the problems 
were the as follows;  Cell 
Phone ""Whine"" from BMW $1700 cell 
phone system,  interior material on 
door handles peeled off ,  rear hatch 
door again broken due to faulity 
switch, in winter the door locks would 
freeze making closing the door 
impossible,  rubber door seals peeling 
off of rear door,  REAR SEAT BELT 
JAMMED, WILL NOT RETRACT."
car_880,BAD CAR!,"Aside from the numerous service issues 
which has precluded me from being able 
to drive the car over the past year and 
a half,  I now have a battery that 
won't hold a charge.   

According to BMW -  ""if you don't drive 
your car 1000 miles a month,  you are 
ABUSING Your car and the warranty is 
not valid"" for the battery.   How bout 
that?  Another $250 down the drain.."
car_881,It Stinks,"Mine was built on a Friday before 
Oktoberfest I think.   Had nothing but 
problems as well as several design 
flaws.  Such as:1) Steering wheel 
electronics subject to shorting.2) 
Software issue:  Mirrors go down in 
reverse and then don't come up. 3) Back 
hatch is not a tight fit. 4)The Shades 
in the back windows latch to a cheap 
latch that breaks. 5) The Rear neck 
supports block your rear view mirror. 
6) The side mirror are way too small. 
7) Ride is lousy with the Sport Package.
8) Known battery issue where in dash CD 
drains the battery.   As well as Engine 
fan.  

Bottom line -  Worst Vehicle I have had 
since my 1976 Cutlass."
car_882,fun but drinks gas,"all around a great car.  watch out for 
the MPG"
car_883,Fun to drive when not in the shop,"My X5 is comfortable and has plenty of power, even though it is the 6 
cylinder. I have had it back and forth to the local dealership at least 15 times 
while I have owned it with various problems. Some of the problems, from a 
faulty security system to a steering wheel that was replaced and still didn't 
function properly were repetitious. I will be trading this vehicle in 
immediately. Bad mistake."
car_884,Best Car Ever!,"Since purchasing my X5, we have been on 
several long trips and absolutely love 
the comfort, convenience of controls 
and just simply love the drive this 
car!  The frontal visibility is unlike 
any other and the interior is so roomy 
and comfortable that you get spoiled 
and don't want to take any other 
vehicle - anywhere.  Alway reliable, 
drives and feels like a 740I with 4 WD."
car_885,Worth the Money,"Having driven a sedan for so long, I wasn't sure how I would like the feel of a SAV, but I was pleasantly surprised with this vehicle.  The handling and performance lived up to BMW's reputation of excellence.  The 6 cylinder engine made acceleration effortless.  The sleek and well designed interior allows for easy access to all buttons.  I was truly impressed with this vehicle."
car_886,Finally a real SAV,"For the last 9 years I drove US made SUVs....3 differents models and all v8 engines however I exeperiences disappointments from the very first week that I drove any of them. With the BMW X5 I had a paradigm change, finally I can drive a SAV that meet my expectations....and it is a V6 3.0 Liters..price wise??
Altought the montly leasing cost went up of almost $ 150.00 I save at least $ 100.00 in fuel consumption....so for $ 50.00 more per month I got myself I real deal.

car_895,X5 35d nightmare,My 2010 x5 diesel such a nightmare Shame on BMW
car_896,First BMW,"The 2010 BMW X5 was my entry into the BMW brand.It is a nice blend of car and SUV.I bought it with 12,000 miles so took advantage of a price discount by the dealer.I have put 14,000 miles on the car so far and have been pleased.The 2010 'control wheel' (which manages access to radio, navigation, etc.) is much more user friendly than I expected, and improved over 2009 and earlier versions.The finishes and quality earn the great reputation this brand has achieved.Have not had any service issues with the car since purchase."
car_897,Good but not good enough,"We bought a BMW diesel X5 and there is a lot of good things too say like room, looks, fuel economy and performance however in the age of information all I can say is SHAME on BMW.  With all the so called advances surrounding information systems BMW has missed the mark by more than a country mile. The important variables like oil pressure, coolant temperature and battery voltage level are all missing.  This information is all ""vital"" since they provide valuable insight when a system is ""starting"" to fail. I prefer and I am sure that many other drivers would prefer to have maintenance done before you are in a location or at a time where help is hours away.  Again SHAME on BMW & our salesmen."
car_898,I Love This Car!,"I have owned my 2010 BMW X5 35d for 10 months and like the car more now than ever.  The car is a pleasure to drive and gets very good mileage (about 29 mpg highway for me) for a large vehicle.  The low-end torque of the diesel makes it a fun and safe car to drive.  Some people like to hate iDrive, but in 2010 BMW fixed the main issue by adding buttons so that many features can be accessed in one step rather than navigating through menus.  This is an amazingly clean diesel. Hold your hand behind the exhaust for a while. There is no soot or smell.  Great for driving family and dogs around town and on long trips."
car_899,"If you need an SUV, consider a Diesel","The 2010 BMW X5 35d (Diesel) has many advantages and very few disadvantages over its gasoline counterparts.  MPG is outstanding (got 30 MPG NY to VA Beach with 4 adults and 600 lb luggage). Torque rivals that of V8 Model.  Main disadvantage is that you can't use biodiesel with a bio content >5%.  Compared to the 3.0 or the 4.8 L version, the diesel is a bargain.  Yeah, it's a little louder than the 3.0, but 35d's sound under full throttle rivals that of the V8 version.  Another downside is that you can't (or couldn't) get the sport package.  Whether it's the X5D or the Audi Q7D, luxury SUV buyers should really consider the advantages in fuel economy w/o loss of performance."
car_900,"Love it still, after 18,500 miles","I am so happy I bought this diesel! I've had it for 10 months now, and I still look forward to driving it every day.  I'm getting 28.5-29 mpg. pure hwy. driving.  Mixed driving I'm getting around 24.5-25."
car_901,No Southern Comfort,"I leased this 2010 X5 for my wife. I have never leased a car before, but I am glad I did since I will be getting rid of this vehicle ASAP. The car is a gas guzzler and you are constantly filling up. It is just outright inconvenient. The fuel tank is just too small. The backup sensor system so sensitive that it is obnoxious. The air conditioning system is inadequate and very noisy. The left side of the drivers face is always hot during SC Summer months as the A/C airflow is entirely inadequate. Run flat tires seem good until you have a flat or blowout. Then you must depend on BMW roadside service which is useless on the weekends. Very disappointed in this vehicle for the price of the lease."
car_902,Expectations Met or Exceeded,"Did my due diligence (research, test drives) and ordered from factory to my specs. Very satisfied overall - traded in my 2003 530i (great car)- no regrets other than when I signed the check. Great combination of fun to drive/fuel economy/cargo capacity."
car_903,"Nice car, but unreliable","Car is great.  I have everything except Navigation package.  X5 drove great for the first 5200 miles until the electrical system and comfort access failed.  Been without my ride I've had for 5 months for two weeks now.  This is my first BMW, and may be my last, since the X5 is proving to be unreliable."
car_904,WOW including MPG,"We wanted an upgraded fuel conscience SUV, the X5 Diesel is all that we expected and more.  On a road trip we could not believe the performance in a variety of road types and conditions, we kept thinking the fuel gauge was not working, fortunately it was!  Great performance with comfort and passing fueling stations.  Can't rate higher than perfect 10s."
car_905,Not totally in love,My husband loves the engine. It's quiet and peppy. We live in the country and are averaging only 20 mpg. You really do have to read the owner's manual. On the down side my car sits at the dealership because the computer system went down at service and a part has to be manufactured. Five weeks and counting. BMW has been attentive to the situation.
car_906,Awesome,"Just purchased X5 35D it is a great vehicle addresses all the short coming of the previous X5 specially in fuel economy and space utilization. The I-drive takes sometime to get used to but a great improvement over the previous one. We love the all around view of the camera, simply said WELL DONE BMW."
car_907,2010 BMW X5d,"My wife and I love this car. It is very easy to drive and comfortable. The memory seats and adjustments work well for us because she is ""short"" and I am ""tall"". As soon as you unlock the doors with the remote, the proper adjustments to driver seat, mirrors, etc. are done for you. We've had cars with this in the past but this one just seems to work better. The diesel is great with lots of power and the mileage is good, 18-23 mpg. The diesel is very quiet except when it's cold but when it warms up, it purrs like a kitten. We have the 3rd row seat for our grand-kids and it works fine for them but I don't think 2 adults would be comfortable."
car_908,2010 BMW X5d,"We love this car. The diesel is a strong performer and good mileage. We have not experienced the lag time on start up that testers have stated. We got the 3rd row seat to accommodate grand kids and it works great for that, not enough room for adults though. The ride is quiet and firm which we like. We don't even notice the diesel noise, it purrs like a kitten!"
car_909,Awesome Engine,"Awesome engine and handling.  Picking it up at Factory Performance Center was an outstanding experience and makes you feel really safe in this vehicle.  So far we are averaging 24 mpg and this engine really rocks. Thought we wouldn't like the ""I"" drive, however, it is really easy to use."
car_910,My first BMW,"I researched and test drove all the leading 2010 SUVs that are not gas hogs.  Far and away the BMW X5 diesel was the best driving experience.  Mercedes was #2 and Lexus was #3.  The x5 diesel was the most responsive under all driving conditions.  It combines the right amount of power with a great feel for the road.  The brakes are incredible.  The acceleration is excellent.  The ergonomics are outstanding.  For me, the engineers at BMW have really done their homework.  I love the iDrive interface and the integration with my Apple iPhone and iPod.  The backup sensors, rear camera and overhead view are superior to anything I saw from other manufacturers.    Very happy with my choice."
car_911,*drool*,"I've never come across a car that is fun to drive each and every time you press the ""start/stop"" button! The X35D turbo is a rocket on the highway. If the highway is empty and I'm just craving a little get-pushed-in-your-seat-on-take- off fun, I just release the hounds. The 3.0 gas is not bad, but the 3.5D is just plain amazing. Interior technology is great. The backseat is actually spacious like a sedan and not like most SUV's where it's a bit narrower with no thigh support. The engine is of course a bit louder but the roar when you giddy up is fun."
car_912,BMW diesel is awesome,I purchased 2010 4 months ago.  I have 3500 miles on it and I have had no problems.  This automobile is incredible.  The engine is so smooth and powerful.  It feels like you get to 60 mph in 4 secs.  It is effortless and fun to drive.  I do not think I will ever buy a regular gas engine powered car again.  BMW fit and finish is the best.  Everything is first class in this vehicle.  Did I mention that it is fun to drive? The only thing I do not like is run flat tires. Did I mention that it is fun to drive?  I am getting about 23 mpg with about 50/50 city/highway driving.  I hope that BMW does not keep raising their prices so much that they become unaffordable.  Did I mention that it is fun to
car_913,Better than advertised,"Well I've spent about a week with my 2010 X5 3.0. Initial impressions are quite favorable. I am quite taken by the overall fit and finish of the vehicle, it's absolutely beautiful. I went with Sapphire Black, and every option available. Driving thus far has been refined, although I am going to miss that raw thrust and power of my outgoing FX 45, but I need to slow down anyway. Hopefully it will be as reliable as the FX"
car_914,2010 BMW x5 Diesel first quarter,"First of all Bellvue could not have treated me better.  I had been to to other dealerships locally in the Portland area and they were unsat. My only complaint is the Nav system that can't find anything and the sound system. The nav system has Probability of Success for finding something of less than .5. You could go to the vendor website and enter the lat long, but if you don't know where it is then you don't know lat long either. The radio will tune to both HD and standard signals and sometimes both which is the problem. Like an echo due to signal lag. Sound is not exceptional.  Ride is great with the Multi contour seats. Overall car is great though Diesel performs well. Moon roof is nice"
car_915,Will never go back to gas engines,"11,000 miles on a 2010 X5 diesel and I love it. Excellent build quality, performance, comfort, and zero defects. (I'll be first in line for the new X5 4.0d in 2011.) I like the comfort/convenience of an SUV while knowing that clean diesel doesn't pollute like a gas SUV. I looked at the 555hp X5 M, but I can't stomach guzzling gas and polluting like that any more. No tire problems yet. (And yes, whiners in the previous post, your X5 does have a spare tire. Try reading your owner's manual.) I've had 6 X5s since 2001. Although this is the most truck-like vehicle BMW has ever made, it has the best combination of performance, fuel efficiency, low emissions."
car_916,I can't believe it's a diesel!,"I just took delivery of my 2010 X5 35D and am grinning from ear to ear from the driving experience and the superb turbo diesel engine.  I have owned 3 series BMWs previously, but decided to buy something bigger.  All in all, the fit and finish and the quality of materials used is second to none.  The new I-drive is more intuitive than I anticipated.  So far, my only complaint is that the car is a bit difficult to get in and out of.  I equipped my X5 with running boards purely for aesthetics and found that it actually impedes one's ability to enter and exit the car and leaves dirt on one's pants.  My experience with the car is too new to report on its fuel efficiency.  The sound system is nice."
car_917,Update after 6500 miles,"After 6500 miles this car has not had a single problem. Average fuel economy is 26.3 mpg. Most of my trips have been 300-400 miles of highway at 80- 85 mph with 60 or so miles of urban driving. For me, this is such a perfect vehicle as it handles long open stretches effortlessly but handles like a sports car in cities and mountains. To those who have rated this car low I can only suggest either they are an anomaly or they have an agenda."
car_918,Very Poor Reliability,"Very poor reliability.  I am not going to say much other than if you buy one you were warned.  Maybe because they are build in the states and not Munich. Maybe because they have so much electronics that no one knows how to fix when it breaks but mine has been nothing but problems. Climate control issue, leaking of fluids and high battery discharge than can leave you stranded and has twice. The sedans seem fine and I should know as I drive loaners of 1, 3 and 5 series more than my SUV.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
car_919,Amazing vehicle but tires are major flaw,"I love this vehicle!I ordered the diesel even though I live in Minnesota and it delivers as advertised even in -18 deg.It's worth every penny regardless of the negative reviews on price and the I-Drive (which is great!).I'm a car guy and this thing just rocks.Close your eyes, sign on the line and you won't be sorry. No comparison to any of the other Lux SUVs that I drove, amazing! One issue to keep in mind. The vehicle came with Bridgestone Dueler H/L tires as OE and they are awful. Since new, they have droned on so loudly that I went back to the dealer at 850 miles thinking there was an issue.There is, as they are cupping but the dealers hands are tied until 5K miles. Avoid these tires!"
car_920,Love it!,"My Land Rover LR3 lease was coming to an end and I have been looking at a lot of different options for my next vehicle.  I came across a black X5 Diesel on the BMW of Arlington website and decided to take a test drive.  I was really impressed from the moment I first got in.  It is very well appointed, has lots of useful technologies, and is amazing to drive.  I really liked my LR3 but the X5 is part sports car and part SUV.  The diesel is so strong and awfully quiet.  Fuel mileage is double what I got in the LR3.  The parking attendants at my parking garage think it is the nicest vehicle they have ever seen.  Best car decision I ever made."
car_921,Best utility vehicle,"I drove Mercede Banze for passed 10 years.Now, I had BMW X5 for 3 months. I drove it on snowing condition and went to ski resort at mountain road. X5 tracking is better than any MB I had. The car is full loaded. I'm 100 % satisfy, especial for X5D toque and mileage, leather interior too."
car_922,X5 35d Twin Turbo - 'nuf said,"I commute 120 miles a day, so I need a car with both fuel economy and an exciting driving experience.  My commute has gone from a total drag to something I actually look forward to.  The 425lbs of torque plaster me to the drivers seat and the responsive steering makes maneuvering in traffic a breeze.  I chose the Premium Package, Technology Package, Sports Package, Cold Weather Package and Rear Climate Package with running boards and roof rack.  I have put just over 1000 miles on the vehicle and the on-board computer is reporting that my average speed is 47 miles per hour with a MPG of 25.6.  This is better average MPG than my Honda Accord!  I would recommend the X5 35d to anyone!"
car_923,powerful and solid,"I've only had the car for 1 week, I did spend more than I was planning but the engine and interior made the extra worth it. I enjoy the solid ride and am impressed with the power and responsive handling. I like the safety ratings and fuel mileage and hope to have this car for a long time. I give it a 5 star rating at this time."
car_924,Good but miss expectation,"Got the new X5 for a very good price. With just a few hundreds over invoice and factoring in the $2500 rebate, great deal.  Had a BMW 330i with ZHP before. Expected a similar ""best in class"" dynamic. Was quite disappointed.  The vehicle is close to my outgoing 2001 MDX than the 330i in terms of performance and handling. Don't know about the turning radius myth. Where my MDX could make a straight U turn, I have had to do w/ 3 point turns.  Big gaps in the doors letting dirts in.  Tires are run-flat only. Hugely expensive as BMW disallow repairs. A small nail had cost me $400."
car_925,Perfect,"I ordered an X5, 4.8 with:  Cold Weather PKG Premium PKG Tech PKG rear climate 3rd row  The ride is great, performance is exciting and everything just feels right.  No need for premium sound system, the base package is pretty good, and I like  to listen to loud music."
car_926,BMW X 5 diesel,"Really like the vehicle but hate the Navigation system.  Not only can it not find an address that has been there for 30 years, but it won't let you enter an address if it doesn't recognize it.  You can go to the developer's web site if you know the latitude and longitude of the address and they will verify it and enter it in the update.  Not good. Overall quality of the vehicle was excellent so far and the dealer was very good to me."
car_927,Needs better quality & reliability,"The X3 and X5 have the same 3.0 sized engine. But the X5 is about 1000lbs heavier.  Where is the ""Efficient Dynamics""?  It is sluggish after making turns.  You are constantly downing shifting gears just to be normal on the roads.  This one is not part of the Ultimate Driving machine class!!"
car_928,Horrible X5,"Lost wiper in heavy rain storm,  one of the windows insisted to open on the freeway and flooded my car.  The next day it magically cured itself.  Alarm goes off on its own.  I have observed this myself.  Nothing passed by my X5 with loud music or exhaust.  MY dealer cant figure it out.  The battery is excellent.  Lost the driver's memory seat, fixed it then it was the passenger's memory seat.  What's next?  When the car goes over a bump, the rear wiper and washer are on.  You all get the idea..."

car_935,Ultimate Driving Experience,Expect to be taken to new heights
car_936,I knew what I was buying......,"Full Disclosure.   Ive been in the automotive service and repair industry for almost 40 years.   That said, I knew of the maintenance and repair issues these Beasts have.   And No,  An extended warranty wont cover the large expenses (as they are considered normal wear and tear).   I bought the vehicle for a song and a dance. 2nd owner, 109k and beautiful.   But i also prepared my own repair fund for it, and will probably gobble that up in no time.   These are expensive to repair and maintain properly.   Budget $2500.00 a year for it and Enjoy the finest performing suv out there.....especially for the money."
car_937,Buyer be aware!,"Overall this was a high performing, satisfying experience. However, the frequency of my trips to the repair shop had both me and my mechanic frustrated, and diminished the positive feeling. The problem with these vehicles is the expense of highly specialized parts and the time needed to repair. If you're not ready to absorb these expenses, do not purchase this car."
car_938,"Buy one, love it, and be prepared for maintenance","As a good friend said to me before I bought my first bimmer, they don't break often, but when they do, its expensive. This car is no exception.  That being said I buy low priced, high quality cars. I prefer them depreciated from their showroom pricing, but in good condition. We bought our 2009 BMW X5 with 92K on it. In the last 24 months we have spent about 6-7K in repairs.  The car does need special therapy. The tight tolerances of the sensors, the tight standards of the brakes, tires, wheel bearings, and glow plugs mean constant mechanic massaging.  BUT!!!! When this car is running right(80% of the time) it is simply the best car I have ever driven.  Insanely fast, stable, and powerful. With snow tires I have conquered the toughest storms that Colorado can throw at me.  Do yourself a favor. Buy one of these cars with 90-100K on it, set aside $6K in repair dollars(that is still half of the original sticker price) and you will own a great car. A really great car."
car_939,Big Machine Worth it !,"Never have had a problem, it's a 2009.  Last week had to have left front headlight replaced. Been very satisfied with it. Just the other day a friend ask me about it, he's thinking seriously  about getting one. Love the steering, the way it hugs the road, the pickup, in fact it all feels like it fits tight, I feel safe!"
car_940,I've been had!,"I was seduced by its good looks and big engine. Our X5 has been a maintenance nightmare. Something very expensive fails on this vehicle about once every 6 months. Out of warranty fixes has cost us about $5000-$6000 per year since owning it. The latest news is it failed to pass smog due to value leaks. My BMW tech told me this is common for this engine. Well, now I have to spend another $6000k ($500 in parts, 45 hours of labor!) to replace the value seals just to get it to pass smog. This is my second and last BMW."
car_941,Biggest bucket of worms I've ever owned,"Bought the car with the extended warranty. Started out having to replace the bulbs of the headlights several times. The run flat tires are expensive, no spare. The computer display will display the message that you have a flat and to pull over, or drive for 50 miles if you have run-flats, however the computer will not allow you to exit this screen and switch to navigation. Was on a trip in Canada when I had a flat and had no idea which would be the closest city. Battery drains in a heart beat if you open and close the back hatch several times while packing for a trip. Need a big truck to give you a jump. Had to replace battery twice within the first 5 years. The plastic components like inside driver door handle and steering wheel spokes are crap. The have a thin colored plastic coating on it that bubbles up and peels off. Was told it is the acid in my skin - first car ever that was allergic to me! On 05Aug15 I had the routine maintenance done. The warranty ran out 18Aug15, but I only had 86937 miles on the car. On 20Aug15 I break down on the side of the road with a trunk full of perishable groceries. Had to have it towed to dealership 50 miles away. Electronic water pump and thermostat needed to be replaced $1950. Picked up the car the next week and on the drive home the A/C went out. They picked up the car the next day, and it needed a new compressor at $3,000. Received the car two days later and now the passenger side electric mirror control is messed up. Run, honey, run!"
car_942,"leaky, oily and sealless","My wife and I are over 70 and do not drive aggressively.  The car was never red lined or even close.The car is fun to drive but very expensive with excessive repairs.All recommended maintenance, oil changes, brake pads, brake flushing, alignment, etc. were done on or ahead of schedule.The car has 85,000 miles on it and has had over $14,000 in out of factory warranty repairs.The dealer labor is $150+ an hour and the dealer parts are 1.3 to 3 times more than the same OEM part when available outside.The AC leaked during the 50,000 warranty and a connection hose was replaced.  Everything else failed and was repaired after 50,000 and by 85,000 miles.Most failures have been acknowledged by the dealer and on the internet to be a common failures on a BMW V8 engine.Repairs:Head light washer nozzle came off and was replaced.Water tank split at seam and was replaced.Vacuum pump leaked and was replaced.Oil seals on front of engine leaked and were replaced.Front end bushings were worn and were replaced.Engine valve cover gaskets leaked and were replaced.Engine Valve seals leaked and were replaced.Fuel pump leaked  vacuum and was replaced.I recommend you not own this car after 50,000 miles unless you have an extended warranty.  Thank goodness i had one.UpdateThe car now has 106,000 miles on it.The fuel pump has been replaced again.My extended warranty company has spent over $21,000 in repairs at the Dealership.BMW issued a recall over a year ago on the passenger air bag but has not replaced it yet.I stand by my earlier report.UPdate againThe car has 111,000 miles on it.The passenger seat airbag recall has not been replaced.   BMW does not have the new airbag but they continue to sell new cars with. presumably new good air bags!At my last dealer inspection, I was told I needed to replace my rear brake shoes which had less than 3 mils thickness left.  It had only been 25,000 miles since the original pads which lasted 85,000 were replaced.  I took the car to a second dealer.  The rear brake shoes  had 6/7 mils.  The original dealer rechecked again and confirmed their mistake.The car seems to runs and drives fine but the valve clicking noise outside the car is excessive.  I am told this is normal.Although not recommended,  I had transmission fluid and differential fluid changed, and have engine oil changed every 10,000 to 11,000 miles (not the recommended 15,000 or when the service light indicates)."
car_943,Quality issues ?,"This car was great the first 3 years I owned it.  Year 4, 5 were more troublesome and 5+ downright maddening.  Since the Warranty expired, had to replace the following at about $5000-7000 per year average cost:
- IBS sensors and cables (twice)
- Alternator
- batteries/brakes (only normal wear and tear repair I have had to make)
- Catalytic converter

it only has 30k miles on it!

Aside from the issues above, the service I received was really disappointing (but maybe it's just my area).  I heard from various sources there was a lot of local turnover and some challenges in the dealer/manufacturer relationship and that was certainly reflected in the service levels I experienced."
car_944,First BMW X5 purhcase...,"When you look past the iDrive and price, what a vehicle. Nothing this big I have ever driven handles as well as the X5. The interior is timeless and the exterior is just enough the combo of aggressiveness/luxury. I have the 4.8i with the big v8. Talk about ballsy, this thing gets up and goes, however I do not drive it hard as I am concerned for the price of gas. I will say that if you are genuinely considering buying one, you must have the money for maintenance (regardless of warranty or not) someone financially unstable should not even think of buying this SUV. The oil changes, tires WILL bite your wallet at some point. I have not found the rattling for rear gate, its bothering me..bad."
car_945,People mover with class and performance,I must say the BMW X5 3.0 i x-driveis a excellent looking & driving suv. it's not X5m fast but perfect for everyday use. The cabin is very comfortable and build quality and materials are of the highest quality and also safety and the brakes are very good and drives very tight. It gives you the room you need to move the family around with out losing the performance and style. Build quality and reliability is as good as it gets. I have had many vehicles from different car manufacturers and all have needed parts and service. If you do your services on time which many people don't do with German cars you will be fine. Don't be fooled thinking other brands of cars or trucks don't need servicing or parts I say buy what you can afford and like and it won't bother you servicing it. And you need to pay to play !
car_946,Great SUV,"I bought a off lease 09 X5 D after my wife's new explorer was hit and totaled. After only a few days all i can say is wow! 425 pound ft of torque and 28 mpg on the highway is an incredible combination. The X5 has amazing handling and great brakes.We have owned a fx 35, a xc 90 and a ford explorer and this X5 is by far the best SUV we have owned. This engine is perfect for a 5000 lb truck. It pulls effortlessly and for such a heavy vehicle it has great pick up. If you are looking for the perfect combo of fuel mileage, power, comfort and handling look no further. I highly recommend"
car_947,Disappointed,"It seemed promising at first, but after a few months I'm done with it. There are more rattles than an old Volvo, the 3.0 is weak, iDrive is useless, the run flats are crazy expensive and have NO traction in snow, and it rides worse than my F-150 4X4. Actually, my F-150 is built better, more dependable, has equal handling and performance, and gets about the same gas mileage. Now the evaporator is leaking freon. Maybe this 3rd trip in the dealer can resolve these issues."
car_948,Roadside Assistance is a Scam,Called for a jump start and got a street looking guy with a battery pack not enought AMP to start my X5d.Called again and waited one hour.They couldn't find any well equipped tow truck to jump start my car.I finally used my own AAA and a full size truck showed up in 15 minutes.This happened in Downtown LA!Called BMW and they provided no comment.
car_949,Wish it were more reliable,My wife has been driving for almost 2 years.  I am trying to decide whether we want to buy from lease.  We have had multiple problems with this car.  We have had a continuous small surge from the start position.  Additionally we had a leak in the sun roof that went into the dash.  They had to replace the dash )leather) and all electronics.  Problem is fixed but it always lurks in my mind.  My wife really likes the car.  Power is good.  Drives good.  We paid extra for the leather dash and upgraded leather seating.  Do not get this car without the vented (cooled) seats.  I have found it to be extremely hot on the bottom:)
car_950,One year after purching X5,"Since I purchased this vehicle, I have put 9,000 miles on it. The fuel mileage is great. On average city traffic, I got 22.4 mile/gal. No problem so far and the quality is better than what I expected after own Japanese cars for many year. The only thing I don't feel comfortable is the car equipped with run flat tires. How can I drive on the interstate highway in a rural area with a flat tire. I decide to buy a spare tire and also replace the run flat tires with regular ones when the time come."
car_951,Marginal Vehicle,The diesel is sluggish during initial acceleration and does not yield the fuel mileage suggested.  Purchased pre-driven '09 BMW Corp vehicle from the dealership that did not disclose appearance and functional issues at the time of sale. The dealer will not cooperatively correct these flaws.
car_952,My Best Buy,"I have recently driven a Mercedes C280, a Mercedes E320 and a Lexus R320, but my BMW X5 is the best vehicle of the lot.  I love the way it looks inside and outside and I have learned to love the way it drives.  The I-Drive was a little difficult to learn, but once mastered is a great way to control the many different features.  I'm 67 years old and learning to drive all over again!"
car_953,the shop guys call it a truck,"Love that diesel note at idle. Reminds me of being in Europe. Can't hear it at speed. Surprising punch with dual sequential turbo. Feels best at 80 mph. Gets an honest 26 mpg at that rate. Town is 17/18. Electronics are suspect. Clock won't boot sometimes. Nav screen will not come up on occasion. Had three Nav heads installed on warranty. Probably fixed. Had an alternator go out, took three weeks to get replacement. Dealer made a courtesy payment! With all those gears it is hard for trans to select medium takeoff velocity. Easy is fine and stoop on it and it flies. The middle is hard to attain. I love/distrust this car and will probably trade before warranty expires."
car_954,Turbodiesel X5 Tops All Mid Size SUV's,I waited 6 months to write a review of the turbodiesel X5 to make sure that there would be no issues with the engine. There aren't any issues with the diesel - its great! Plenty of power on the low end with good power at speed. The six cylinder gas engine is way underpowered. The V8 has great performance with terrible fuel economy. I am getting between 30 and 32 MPG on the highway and 18 MPG in local driving. Figure that you will average 22 MPG in combined driving.
car_955,All that and more!  Really!,Feels rocket fast because of the low end torque. 0 to 60 is only 0.6 sec. slower then the gas guzzling 4.8 liter gasoline version. I average 22.4 mpg. and I drive it like a sports car. The comfort stability and ride quality still astound me. For the first time I always want to drive... and everyone else asks to. The thing corners like a sports car and feels soooo smooth doing 100mph on the straight.  Sound system is superb. You can hear the engine if the sound system is not on but it's not intrusive. I don't have the sport package with the expensive wheels so the visual is an understatement but the highway ride quality is actually a lot better without the fat tires...go figure.
car_956,"X5 Diesel Pros and Cons, mostly Pro","5,000 mile review: This vehicle is about compromise: V8 performance and SUV comfort with less pollution and  up to 30 mpg highway. But there's no mistaking that this is a diesel. You can hear the clatter at low RPM. BMW designed the X5 model with a loud exhaust note, mistakenly thinking that buyers equate noise with performance. Add the diesel's louder, gravelly engine note to the already loud X5 exhaust note and you get a noisy driving experience. It quiets down at highway speeds, but the exhaust noise is constant, intrusive, and can be annoying. In the first 5,000 miles, mpg was 24.5 mixed and 29.5 highway. Not bad for a vehicle that weighs over 2.5 tons and isn't broken in yet. This might be a good choice if you are willing to trade drive-train refinement for the comfort of an SUV that gets great mpg and pollutes less."
car_957,Love the X5!,"Just traded a 2008 Lexus LS460 sedan for my first SUV.  I love it so far!  Loaded with sport package, nav, comfort access, 20 inch wheels, you name it.  I have owned 2 BMW 5 series a few years back and frankly missed the German engineering... especially when compared to Lexus's poor engineering.  Sorry Lexus fans, but they just are not BMW's.  I actually look forward to getting up in the mornings just to drive my X5... that is how much i love it!  Let alone, the service and BMW assist is included for 4 years/50 K miles... that definitely helps with the ownership costs of a luxury SUV."
car_958,Fed up of inconsistent diagnostics,My BMW is under 6 months old with less than 4000 miles and has been back to the dealer for the same problem. It has an annoying vibrating sound from the engine. The dealer changed the power steering pump and problem still exists; now I am told it might be an engine mount. I would like to return this truck because I am fed up of the inconsistency of what a new car should have. I should have kept my infinti qx4.
car_959,Early impressions 100%,"I purchased a dealer demo with 8000 miles.  Paid $51K pre-tax, sticker of $63K, Invoice of $57K.  Included $4500 eco credit.  Dealer extended Warranty to 55,000 miles.  I have driven 3000 miles so far and can find nothing to fault.  Performance and handling is superb.  There is no turbo lag if you use kick-down mode or shift to M1 for quick starts. Hiway accel is gutsy, mind the staties.  I-Drive is easy to use, but it helps to practice when you are not driving.  The Nav is DVD based but terrific.  BMW Assist lets you download locations from Google Maps.  Cool.  I drive a lot in my job. Mileage averages 21mpg around New England and Boston. 27mpg on a long hiway trip at 75mph to 80mph."
car_960,Exceeded Expectations,"Car is very nice, great build quality, great mileage on the road, looks good, passengers and bystanders both seem to like it.  Driving comfort is impressive, 400 miles in the seat is nothing."
car_961,Mixed Thoughts,"The car drives and handles great. From a pure driving perspective, it is probably the best SUV I have ever had.  However, it has some serious flaws in the interior.  The navigation system is terrible and almost impossible to use.  The all in one computer system for using most features in the car is also not easy to use.  Something simple like changing the air from your head to your feet takes way too many steps to do.  The car just feels over engineered.  Also, don't believe the maintenance is included sales pitch.  I just got my 10,000 mile done and all it covered was an oil change and not rotating and balancing the tires."
car_962,Our first deisel & BMW,"Picked up a demo w/7500mi on it. Loaded with most options. The torque is plentiful, if switched to sport mode, it's even sweeter. Drove 1500+miles in 5 days and had no body aches. Very precise steering and fantastic brakes. The turning headlights and fog lights illuminate the roadway very well. Sound system is also amazing. This SAV is a blast to drive. It's my wife's so don't get to drive it much, but I feel good to have my family travel in this solid vehicle. Good crash ratings. Everyone says that the i-drive is a pain, however everything new in the world of electronics has a learning curve, once you master it, its all intuitive. Patience is a virtue. Lastly we got 27mpg on our road trip."
car_963,Great for long drives,"I just picked up my brand new X5 last month and I am very impressed with it so far. I drive 100+ miles per day so a comfortable ride is very important to me. I had my X5 built and I chose the ventilated seat package which was well worth it. The seats adjust in so many ways and the massage feature for the driver is great! My black sapphire X5 turns heads when its clean and the interior is impressive with the brushed aluminum trim giving it a sporty look. The driving position is great and the car is pretty quiet at 70-80mph on the highway. Also, the premium sound system upgrade sounds great and I also like the iPod interface. I would highly recommend this SUV."
car_964,I got what I hoped,"I have been researching an SUV (Landcruiser, Nissan Patrol, Discovery 3 or Bimmer) for 4 months and after a lot of deliberation went for the X5 turbo. I couldn't be more thrilled with what I got. The turbo is smooth and delivers great performance and yet is amazingly fuel efficient for a large vehicle. I'm 6'3"" and so there is plenty of space, great driving position and visibility. I had an E90 325 manual and the X5 isn't any slower and the handling isn't vastly different. My wife thought paying this much for a car ($90k Aussie) was ludicrous but she's already a convert - ""it's very comfortable isn't it??"" She never liked the 325. So I'm wrapped - so far anyway."
car_965,Very Happy with Diesel X5,This is my 6th X5 and probably my favorite. I like the idea of driving clean-diesel and a more fuel efficient SUV without much trade off in performance and comfort. Acceleration is excellent; it feels faster than performance numbers indicate. Diesel engine clatter does not intrude into the cabin; you would not know it's has a diesel engine from the interior. I custom order my BMWs and this one took only 9 days from production start to delivery.
car_966,X-5 Diesel,"Clean burn diesel engine and great fuel mileage, no black smoke or smell. A little bite noisy when standing by the car. When staying inside of the car, cannot tell the difference between gas and diesel engines! It is the first BMW I own. Hopefully the quality as good as Japanese products!"
car_967,Our First Diesel,"Purchased this as a demo vehicle, have put over 4000 miles on it so far.  The diesel is amazing.  This thing has power!  My wife drives it to work every day on the freeway, getting about 28mpg on the highway.  Our combined average is 24.5 (according to the computer).  Very comfortable to drive.  We do have the 3rd row seats and they are pretty useless except for kids under 12.  We checked out the VW Tourareg TDI as well and liked it too, very much.  Almost got it instead, but we got better financing through BMW Financial.  No regrets. Engine can use B5 biodiesel according to the manual, and I have been using that as well.  No issues. (I mix 100% biodiesel at 20:1 ratio with regular diesel)."
car_968,BMW X5 Diesel,"The diesel engine is perfect for this SUV.It is very solid and the transmission shifts smoothly. The ride is better than my previous SUV, a Mercedes ML500.  The iDrive is very frustrating and the navigation system is poor compared to the older Mercedes system, and can't begin to compete with a $200 Garmin.  There is no setting to automatically fold the power mirrors when locking the vehicle, and the front parking sensors are not full time - when pulling into my garage I must stop and push a button that also turns on the rear camera to check on the front. Amazingly, BMW does not include  floor mats as standard equipment and they must be purchased separately from the dealer."
car_969,Mixed feelings,"This is my first SUV, or should I say SAV... what got my attention at the dealership was the exterior styling of this vehicle. Also, having never owned a spacious and roomy vehicle, I thought it was time for a change. What I love about my new X5 is the driving position because you sit up very high and the car has very good visibility all around. I also love the panoramic sunroof. I am not sure how I feel about the leatherette seats... they feel kind of rubbery although they seem very durable. I must say the seats are extremely supportive on long trips and adjust in many ways.  I feel BMW should try to improve fuel economy in the gasoline engines as I did not want a diesel."
car_970,Love it but...,"While my 2009 X5 4.8i only has about 300 miles on it total I've got to say I wake up in the morning looking for places to go just so I can drive this awesome piece of machinery, and I work out of my house.  The Pros:  Awesome Handling, macho-good looks (especially with my 20"" y-spoke sport wheels), solid German engineering, thicker than average sporty steering wheel and powerful.  The Cons:  Beside the fact I have already had it in the shop for two full days due to two (conicidence? I think maybe not) bad front tires that was causing my car's steering to pull there aren't a whole lot of cons.  The i-Drive interface is a joke!  BMW has some work to do and could take some pointers from Lexus."
car_971,Even better than I first thought,"A brief update on my initial (3/1/09) review of my X5 diesel:  Now at 5,025 total miles.  Average mpg now 21.1 -  even though average speed is only 28.5 mph (most of my driving is urban, much of that on the very hilly streets of San Francisco).  Most impressive of all - not one single thing has needed repair or even minor adjusting.  This is a first for me. Over the years I've been fortunate to have only had brand new cars,  never used. One VW, one Lexus, five Mercedes, two Range Rovers, and one Toyota. Loved them all in one way or another, but all had needed overnight stays in the shop at least twice or more at this point in their lives.  A BMW, made in SC, tops them all - amazing."
car_972,X5 Turbo Diesel (no 3rd row seating),"Had a 3.0 X5.  Test drove Audi, Lexus, Acura, BMW gas, and fell for performance of X5 diesel.  After 7,000 miles I am actually trading it in for MB ML350 diesel.  BMW just not as comfortable.  Seats not as supportive. Engine can be too loud. Satellite radio comes & goes.  Passenger seat grinds/clicks when moved. Steering wheel squeaks when moved. Rt side speakers go dead on iPod integration.  Need to roll the window up/down a few times to get speakers back. Steering wheel does not telescope long enough for 6-1 height.  Engine performance is incredible.  Second seat leg room is great.  Cargo space is great. Just want more refinement.  Maybe I am getting old."
car_973,Vermillion Red-Liner,Bought a 09 Vermillion Red X5. These are rare and had to be custom ordered. I have owned X5's in the past and this is a great vehicle. It is fun to drive and handles great like a true BMW even though it's a heavy vehicle. It has all the options imaginable. Gas mileage is great for such a beast.
car_974,2009 BMW X5 4.8i,"The x5 is a great car, it has not broken down once. I am amazed it can do over 161 mph. It also has an amazing crash test rating."
car_975,"Very fun to drive, sucks gas","I got my X5 less than a week ago and I love it. I saw the 2010 iDrive on a couple of other BMW models. I became afraid that I bought too soon before the 2010's came out. Hey this car handles awesome and is super comfortable. The fat wheel looks burly. I like the electronics and computer stuff. Sound system is way better than I expected, and I am a picky guy. I'm tired of Mercedes Benz and the way they treated me. When I got the X5 my blackberry connected easily with the bluetooth. With Mercedes, blue tooth only worked with Motorola and Verizon. That stinks, they went out of their way to make things more expensive and harder. BMW beats Mercedes in handling and steering in my book. Bye bye BENZ."
car_976,Is this a SUV?,"I traded my Mercedes GL450 because we wanted something slightly smaller, but not give up the utility, and luxury-comfort. The X5 hits that mark perfectly. It has sporty handling but is still luxurious and quiet. Gets 20 MPG which is great in my book. I'm 6'4"" and 300 lbs and am super comfortable in it, and... my kids have room in the second seats!"
car_977,3rd X5 - X5 35d Best SUV & Great MPG,"This is my 3rd X5, my X5 35d has less features than my last one... I wanted the 35d and didn't want to order.  I get 20 mpg in town, going long distance 35mpg.  Great torque, better going uphill than gas engine.  Better blue-tooth than previous years, have to let computer system boot...gives chance for car to warm up.  Get Rear- Climate package...didn't get like past X5s...should have been patient and waited.  My wife will be getting one when her 335 lease is up.  2 SUV family...best value and drive in its class.  Must get running boards to finish off the look."
car_978,For Sure the Ultimate Driving Machine!,"My 2nd X5 4.8i and I love it! Lots of power, response, comfort..and a head turner. Got the loaded 4.8i, custom order, Black Sapphire, Saddle Brown Leather, loaded, 20s, it's sweet! Quality machine, could drive it for hours!"
car_979,BMW 35d,"I bought the 35d last week it is a great car, fun to drive and the interior is elegant yet contemporary.  The I drive with noted improvements, is still cumbersome and I have to duck my head to get into the vehicle.  The windshield is swept a bit too far back creating an entry obstacle. However I still highly recommend this vehicle as it is state of the art and well worth the price! Driving is a pleasure, the turbo diesel is responsive and zippy!  Ride is all you would expect from a car of this caliber. Cup holders are positioned well and there are plenty of auxiliary electronics ports. My wife doesn't care for the engine vibration at idle. The passenger climate controls are great."
car_980,X5 diesel review,The SUV while a little noisy outside is extremely quiet inside and comfortable with excellent power and very good fuel mileage.
car_981,Best Green SUV,"I've led a double life for years. I'm a committed environmentalist,  and at the same time I'm an SUV lover. I love SUV's because I'm 6'4"", I'm claustrophobic, and I have a kid, dogs and a horse so I need to be able to haul a lot of gear. But I also totally believe that if we can't all reduce our carbon footprint our children's children will face some huge problems. So,  two years ago I traded in my Range Rover for a Mercedes ML 500, and last month I traded that in for the new BMW X5 diesel. I got 12 MPG with the Range Rover,  15.5 with the ML 500 (both on premium),  and so far (after 650 miles) I am getting 20.1 mpg on the X5. Not as good as a Prius,  BUT WAY BETTER TO DRIVE."
car_982,Dead Battery,"Huge problem with the battery system.  The push start system has no accessory mode, therefore if the engine is not running and you turn it on to use the radio, phone, DVD, etc.  The battery will drain in 15 minutes.  No indicator, no warning, just dead battery.  The dealer service departments say they have to put the car on a charger just to work on them or the battery will be dead.  The BMW answer is you have to have the engine running ""all the time"".  Forget the after engine turnoff heat, you can't use it.  Forget the DVD player that logically you can't use while driving, but you have to keep the engine running.  If you expect to use your car a lot like I do, forget it."
car_983,Finally!,"I've been a long time Porsche/BMW/Mercedes driver and this is by far the best all around vehicle I have ever owned. I enjoyed my M3/997 more from a pure driver's standpoint but I can actually carry my dry cleaning home now. The new X5 is a terrific package and the diesel power plant completes it nicely. I have wanted a proper diesel power plant in a daily driver for some time now as the advantages during a daily commute are obvious: torque while being fuel efficient and low rev requirements to get the job done. It feels as quick as the V8 powered X5, however provides guilt free driving while in view of my Sierra Club neighbors."
car_984,The Best SUV/SAV Money Can Buy,"2010 X5 has the shortest turning radius in its class, excellent diesel fuel economy, much improved iDrive system, and very comfortable/luxurious interior.  We have 3 BMWs in our family, and the X5 is the most comfortable one by far.  The only thing I'm worried about is BMW's reliability issue down the road such as window regulators, fuel pump, and cooling system, I think an extended warranty will come in handy."
car_985,Top of the line,"I love my brand new 2010 BMW x5 4.8. I can't get tired of driving it, it handles like a sports car and rides like a sports car too. The 3 row seating not worth the money, did not get - can only fit small kid, very small. Everything else I love."
car_986,2010 BMW,We have had our X5d for 2 months now and love it! After the first week we took it on a test drive to Las Vegas and it performed beautifully. My wife went thru the owners manual figuring out how everything works and we were able to figure out all the features that we use without much trouble. The owners manual is great and easy to follow. So far it is just what we were looking for and the diesel is great. No more smog checks! Can't beat the power and economy of a diesel.
car_987,BMW X5 Diesel,"Bought the car 10 days ago. Love it so far (never spent this much on a car). Engine is fantastic, seems really solid, and the gas mileage appears legit so far. We have 3 kids under 11, and it probably isn't the best family car in terms of space (compared to a minivan), but we did it anyway since it's so much fun."
car_988,Finally a High Performance Diesel,"What a great road machine. Typically amazing BMW handling with an torquey (425 ft. lb.) diesel to slice through traffic and pull you down the open road. This machine not only has great performance and luxury, it also is a very low emission (check the white glove tail pipe test) high efficiency engine that exceeds 25 mpg on the highway. I can start this vehicle in my garage with the door closed and have literally NO diesel odor after warming up for several minutes. The engine has a nice growl at idle that fades to barely perceptible at highway speeds. The fit and finish are perfect and with the technology package the is little left to ask for in terms of amenities. Many 1,000 mile trips ahead."
car_989,BMW is Spot On,"I have had my 2010 X5 35d for ten days now.  The first thing to note is that BMW has finally got the iDrive system correct.  This version is the best system of this kind I have seen (I have the Toyota and Acura navs also).  The diesel is getting over 31mpg on the highway and 23.5mpg in and around town.  That is on my second tank.  The fit and finish are flawless.  Acceleration is excellent.  The Parking Assist system is extremely good and may be the best feature.  I struggled with what to purchase, I made the right decision.  I even avoided the 2009 X5 knowing the iDrive was going to be improved - WOW did it."
car_990,One of a kind vehicle,"Simply put, there is nothing like this vehicle in the market in 2009-2010. Name another vehicle that rockets from 0 to 60 in less than 7 seconds and gets 32 MPG on the freeway! No short cuts in manufacturing, unmatched interior quality, exceptional handling and lots more. Don't try to save money on the options. This car should be had with all the bells and whistles. Well worth the investment. Tried all the competitors. None impressed me as much as this car. Have had it for a week now and have to say that the car delivers on the promise!"
car_991,Not worth the hype! (if there is any),"I should have waited.  Interior is still boring, NAV is still a pain, gas mileage is much worse than posted, turning radius is one of the worst in its mid-size SUV class, and there is so much more to dislike."
car_992,This Diesel ROCKS!!!!,"The diesel engine is truly the best everyday engine for this SUV. If you are test driving one of these, put the transmission in ""DS"" and 6th gear at about 40 mph and hit the throttle! The torque moves this vehicle with authority that the gas (non x5M) engines just cannot muster. I managed 27.9 mpg on a 175 mile trip which beats a coworker's Lexus RX400 hybrid and the x5 is much more engaging to drive than the RX. I may be in the minority, but I think the diesel engine sound is pretty cool and I dig the sound when accelerating with the windows down. You will turn some heads in parking lots when they hear that growl and turbo spool up."
car_993,Great Diesel SUV,A great car with very good handling. Do not feel like driving a big vehicle. Awesome performance. The iDrive is good. The parking feature is fantastic. Mileage is good so far. We just ordered and got it a week ago. The panoramic moon roof is cool. The dashboard and the new Navigation system (hard drive based) are very user friendly. Very sharp steering and fantastic brakes!!! Definitely a very nice car and worth the price we paid for it.
car_994,Great Car,"This is a brand new 2010 X5 35D and it is awesome. The handling is very good. iDrive is fantastic and the navigation panel is very user friendly. There is nothing to complain about this car. Definitely a good purchase for the price. The parking feature is extremely good. When you press the parking switch when you are driving all the cameras around the car would turn and it clearly shows you whether you parked on the side line etc., it is cool, pick up is very good, brakes are very sharp."
car_995,Best SUV in it's class,Great SUV
car_996,Beautiful but it's the last US made BMW I'll get,"I will start by saying that I consider my self a BMW enthusiast. This is my 5th BMW and sadly my first review, were I feel compelled to put out there, what my disappointments have been. I understand that one can be the unlucky bearer of a rare lemon. However the abysmal difference of expiereiences with this, my first US made BMW makes me believe that there could be fundamental quality control differences between plants. Here is what went wrong: loud ringing on the right-rear column (4 visits to repair), transmission box failure (1 visit, but the engine sounds funny, when going up a hill, ever since), cargo door would open on its own (3 visits where I was mostly blamed for ""inadvertently hitting the open button"", until on the 4th visit, they found that there was in deed an issue), failure of the soft-locking mechanism (this being the worst of all issues, as the doors would open by themselves while the vehicle was being operated!!). I swear this to be true. It took 4 visits as well, where BMW service centers would refuse to fix the problem since they had to ""witness"" the issue happening. The challenge being that if the episodes would happen at random, the service tecnitians could not drive around the car for days until they actually saw the phenomenon happen. So of course, as a customer, to have to deal with the disbelief of the dealerships, while being forced to drive around when doors can open at any time, is beyond frustrating. I believe that BMW still makes very good product, but I have moved my vote of no confidence in the North Carolina quality control and for the first time in 15 years, I steered off from BMW SUV's."
car_997,Bummer is Best,"This is the Best SAV that I have owned to date. Reliability, safety and resale value is important to me and this stands true with this X5!"
car_998,A Refined Step up from prior X5s - Legendary BMW,"We replaced a 2007 X5 4.8i with the new 2014 X5 sDrive 35i model year and it is a much improve vehicle.  Key areas of improvements for us are:1) Idrive & Connect Technology - Voice command is incredibly accurate and easy to use.2)  Interior quality & refinement.  Seats, instrument cluster and leather dash are higher quality material & overall design.3) Ride comfort & Handling.  You can still feel and have the legendary BMW style handling and road manners, but harshness is all but gone, as compared to 2007 model year.  The car feels much lighter and agile than the previous model.4) LED Headlights are impressive in looks, brightness and visibility while driving at night."
car_999,Best X5 Ever,The new X5 is a delight to drive and is truly beautiful inside. The performance ride and handling are awesome.  Test drove the Porsche Cayenne and ML. BMW is hands down the best for me.
car_1000,5.0 vs 3.5 no comparison,"We test drove the 3.5 and loved the styling.  The car handled and had acceptable acceleration but felt heavy.  When looking at the weight, I knew that having the 5.0 engine would make all the difference in the world.  Well when I went down to test drive it… words can’t describe it.  Many people say “I don’t get it”…  I can tell you, get behind the wheel and you “Will Get It!”.  I know it’s not for everyone and honestly, that was a whole level beyond why I wanted it.  In the three months I’ve had it, I’ve only seen 3 on the road.  I can’t count the FX, ML’s, RX’s, and Cayenne’s.  There is a sense of exclusivity that comes with owning one.  If you don’t like attention, don’t by an X6."
car_1001,Awesome for Foursome,"Got every available option on my X6, and I am loving it!  Don't confuse this car with an SUV; it is a Sports Activity Coupe with room for any foursome (golf, tennis, skiing, or dating)and all the accompanying equipment (clubs, rackets, skis, and luggage).  My grandson can even watch movies in the back seat!  Just got mine back from BMW Collision after rear ending a Cadillac sedan.  Awesome collision safety behavior from the car with only frontal damage while the Cadillac regretfully was demolished. The repair by BMW looks amazing!"
car_1002,BMW X6 X-cellent,"Having owned the Range Rover Supersport supercharged and Audi q7, I can say that this car exceeds all of these on every front for driving pleasure and fun without giving ground, except for serious off roading. The twin turbo is very responsive and returns good mileage. Handling is incredible for a  car of this type. Space is very good at 6'4"" no problem in finding a very comfortable seating position, even the back seats are good for a 6' person. Overall very solid just what you expect."
car_1003,BMW X6 a Hit !,"A great look and glad we bought instead of Infiniti FX35, which is likely a good car. Outside lines turn heads, interior is comfortable. Can go to the snow. Hwy mileage is 22+, around town is low 15. Very fast for 6 cyl. Very solid. We own 06 Denali, so don't expect it to tow, haul huge loads, etc. We are new empty nesters and this car fits our needs very well and better for us than X 5. Rear view has not been a problem for us. took couple in back seats and they said they were comfortable. Great car!"
car_1004,Flashy headache,"Sure, it gets attention, but I wish more attention had been given to practical design.  It's nearly impossible to see out of the rear window making reverse a dangerous exercise.  The rear view camera display states to ""never rely solely on camera"" when that's exactly what the driver must do.  Side vision is also hampered by the steep drop off of the front fenders--the driver can't tell see the outboard edge of the car.  The liftgate has two opening heights, but getting past the low one is fiddly at best, making loading anything back there a long reach into a shallow slit opening.  Super- expensive tires.  People will look at you, alright, but I'd rather the car be more user friendly."
car_1005,A Definite Head Turner,"This is my 3rd BMW, but my first new BMW and will not be my last.  I have never been in a vehicle that has turned more heads and make even other luxury car owners smile and give me the ""Big Thumbs Up!"" The Interior is nice and roomy, the controls are logically laid out, and the car is just a dream to drive."
car_1006,Love the Ride,"Gotta say, I was thinking of an AWD vehicle after living in Illinois and having a 550i that was fun to drive in the summer, but in Chicago winters a bear to control. I was in the market for AWD w/o the boxy look. I walked into the showroom and they were unloading it from the semi-trailer. I fell in love with the shape and the wide stance. I can also say it chews up the curves and has been a definite attention getter. To becoming almost an annoyance. I feel like a rock star when I'm behind the wheel. The ride height is perfect and the handling is superb. Needs a little more pep in the 6 cylinder."
car_1007,SUV on steriods!,"BMW's first SUV that drives like a sports car. Despite the sacrifice of the utility aspect, the SAV is a heavy, well build automobile with sufficient twin turbo engine, and impressive handling, performance and spacious comfort for four. There are numerous high-tech gadgets and functions in the car to entertain you and make you feel real good. The drawbacks: no utility/no space, gas-guzzler even for the V6, pricey when equipped fully, the navigation dvd processor is too noisy, and finally the design attracts too much attention. If you can afford one go for it. I'm enjoying mine."
car_1008,Update: Just what I wanted,"I was in error when I submitted my original review.  The X6 does have the TPM standard, I just was not used to the IDrive and the TPM function is ""greyed out"" (not accessible) when the car is off.  I was playing with all the settings without the car running so that's why it did not show up. I did have a computer glitch, warning me that the AWD and DSC, DBS and startoff assist had malfunctioned. Problem was  a $20 brake relay swith that was sending a wrong signal.  Dealership fixed it and everthing has been fine since.  Still love the car and a definite head turner!"
car_1009,Just what I wanted!,"I have had 3 X5s and used to drive sports cars prior to that.  As much as I loved the X5, I still missed the ""coupe"" look and feel.  And then the X6 came along.  Exactly what I wanted.  I still cannot wipe that smile off my face every time I look at it or get behind the wheel.  What a car, the engine is fantastic, the handling superb and I just can't rave enough about the outside look.  I have not been this excited about a car since my 1993 Acura Legend coupe with 6 speed manual transmission. I ordered mine to have exactly what I wanted and the 3 weeks it took before I got the car seemed like and eternity!"
car_1010,"More fun, better looking than the X5","Very happy with the X6 after almost 2 months. I love the handling with the sport package; much improved over my 2007 X5 4.4i. No reliability problems yet. Definitely a head turner and I enjoy the convenience of an SUV without the boxy SUV reputation. The turbo six performs as well as the V-8 in the 4.8i X5, but gets significantly better gas mileage. I didn't want to wait a few months for availability of the turbo V-8, but at current gas prices, the turbo six is an adequate choice. You just have to push it a little harder."
car_1011,A fun vehicle to drive,"I just trade in the 2006 530Xi wagon, love this vehicle, fun to drive, have the SUV high command feeling, but with good road performance. Now I hate my 07 Escalade."
car_1012,FUN!,"I have an X5 and quite happy with it. I took a test drive of X6-35i and was very impressed with its handling of curves, uphill pickup and the interior. It is a pricy toy! Question is less room than X5 but more fun."
car_1013,Simply Amazing!,"My last car was a Mercedes -- hated it with a passion. The BMW 528i I had previously driven for years felt sturdier and safer than the Mercedes! So I chucked the Mercedes and bought the X5. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Mileage stinks but you expect that with a 4.8L engine right? Otherwise, it's a great car that drives like a sports car and yet it's luxury all the way!"
car_1014,It's not a 330i but...,"Went from a 2001 BMW X5 to a BMW 330i and now back to a 2009 X5.  Needed the X5 to pull a boat, which it does with ease.  The 2009 is much improved over the 2001 in terms of build quality.  The 2001 X5 did have mechanical issues.  I do miss the handling of the 330i but for a SUV, the 2009 X5 is as close as it gets!"
car_1015,Nothing Better,"I typically do not drive much. However, this X5 really makes you want to go out there and just ride. Everything about it is satisfying. The color I got was dark blue (monaco) with the saddle brown leather and it is just amazing. After tinting the windows I plan on putting the new BMW 21"" 215 wheels in ferric grey! Amazing."
car_1016,2009 BMW X5 35d BiTurboDiesel,"I am driving the all new 2009 X5 diesel since one month, approx. 1000 miles. Before I drove already the X5 3.0 I6 cylinder for 2 years and the X5 4.4 V8. The diesel engine fits that car best!! The torque is huge - no difference to the V8. The mileage is about 25 mpg, even in those days extreme winter temperatures. By the way I didn't had any winter problems so far.  The 2008/2009 update to the X5 is significant to the older models, e.g. more space in back row and trunk. Also remote trunk opener, keyless comfort entry, rear view camera are nice features. I love my all new X5 35d."
car_1017,2009 X5 35D,"Diesel mpg averages 28-30 at 60-70mph, in town I am getting about 22 mpg. I was worried about the iDrive, but it works great once you understand it. The voice navigation is best I have used. Power tailgate sounds flimsy, but works. Power is awesome from the 3.0 diesel, frugal yet powerful. I was concerned about ride with runflats, but so far just seems a little stiff."
car_1018,Diesel: Who Knew?,"The X5 Diesel is a phenomenal vehicle.  It handles and rides like a dream.  The gadgets are the best quality, and the ride and efficiency are true BMW.  I don't want another SUV."
car_1019,The Ultimate Driving Machine is a Dream,"This is my first BMW.  I compared it with '09 Acura MDX, '09 Lexus GX470 and '09 Infiniti FX50.  I found myself coming to BMW X5 after test driving all the other SUVs in its class.  I loved the fact that BMW covers all maintenance for four years which the others do not.  This SUV has everything looks, speed, wow factor.  I love the iPod integration, navigation is very easy to use, I love asking for options in any menu and then I know exactly what to say to get anything done via Voice commands.  The fuel economy could be better but if you can spend $$$ for the BMW then gas is not a big deal for you.  I love driving my Ultimate Driving Machine it drives like a dream!"
car_1020,Excellent,"Just picked up my ordered BMW X5 xDrive35d (diesel) that I had ordered back in August 2008. Ordered every option possible (costly). It was worth the wait. The diesel is very quite and drives like a dream. The torque is huge and available at any speed. The twin turbo diesel engine does a magnificent job. There is absolutely no lag at all. You punch it, and it goes. With that much power, you really do not need the big 4.8i. I was debating between the diesel and the 4.8i for the longest time, but now I am very glad that I went for the diesel. Picked up the x5 2 weeks ago with a full tank. Drove 500 km and still have more that quarter tank of fuel left. Fuel mileage, so far so good."
car_1021,Best Bimmer Ever,"Have driven many BMWs, Porsches, etc.This is the best combo of sport, fun, function, power, looks, and exclusivity.Practical?I coach baseball and this car handles all my gear.Having had many sport sedans includeing 535, 335, etc, somehow this car handles better and feels more aggressive.Ride is comfy, but torque and turn-in are there when you want some.Cabin is like a 7 series, the environment is truly sublime on a freezing day within about 30 seconds of ignition."
car_1022,Life Saver,"I purchased my 2009 BMW X6 last November and drove it all thru the winter season.  I put at least 25k miles on a year so comfort was a huge decision-maker when I decided on the X6.  No complaints other than expensive tired to replace when you get a nail in one...but they look incredible.  This vehicle did save my life as I was hit head on going 45MPH on a state highway.  While the vehicle was totaled, it held up tremendously with only a few bumps and bruises from the accident.  I will only buy BMW from this date forward.  I am currently waiting for a new BMW X6 to arrive."
car_1023,Best car...,"This is by far the most fun car I have ever driven. Except that every 4000 miles on the dot the fuel pressure pump dies. Apparently it is a problem with CA gas additives that BMW is still trying to fix on the 3.5L engines. However even with the hassle, most dealers were quick to fix the car and get it back on the road and BMW is standing behind their car to the point of taking it back and replacing it no questions asked. That is why we love BMW."
car_1024,Awesome Performance... Awesome Looks,"By Far the BEST BMW I have driven yet... had two X5s and a 328ix. I got Black Sapphire on Black...loaded...The X6 3.5i has lots of power, is good looking (a real head turner), rides like a car, sportiness of a coupe, and utility of an SUV. Quality build, quality ride and a really fun to drive! Get one....it's worth it!"
car_1025,BWM X6 35i,"Between my wife and I, we have owned every BMW except a Z and this vehicle is by far the most fun to drive.  Love the space and neat style. One friend after seeing it called it the batmobile.  Just picked it up yesterday and can't wait to go for a ride today. I can't image how fast the 50i must be."
car_1026,Great Whatever it is,"Love the X6 - I think it's worth the extra $$ for the V8 - plus residuals are better and the money factors were too. Only wishes would be:  1. Manual transmission Option (Are you listening BMW!!)  2.  5th seat - middle seat in back, and 3.  Handles above seats.  I know it's supposed to be a ""coupe"" but c'mon, we need handles.   I get more ""stares"" in this rig than I did in my M6 convertible.  It surprisingly also feels faster than that vehicle.  Fun car/SUV, whatever it is I love it."
car_1027,Great Car - Eats Gas,"Handles really well and is extremely comfortable, with room for kids, dog and luggage. Great family car with a lot more sport than an SUV, previously had an X5 and this blows the X5 away. Downside is that it eats gas voraciously. Highly recommend for low mileage driver - not an everyday commuter car unless you like supporting the local gas station."
car_1028,Great All-Around Vehicle,"After 2 months and 2,000 miles I can say that this is the most exciting BMW I have owned.  The last two were sedans that drove great.  But, didn't have that extra factor that makes a car unique.  The X6 has that factor.  Incredible road manners, great aspect from all seating positions, incredible comfort and the best build quality in years for BMW."
car_1029,X6 3.5i and 5.0i Sport,"As owner of a car dealership I have the advantage of driving everything available in South Africa. So we owned a Q7 and a Range Rover Sport amongst others. We own a 2008 X6 3.5i sport and loved the driving comfort, handling and general driving pleasure so much that I just bought myself a X6 5.0i sport. For me, being a lover of sport cars, this is the real deal. It's like owning a sports car on steroids. We agree out of all cars we enjoy these two cars the most! So, wife drives one and I drive one, because not much else appeals so much. So, no matter what people say about the looks, fuel consumption and so on, go drive the thing and you will be hooked too. Happy driving!"
car_1030,Lovin' it,Wanted to get up higher in traffic for visibility so went looking at crossovers and SUVs.  Test drove the X5 and the X6.   NO CONTEST.  The X6 has sedan like handling characteristics and had better performance.  There really IS a difference between the X5's 3.0i and the X6's 3.5i.
car_1031,"Not a ""me too"" SUV","Wanted to get into an SUV, but not one that looked like all the others.  Even the X5 reminds me of a Ford Explorer.  The X6 fits the bill in every way.  Fun to drive, great to look at, and plenty of room to haul home swap meet and mall purchases."
car_1032,Real Excitement,"I waited for one year to upgrade my car X5 to X6. We drive long distance at the weekends. We had very good time with our X5. But driving a X6 is a Real Excitement. Our car is xDrive 35d which has 6 cylinders-turbo charged diesel engine delivering 293 HP. I drive very comfortable and feeling very secure with this car due to its safety features and control systems. we like its outer design which is different than regular cars. It also has an excellent interior design. Bottom line, it was worth waiting for a year."
car_1033,What was I thinking?,"It is far too expensive.  Acura MDX is half the cost and, although not as fast, a better car.  I hope I grow to like it, but right now I can't help but thinking that I could have had more for so much less!!!"
car_1034,Best Lux Crossover Out There,"Just picked up my 2009 X6 35i and am loving it. Lots of people don't understand why this vehicle exists but it has everything I personally look for in an everyday driver.  I've got utility when I need it with plenty of cargo room for a weekend ski trip, no kids yet to worry about messing up my nappa leather, physics defying handling for an SUV that must be experienced to be believed, a peppy engine that begs to be put in sport mode and thrashed, BMW quality/service/maintenance, great sound system (cool seeing your ipod tunes integrated into the audio system), the latest technology and something you won't pull up next to 5 of at the local supermarket. I can't wait to drive again in the morn!"
car_1035,In A Class By Itself,"Of all the xDrive BMWs I've owned or even driven, this one is a sublime blend of sure footed panther and raging bull. Fit and finish is above even BMW standards. It feels like it's hand made on the inside and looks like it was left behind by advanced intelligence from another galaxy.  Drove both engine sizes and went with the big one 5.0 V-8. The roar alone justified my decision. The slack-jaw looks it earns from the ignoratii are priceless.  Forget about cargo space. This is not for soccer moms. This is for a single individual to get out and have fun quickly. Sport package is a must on this car. So is Technology package. Logic 7 premium sound is a hedge against any conversation. Get 1"
car_1036,Early review at 1240 miles,"Bought this car 1240 miles ago.  Best handling SUV that I've driven to date. I am 6-2, and having to drive from DC to Richmond VA at least once a week for work makes sedans and other lower riding cars tiring on my legs/back. Thus, was looking for an SUV not for cargo space or off-roading, but for the ride and seat height.  With sports package, it is a blast to drive, especially considering its height and weight. It corners better than my '06 TL, though some of it is due to the massive 20"" 315 tires on the X6. Suspension is on the firmer side, but supple enough, once again especially for an SUV. Compared against MDX, FX50, FX35, X5, ML550, narrowed down to X5 vs. X6, and picked this."
car_1037,Worst Car I have Ever Had,"The BMW X6 i50 was the worst car I have ever had.  If you’re thinking about buying one you better buy a fire extinguisher and a few cases of oil.  I bought a Vermelain Red Black interior 2012.  Loved the car at the time.  Paid big bucks, everything at BMW is a “package”.  I like to keep my cars – not this one.  I had it about a month and it had a chassis malfunction. No one could figure out what that was and the problem came and went.  Then there was an indicator for “increased battery discharge”.  The dealer changed cables etc., I brought it in about 4 times then demanded a new battery which I got.  Then the indicator said “high battery drain”.  Fed up at this point I waited until the car had to go in for the next service.  When I brought it in they wouldn’t release the car back.  The keyless system was somehow communicating with the battery and the car was ready to go on fire.  Around the same time about 5,000 miles the car is asking for oil.  They said that’s all normal wait until it hits 15,000 miles.  15,000 miles came and went the car needed a quart of oil every 5000 miles.  The need for oil then started to increase as the mileage continued to increase.  Eventually, every 900 miles the car needed oil.  BMW insisted that was all normal.  I wrote to Germany (in German) they referred the problem to BMW North America.  They sent a service technician to look at the vehicle – said it was all normal.  I was the one topping off the oil not BMW.  Then they told me they wanted me to go to the dealer every time it needed oil.  Really! – I drive over a 100 miles a day.  The dealer is about 2 hours away round trip.  I would waste 2 hours every 2 weeks on oil!  Beyond that, BMW did nothing.  At approximately 50,000 miles it didn’t seem to have the drive or acceleration intensity that is used to have; it couldn’t get out of it’s own way.  The dealer said it was normal.  The next visit for service not long after the complaint of lack of acceleration – eureka it’s leaking oil and the turbos need rebuilding (which was another 6 weeks at the dealer).  That was fixed I drive into my driveway to see the “oil” light go on again – back to the dealer I go.  After all that the car did regain its acceleration that it should have.  Now 5 years later I am still putting a quart of oil in the car every 900 miles.  It needs brakes (normal maintenance), turbos either need to be rebuilt or replaced, and the I Drive is playing games.  You put it on one thing and it changes itself to another.  Using an independent mechanic certified in BMW who doesn’t charge like a dealer the cost of this vehicle to keep for 1 year has been $10,000.  After paying $90,000 for a vehicle you would expect a lot more from the car, the dealer and BMW – you get nothing from any of them.  Now do you want to do that – me either it’s traded never to be purchased again!"
car_1038,X6M Great Vehicle!,"Ideal vehicle,  SUV with Sports Car performance."
car_1039,2012 BMW X6 50i,This car is very nice. The ride is more sport than luxury as one would expect from a BMW. The interior is well thought out and the controls are very easy to use. The 8 cyl engine gives incredible power! Love the side sun shades! 10 way adjustable seats are incredible. One thing to investigate if looking to purchase is oil consumption! Twin turbo seems to consume an unusual amount of oil! I've investigated issue through forums and BMW service. 1 quart per 2-3 thousand miles supposedly is within BMW guidelines. Some mechanics say this is crazy some say this is normal. The car monitors engine oil level with an easy to read picture. Topping off oil is very easy to do. I would not purchase this car without a warranty! Having owned several BMWs I would not want to reach into my pocket for even the simplest of repairs. Very good in the snow. Run flats have come down in price so tire purchase is acceptable. Please note if replacing tired get ready to purchase all for at one time! Tire wear between tired has to be within a certain range or damage to crankcase can occur.  Forget replacing two!
car_1040,X 6 3.5 Sport Package,"I have had 3 previous X 5 models. The x6 is a different vehicle. It's wider,bolder, and more of a stylistic statement.I got the sport package with 20's, which make the car look very pumped up. With these wheels and sport package be prepared for a very harsh ride if the road is rough, but you will look great bouncing over the bumps. Its much rougher than an X5. The wide cabin and big seats are great. I love the design. Feels quick with the 6.Great power train and transmission. It's Only a 4 passenger, but you will ride in style.Rear visibility ok with the camera. King of the road feel and looks to match."
car_1041,Love my new BMW!,I love this car more than my X-5. I didn't need the wagon but wanted the size of the car.It is a joy to drive.
car_1042,"""The ultimate driving machine"" - True .","The ""Good"" Kept the car for 3 yrs, and it was great. The body is hard and does not ding easy like the Japanese cars.  REALLY nice power and transmission and handling. . Climate control and ambiance lighting is great. The navigation is also great.  No mechanical problems at all.  The bad: The central air vent does not reach high enough to blow air on the driver's face.  The brake squeak at times.  Outside of that the car has been amazing that I could not part with it at the end of the lease.  So I purchased it ."
car_1043,My bmw,I love this car
car_1044,A Disgrace to BMW,"When I first bought this car I thought that it would be a great car. Once I took delivery of the car everything seemed great and perfect. Everything was great the driving the ac. Everything seemed great until exactly a week of driving it that morning I wanted to get into the car but it wouldn't open, so I called roadside assistance they sent a flatbed truck who then jump started the car so then I drove it to the dealership. I gave the dealership the car they told me they were going to fix it after four days they told me to come pick it up when I went to pick it up they told me that there was something wrong with the battery drainage and when I got into the car it said battery failure so I gave it back to them. Then it took them five days to fix it again and every time I called them they would ignore me then it took along time to get it fixed and it didn't get fixed so I gave it back to the dealer which was very hard to give it back to them because they just wanted the money to stay with them. The car turned out to be a lemon and then I felt good that I returned it because if I kept it I would've been keep taking it to them over and over. I wonder how much the ""repairs"" costed if they weren't covered under the warranty. This car gave a terrible review of BMW and I think they should check their cars better at the factory."
car_1045,2015 X5 3.5 Diesel. MSport,"Great gas mileage and Road handling. Steering feel is a little bit vague compared to the older BMW's. But steering feel is still better than most other SUVs ...other than the Cayenne. Tech package is great. Screen can't be stowed, but can be turned off.  The other reviewer needs to read the owner's manual it's really quite simple. Lots of storage and the noise level is very quiet on the highway. Not a cheap car but you get what you pay for and it's definitely more reliable than the Porsche.    Almost 2 years in and no issues to report. Still happy, with the decision.  However, California/ Jerry Browns ridiculous new diesel gas tax is making fuel more expensive than planned... hopefully that will be overturned..."
car_1046,fun to drive!  the 8 cyl engine is awesome.,"2 negatives.  Why do I have to push the stop button twice to turn off the car?  And the BSM stinks, why does it only come on at 30mph and put the indicator on the mirror.  topview is my favorite feature.  Great for parking"
car_1047,Good hauler,"Replacing an E350 wagon is hard, since we still need cargo hauling space and enough back seat room for three teens.  Although the X3 had better handling, we couldn't give up the cargo space, so the X5 is the solution for the next 3 years.  Only wish I could turn off or stow the nav/radio screen.  It's distracting, especially at night."
car_1048,In the shop after 600 miles,I purchased  an x5 35d and after 600 miles the check engine light came on. Took it to the dealer and it was determined that it has a faulty sensor. But because it's a diesel they don't stock the part. It's been three days and still waiting.
car_1049,"Almost Perfect Car, has a few quirks though...","This is a brand-new car for me and the year or so I've owned it now I have to say that the reliability has been fantastic so far.  No problems to speak of, drove a lot (15,000 miles so far), had one service, and still going strong.THE GOOD STUFF:As far as a driving machine goes this car is very hard to fault.  Coming from a manual transmission car I was afraid I was going to lose some of that sporty fun of shifting gears, but this has a very good select-shift automatic that is fast and doesn't nanny you too bad.  The push forward for downshifts and push back for upshifts is also more akin to racing cars, which is great.  The MOST amazing thing about this car is definitely the fuel efficiency.  For my mix of commuting of road trips, I'm averaging about 26 mpg, which is about the same I got with my old Mark V GTI, which is a 4-cylinder compact car.  The fact that I can get that kind of mpg of a car so heavy and powerful is nothing short of amazing.  A large thanks to this is the 8 speed transmission, which barely spins the engine when you are in top gear on the highway and still lets you have some low-end power for gentle passing.  Besides that it holds corners very well, brakes well, and acceleration is very strong when you need it.  It'll happily cruise at around 80-90 mph and when passing it'll reach up to 115 or so without much trouble.  One of my favorite things is that when you are in drive and push shifter to the manual mode, it'll automatically shift down two gears as though it knows you are trying to pass on a narrow road.  Even in Comfort mode the ride is quite firm.  A lot of people associate ""luxury"" cars with plush rides and supreme quiet.  This is not that car, this is for someone who enjoys driving and feeling the road for sure.  It's a refined ride for sure, so you don't feel fatigued even after many hours of driving.  It's also got a huge gas tank so you don't have to stop and fill up too often (~5oo miles per fillup) The steering is electric and takes some getting used to I thing, but once you do, you don't really think about it's little weirdnesses too much.  The space is immense and it has a lot of storage for items and various small knickknacks.Besides that It's got all the standard luxury car fare like rain sensing wipers, bright headlights, seat memory, electronic trunk close, backup camera and all that.  They all work as they should, but the seat memory is particularly notable in that it memorizes the position of the side mirrors as well, which I feel is the most difficult thing to get right.THE BAD:For as much as I like the car, there are a few things that are annoying.  The first is the looks, while I like it, I liked the previous generation better, it was more aggressive and masculine.  The 2015 one looks a little more subdued and feminine.  The driving is great, but it's so heavy and has so many gears that the engine braking is not great on moderate downhills.  The only other thing I wish could be improved with the driving experience are the automatic headlights.  It seems to come on when it is almost totally dark, I wish it would come on sooner.  I've also yet to find a why to prevent the air conditioning to stop turning itself on when you start the car on a hot day.  This means I'm constantly turning it off.  Like many German cars, it's also a huge hypochondriac in that it tells you to pull over and go to a dealership even when a tire has slightly low pressure due to cold weather.  That is very annoying and alarming when you are trying to just drive casually somewhere.      When it comes to the iDrive.  The only good thing about the map is how you can instantly zoom in and out with the use of the track wheel thingy, but the routes are really dimwitted.  The new letter tracking input is just not easier than the normal track wheel letter selection.  It's just too hard to get right at 70 mph.  The iPhone/iPod integration is also bad because it is meant to be universal so it works like a really dimwitted file directory sort of system so you can't do advanced features specific to your device.  I'm also really disappointed the stereo has no midrange control, it has a great set of speakers, but it's hard to get the midrange out for sure.The primary reason I chose the X5 over its direct competitors, the Lexus RX, Acura MDX, Audi Q5/Q7, Mercedes M Class, Porsche Cayenne, etc. is that l preferred the look of the exterior and interior over all the others.  Having had a BMW in Europe I knew what to expect with the driving experience.  What I wasn't prepared for coming from a VW to a this car, in America at least, is just how hated you can be in the real world.  People seem much less likely to let you pass on a highway, let you merge, and let you out of side turns.  I thought it was imagination, but even my wife noticed that she is definitely treated differently in this car that our other cars."
car_1050,Smooth Quiet Ride,"Beautiful car, great ride, although you do feel bumps to a degree.  Not as plush a ride as Lexus or Lincoln.  Car not made for short people who are 5'1"", but I can work around it.  Car is my husband's car, and fits him well. Hard for me to see over high dash on driver's side, hard to get out of car without bruising back of calves (but salesman showed me the trick on how short people can get out more easily), back of front seat cushion makes seat uncomfortable for short people, as the cushion pushes my back out.  It hits the right place of the back on regular-height and tall people.  If I sit on a pillow, the back of the front-seat cushion fits my back fine, but I shouldn't have to do this in an expensive car like this. Car handles beautifully, quiet inside, high-quality materials.  Hard for me to see blind spot when I turn around due to my height.  Biggest complaint is difficulty of using the features, changing a radio station, finding what you want on the screen.  There are some buttons, but most features accessed by a mouse-type wheel on the console.  Very dangerous to find what you want while you're driving.   Mercedes is much more intuitive and easier to use.  No current weather outside is displayed for the passenger - it only shows for the driver!  This should be standard in all cars.  Also, was told by salesman that the rear-view mirror would display the direction you're headed with an ""N,"" ""NE,"" etc., but it doesn't.  Also, you cannot use Maximum A/C or Heat on the floor only.  Being short, this is important to me, as the middle vents always blow in my face and eyes.  However, happily and  surprisingly, the BMW vents can be directed so it doesn't blow in my face, unlike the Mercedes.  Storage space is adequate; nice, extra storage compartment under floor in very back if you do not use it for a spare tire, which you shouldn't need with the run-flat tires.  Glove compartment is small for size of car - the manual takes up the whole glove compartment.  My husband absolutely loves the car.  It is fun to drive, even for short people!  And I love how quiet it is inside."
car_1051,Buyer Beware of problematic Air Conditioner,"I had to bring my car to the dealership twice for repair on the AC on 2015 BMW X5 with less than 10k miles.  Essentially, this is the first summer using the AC on long highway distance at speed.  Dealership had to contact BMW in order to come up with a modification to the (transistor???) as a solution, yet to be tested.  My understanding is this does happen on other BMW models as well.  Buyer be aware of this as we learned the hard way on a brand new $60K SUV with problematic AC."
car_1052,"Flawless, FUN vehicle.","Have owned the vehicle for six month, with about 6000 miles driven. It is flawless. Mileage in town is 23 to 25. Hiway mileage is 28 to 30. Got the multifuntion seats and they are the most comfortable seat in any car I have ever driven. I-drive is a bit too complicated but not that difficult to use after a while. My question is why? We took delivery at the Performance Center in Spartanburg SC. That is quite an experience. It was so enjoyable we went back for a second time. It is an extreme confidence builder to drive your and all the other BMW models at max performance. You will not drive like that on the ""streets"" but should you have to you know the vehicle is totally capable. BUY ONE!"
car_1053,My 3rd X5 SAV,"(Previously leased a 2003 X5 and 2008 X5 4.8i).By far, this is my favorite X5, except for the inferior premium sound system compared to my 2008 X5.Improved NAV system, but takes getting used to.Cargo space is decent.Fuel economy at 13.5 MPG average is unacceptable.Although the 8-speed automatic transmission is smooth, lower engine acceleration for city driving is annoying sluggish.Great back-up camera that shows actual image of vehicle from above and in the rear."
car_1054,"Great car, Poor service. Cannot get them to do an oil change","This is an update on my previous review titled so far so good. Actually not so good anymore. I currently have 15500 and BMW still refuses to do an oil change. I called for my first oil change at 10000 miles and made an appointment for an oil change and some minor work. After a couple of hours, I get the news that my car does NOT need an oil change, I have to come back at 15000 miles. Crap, why waste my time for this? So recently I made another appointment for an oil change at 15000 and again after another couple of hours of waiting they tell me that again they will not do an oil change because in oil is in good shape and I need to come back in another 5000 miles. This is not worth my time."
car_1055,Buy one if you can afford it. (update),"I now have 3000 miles on my X5 and after 2 months of driving it gets better every time I climb in the perforated, multi contoured, air conditioned, heated, and massage chair seats. My only real complaint is the sound of the stereo. I upgraded for the premium sound but after having the Logic 7 stereo in my 650, this one sounds low grade. Most of the sound comes from the speaker on the dash board even though I've changed the sound settings over and over to try to get a more balance sound out of it. All other options and aspects of this vehicle have been outstanding so far. Even my 19 year old son likes driving it."
car_1056,Fantastic Car So Far,"I purchased this vehicle in November 2010 after a six month new car search.I previously owned a 2003 Nissan XTerra and was searching for a vehicle that provided the space I was used to, as well as a feeling of comfort and fun.I'm still surprised by how much I have enjoyed this BMW.The SUV is fun to drive and has all the bells and whistles you could ask for.I'm constantly finding new things that make life easier.From sending Google Maps directions directly to my Navigation to the impressive music hard drive, it's just an easy vehicle to love."
car_1057,Buy one if you can afford it.,"First off let me say that I'm comparing this vehicle againist my BMW 650i that I traded in for it. Plus my wifes BMW 535. It really is a great vehicle. Don't expect it to be or act like a sports car because it's not. Don't expect it to be an off road vehicle because it's not. It trully is a sports activity vehicle. It is fun to drive. It does have many comfort features. It does alot of things very well but it is in its own catagory.It has great performance but not as good as my 650 so I'm being picky. It is fun to drive but not as fun as my 650 or 535. I don't have any complaints about the X5 as a whole, just a few things stick out because I've been driving a BMW for almost 10 years now."
car_1058,BMW are terrible especially if buying from Peoria,"Very expensive to maintain, especially if you buy it from Peoria, il. Cheaters. They'll stab you as they did it on me. Bmw looks good but, it's not worth it, trust me, that was my second x5. I will never buy it again. It was 2011 and now we are in Feb. 2011 and I sold it finally. Hate bmw and hate bmw Peoria , illinois."
car_1059,"Good Car, but not perfect!","I purchased the X5 diesel in Dec 2010 and I have only put on 2500 miles so far. I took one month vacation overseas in Jan/Feb. When I came back, I was worried that the battery might be dead. To my surprise, it started like I just parked it overnight. I have gotten 25.8 mpg on 70/30 Hwy/City driving. It handles most road conditions well. We had some snow just yesterday and today in Seattle, I can feel that the car swins a little bit on the road (less than one inch accumulation), not as confident as other 4wd suvs. Luckily we don't have too many snow days here. The navigation is not very accurate. When I was driving on highway, it showed that I was on a road pararel to the hwy. When I get home ( rural setting), it showed that I am on my neighbour's road 200 ft off my home. Looks like the Germans are not as good as the Japanese in terms of electronics. Also, my second key lost its battery already and can not open or lock the car. It is on my to do list to bring it to the dealer."
car_1060,NOT PERFECT BUT GOOD,"Build quality and driving experience are top notch. Here are my issues; (i) because it handles so well, it is not that great in the snow; (ii) it is vault tight but there quite a few rattles in the back which started after 5000 miles; (iii) there could have been a bigger cargo area-my corvette has almost as much room; (iv) very sensitive check engine light warning system and not all deales know how to fix it-one dealer said my car need a full day of re-programming... a second simply reset itminutes after I arrived for service. Do not open gas cap while engine is running."
car_1061,Buyer Beware,"Bought a X5 5.0 and it has been a disaster. Car has gone down (literally wouldn't start or drive) 3 times in under the first 7,000 miles. First time it was the battery/alternator. Second time it was an engine coil and now they claim my spark plugs went bad. This is not to mention a defective DVD player that had to be replaced. Also, one thing your salesperson won't tell you but every service guy knows right away is that Verizon Blackberrys do not work with the Idrive system. The Idrive will go down about every two months. You then have to unpair your phone, take the battery out and reset up the phone. They should tell people this before they buy the cars but they don't."
car_1062,New improved bmw x5,Vehicle has plenty of power and handles very well. My only two complaints are steering is a little stiff in parking lots and I having a resonating noise out of the exhaust between gears 1-3. My two previous BMWs did not have those issues.
car_1063,Update on my Original Review,"I still think the X5 and all BMW's are a blast to drive, but I'm starting to have the High Pressure Fuel Pump issues.  It takes longer to start up (anywhere from 4-5 seconds) and I'm starting to see re-occurring error codes whenever I hook up my diagnostic system.  BMW went public on there HPFP issue, but only for 2007- 2010 model years.  They need to include 2011 models in their recall, as my X5 and several other 2011 model year cars are having HPFP issues"
car_1064,This car is not very good to my liking,"The car was stiff, I had to fill it up 4 times a week just doing my job showing homes on the mainline, I thought it was overpriced for what you got and I myself spent over 60k on mine and I still do not see my investment coming back, I had gotten the gps system in my vehicle and I thought it was very difficult to use and my widget would get stuck very often and that was annoying, then it was the trunk it was super heavy to open and sometimes it would get stuck and there is 2 parts to it to get it open fully, the back seats were very uncomfortable to ride in because they were hard as a rock and very stiff. The 4x4 is one of the most awful terrain vehicles I have ever driven."
car_1065,Fun and Fabulous,This is THE most incredible vehicle I've ever had the pleasure of owning & driving.  This is an extremely intuitive vehicle with extraordinary built in safety features.
car_1066,Great Machine,I bought the X5 35i with the M Sports package.  I love this machine.  It's almost as fun to drive as my corvette. It handles more like a sedan than a nearly two ton SUV.  It's my new favorite toy.
car_1067,"Fun to drive, few odd quirks, delicate","I purchased a 2011 X5d at Long Beach BMW.  So far, I'm not impressed with Long Beach BMW and may never return, but that is another story for another time.  One month in, I still like the vehicle.  It has a few odd quirks and some parts are of questionable durability, but over all, not bad and fun to drive.  Odd quirks: rear tailgate button on keyless remote is too sensitive. Shoulder belt height is not adjustable.  Questionable durability: plastic on under side of running boards and around wheel wells is not going to hold up. Already a few minor pits and scratches in the first 1000 miles on average city streets.  Also, one rim already scratched and I don't parallel park."

car_1069,Fast Fast Very Fast,"So Far So Good. and it's Quick very very Quick Broom broom. the only thing don't like  is hard to maneuver at the parking lot. i dont know why? but when it's cruising and passing oh yeah you fly ""Superb baby""mileage  average for me about 18mpg."
car_1070,Nice change,"I recently purchased a new 2011 X5 Sport model and have to say I love it. I was previously driving a Range Rover Sport HSE and have to say it's a nice change. Comfort, quality and great handling put my old RRS to shame. With the new turbo engine this thing is fast and has the handling of a coupe."
car_1071,2011 BMW X5 Outperforms,"This is my 3rd BMW and by far the best.  The performance is awesome and the panoramic glass roof is unparalleled.  I am averaging 18 and 22 miles per gallon.  Sound system is great and the you hear no noise from outside.  Suspension is great and the power of the twin turbo is incredible.  Handling is awesome too.  takes curves with ease and does not drive like a typical SUV, more like a sedan."
car_1072,X5 50i 9K mile whine update,"My X5 50i is now 4 months old, has 9,000 miles and still whines at around 2,000 rpm, badly enough to embarrass a Lada driver.  Apparently BMW is OK with that.  However, if you complain enough you will discover that this problem is common to the X5 50i and the 750i which both have the same power train.  Apparently BMW  has now determined that the cause is a defective engine oil pump. The repair requires removing the front differential and axles, the front subframe, lifting the engine and removing 2 oil pans in order to replace the pump. This is documented on the Bimmerfest website, so I was not alone with this problem.  Now, do I trust my Dealership to do this without screwing up my car?"
car_1073,Better than expected,"We have always been Volvo owners.  My wife wanted a SUV we tested Volvo, Mercedes and BMW.  The BMW handled much better than the Mercedes.  I thought the ride would be harsh but it is not.  We took delivery at the BMW Performance Center in South Carolina.  Excellent program and an excellent vehicle.  I have never owned BMW but now I am considering purchasing another one for myself next year. We are averaging 22 mpg.  Handles like my old Volvo S80 V8."
car_1074,Bimmer are the best,Bought this after much research comparing it to Q7 and MB diesel. No match as the interior is far superior in both built and  ergonomics. The iDrive is much improved and very easy to use. Mild diesel knock but less than MB and Q7. Great Torque and Turbo. Drives as expected with smooth yet engaging ride. Exterior and Ventilated seats are awesome.
car_1075,Whinny noise,"As with a prior review, my 2011 X5 5.0 also makes a whinny noise akin to a golf cart when engine is hot and when upshifting from 1st to 3rd gears.  Getting worse as mileage adds up.  2x to the dealership and nothing can be done as it is the alternator?  Give me my 2007 4.8 back please.   Heard the 2011 7 series is also having this problem.   Not acceptable for 75k cars"
car_1076,Great vehicle!,"Less than 1k miles so far.  iDrive and Nav much improved compared to my 2009 5-series, which really wasn't that bad.  The 8-speed automatic is super smooth and interior noise while driving is quite muted..  The new engine really has a lot of power.  The new oyster leather interior color is very classy.  I noticed the wind deflector on the sunroof was misaligned during the delivery process, but have had to wait for a replacement to come into stock.  Two weeks after delivery, noticed one front fog light was out, but has since been working, so will need dealer to look it over next time in for service."
car_1077,X5 50is,Great car.  Spacious interior and roomy.  Drives great.  Excellent handling and very quite despite sports package and large 315 20” tires.  Lots of power and torque; one of the fastest SUVs you can get.  Good gas millage for 5300+ lb vehicle (depending on driving style).  On long trip we averaged 20-21 MPG fully loaded with 5 adults.
car_1078,Vroom diesel (update),"Ok. So this is an update so see the other first if you have not.  The door panel is squeaking after 1500 miles. I have an appointment with BMW on Wednesday. I still dislike the iDrive. I can put in Nav Directions at 100 MPH if I wanted to but, the seat belt nanny beeps constantly if I take my belt off to get better range of motion to see to park at 2 MPH or less. Not only that the screen that is supposed to help me is now blocked by the fasten seat belt warning giving me no sight at the front of the X5. I haven't figured out how to turn of the screen if I want to still and I don't consider myself technology challenged. Also I hate the automatic wipers. see below."
car_1079,It's a keeper!,"I've had a X5 4.4 for little over ten years (one of the very first). It still looks and drives like brand new at 7ok, so I didn't want to sell it to a stranger who wouldn't appreciate its condition and gave it to my daughter. I replaced it with a 5.0 which I feel I'll be happy with for another ten years or so. Performance is great, ride is firm with the M sport package and 20"" wheels, but that's how I like it. Build quality is excellent.Transmission is smooth and fun in manual mode, though with eight gears you can't take your hand off the shift knob, you're constantly busy. It is very forgiving though if you get lazy, as it has lots of torque almost regardless of the gear you are in."
car_1080,So far so good,"I just got this about a couple of weeks ago and already went to a trip out of town and put in over 1500 miles. So far, so good. I am very concerned about reliability with my previous experiences with BMWs but hopefully this one will be much better. The fit and finish seems good and i do love the panoramic roof. It is a nice car to take on a road-trip, I really enjoy it, we will see about reliability."
car_1081,"Strong, Stylish and Sophisticated",Proud of myself for buying this versatile and seriously designed machine.
car_1082,Beats all of em',"Test drove just about every SUV out there. The 2011 Ford Edge, the 2011 Jeep Cherokee, FX35, XC60, ML350, Audi Q5. The X5 is king of the hill. Nothing drives and handles like this SUV. I came out of a 535Xi which was about the best handling car I've ever driven. This SUV comes close. Still brand new so my fingers are crossed on the reliability but there's nothing like the ultimate driving machine. The interior is gorgeous and the exterior is classic BMW."
car_1083,Excellent,I went from a Toyota Highlander to the new X5. The ride quality is excellent as well as build & sight lines. BMW has done a great job in listening to consumers recommendations and incorporating them into an terrific vehicle.
car_1084,Helluva Machine,"This is a "" real machine "" to be proud of. It's fun to drive , well- built, and performs very well. Classy, stylish, and muscular."
car_1085,Super SUV,"I choose another BMW after purchasing a 2009 M3 convertible. This SUV combines refinement, luxury and agility. It's fun too drive and gets good fuel economy. I upgraded from a 2008 Toyota Highlander which is a great SUV in itself. I choose this SUV over the M series Mercedes which in my opinion didn't compare. If you have the means and are looking for a great SUV check out the X5."
car_1086,Vroom Diesel,"We traded an 2009 ML 320 Bluetec on this one. I miss the better visors in the Mercedes and the easier Command system versus the Idrive. And this is the most updated version of iDrive? I miss the keypad to make calls and change stations on the MB. But now for the good part BMW is head and shoulders above the MB in terms of performance, and It is rated better in the MPG dept. I love the panoramic roof. I like knowing that i wont have to wonder what my service is gonna cost me for 4 more years its ZERO out of pocket.  If you are looking at either one, trust me its the BMW that you want. Not that the MB is all bad mind you its just not as surefooted like the BMW when you push it."
car_1087,X5 50i Very Disappointing,"I now have about 3000 miles on my 2011 X5 50i.  I had high expectations for a vehicle that I paid almost $80K for.  However, there is a persistent and annoying engine whine at slower speeds in the lower gears.  It increases and decreases with engine speed and can be reproduced at about 2000 rpm while stationary and in neutral.  I think that it could be the clutch in the alternator.  However, two Dealerships have told me that it's normal for the 4.4 twin turbo, get used to it, or turn up the radio.  I liked the car but this is unacceptable. I need to get rid of this car. I can't believe that any car manufacturer would approve this situation."
car_1088,So far so great!,"The car is beautiful to look at and a delight to drive. The fit and finish are excellent. There are a lot of features and a lot to learn. If all continues to work year after year as now, then this is as close to an ideal as I have come. Time will tell."
car_1089,"Fast, economic, luxurious, but...","Great vehicle overall, with really nice handling (xDrive), good braking, comfortable. The third row seats are for small children or for short distance, pretty much anybody."
car_1090,Everything I wanted and More,"The X5 is a great Sport Activity Vehicle.  It is a bit on the expensive side compared to Ford, Chevy and other big named SUV manufacturers, but they aren't as thrilling to drive as the X5.  Performance is spot on, like many other BMW's, and the new Twin-Scroll Turbo provides even more thrills.  Coming from a 335xi (Twin Turbo) the X5 provides the same excitement during driving that the 335 did. Also the interior space is massive, and provides enough comfort for me and my occasional passengers.  I do not regret this purchase."
car_1091,For show NOT off road,"PRO: Great Saving by order through manufacture and took 4 weeks to get the wagon Xdrive 35i. MSRP $61,925, bought for $56,250. Luxury richness is there.  CON: Nav & temp systems are rather difficult to navigate. Rear camera noise would not turn when need it to be off."
car_1092,X5 Diesel is a great car!,"I also own an ML320 diesel (My wife drives the ML and I drive the X5) and although the ride of the X5 is not as smooth, the X5 is better handling, faster, and better fuel mileage (Averaging 24mpg in the first 1800 miles). I have only had the car for about 1 month, but it is a great car. I read reviews that the ride was rough, and the seats we not comfortable, but I do not find those true. The X5 rides great, and the seats are very comfortable. I do have the multi contour seats and you can adjust them in so many ways. My wife wants to trade cars now."
car_1093,Excellent SUV,I just bought a 2011 BMW X5 35i Premium. Love the acceleration and the fuel economy. Being 8 speed also makes it very smooth. I-drive is great and so is the panoramic roof.
car_1094,Wow  What a vehicle,"Took delivery of my 5.0 with the M package and let me tell you it's a beast.  Disregard the 5.3 0 - 60 time, in manual mode it's faster.  What a dream to drive, as comfortable as a 750.  And the best part is the lease payments are low because the residual is 62% (36 months)  Get one, you won't be disappointed"
car_1095,Very nice,"Very good performance, handling and acceleration, diesel provides a lot of torque and you don't feel as much lag as you do on a 5 series. Needed something sporty that I could take the family too, this car makes the trick. Finish is top level."
car_1096,Like it so far,"Test drove both the premium and diesel versions. Diesel felt heavy and did not have the quickness the premium X5 had. Overall, ride is firm, handles well, and gas mileage early on is not bad, about 17 mpg in city driving. Like the punch the turbo delivers when you press the accelerator. Had some issues with the power windows but since have corrected. I-drive is fairly easy to use and like the fact that you can store music. Power liftgate is a nice option. Plenty of other good suvs out there but this one is one of the best inside and out."
car_1097,X5 50i,"The twin-turbo 400 hp V8 in the 50i performs very well, providing plenty of power and torque, yet I am getting 18.5 mpg with a 50:50 mix of highway and city. The X5 feels almost as quick as my 2008 550i I turned in (end of lease) for the X5. Very quiet ride, 19"" run flats make very little road noise and the upgraded stereo is incredible. Handling is excellent, and steering and brakes are very responsive."
car_1098,BMW with Diesel,"It's very powerful when starting to move, and also is very smooth.  Fuel economy is about 22~24 mpg on average so far.  Excellent on-road performance and handling, with comfortable seating for the driver and rear passengers.  This SUV is what we expected."
car_1099,2011 X5 35i,"Traded in my 2005 Porsche Cayenne s for new x5 35i. Test drove x5 35d but felt the gas version was more refined and still got decent mileage, though the diesel had great torque. It is very smooth and ride quality is great. Firm ride and it's very luxurious. Cayenne had much better handling, cornering and shorter turning circle. New 8 speed automatic transmission is very smooth but doesn't really downshift like my Infiniti and Porsche."
car_1100,2011 improved more than just engines,"I traded directly from a 2009 X5 35d (built in July 2009) to a 2011 35d (built in May 2010) and noted significant differences even though the diesel engine and transmission are unchanged. The vehicle is quieter. Road/engine/exhaust noise are less intrusive into the cabin and the suspension is more supple. Highway ride is more composed. The media joke that most of the 2011's 4,000 new parts must be in the engines, but clearly more than the drive train and bumper styling have changed. This X5 feels like a luxury SUV now. The gravelly sound of the diesel engine is just a distant murmur except on hard acceleration, which is to be expected from BMW."
car_1101,X5 35d,This is an early review as have not even made it through the break-in period.   The car handles like a dream.  I did not get the sports package. The car is capable of taking corners faster than I feel comfortable taking them.   The Diesel knock is noticeable during initial acceleration but once up to speed you really have to listen for it. The noisiest part of cruising is the tire wine.   I-drive is a breeze to use.
car_1102,2011 refinements perfect the X5,"Just took delivery of my 7th X5 after trading a 2009 35d for a 2011 35d. I loved the 2009 diesel, but road, exhaust, and engine noise were a little too intrusive. BMW refined the 2011 to reduce the ""bad"" noises while keeping ""good"" noise like the sporty grumble during acceleration. The suspension also seems to have been improved. It's subtle and the X5 is certainly not Lexus quiet, but I immediately noticed the difference: a more refined luxury feel. Press releases talk about new styling and engines, but not the improved suspension and noise reduction. That's a shame because those improvements address the only significant flaw in my previous X5. Good job BMW, you were listening."
car_1103,The only luxury SUV,"It is very smooth.  It handles very well.  The new, twin turbo, fuel injected engine & new eight speed automatic transmission is unreal.  Fuel economy is much improved.  The new 300 horsepower engine is as smooth as glass in delivering great performance.  The handling is just excellent.  The comfort access system is a winner.  I will never have another SUV without this capability. The run-flat tires are the best!  This is the ultimate driving machine in an SUV!"
car_1104,Beemer UP,"This is the most comfortable, stylish vehicle.  Great get up and go.  Hugs the road like a glove.  Has a sun roof, but not useful to us.  Just our choice. Love the way it jumps from a dead stop.  Hopefully, we will be buying another in the future.  Love this car."
car_1105,Nice looking but......wouldn't buy another one,"We bought this used CPO. Nice to have factory paid service 4 yr 50k miles, but BMW won't give you a free maintenance oil change till 15k miles This oil change interval is not good for a hard working 6 cylinder Turbo engine. I ended up paying for the oil changes every 7500 miles, as I felt necessary for a $70k vehicle. Brake service under BMW dime doesn't replace rotors, just pads. Yet try to have a brake service performed by BMW, just changing pads is NOT allowed?? They won't!  OK lets go to reliability, absolutely horrific. I have owned over 50 cars in my lifetime, this being the worst.  The car was in the shop last year over 4 months, from transmission issues to other things. The front suspension is designed to fail at 60k miles, so plan on putting money in to it. Thankfully we purchased an extended warranty for 48 months and additional 4 yrs. The NAV must be updated yearly, RUN FLAT TIRES don't last more than 20K miles, at a cost of $1400, every 18 months. The ride is stiff, even when switching from RUN FLATS to conventional tires. I get so many compliments on this SAV but OMG, what a maintenance nightmare. BMW hourly repair rate is $243 per hour. Won't buy another one...."
car_1106,Transfer Case problem of the 2011 BMW X5,"My BMW X5 2011 mileage only 25000. I went to the dealer for driveshaft recall fix. Dealer told me that in my BMW transfer case leak oil and needs replacement seal soon. Cost is $600+, and I accepted. They also told me when they removed the seals to replace the seals they saw that the leak was coming from the transfer box control unit not just the seals. The root cause of the excessive leak is the control unit.  this repair would be $2134 and up. I am wounding is that  car is the biggest piece of garbage available at this time?"
car_1107,Buyer Beware,"This car is the biggest piece of garbage available at this time. If you like driving loaner cars and having your vehicle in the shop for extended periods of time then this is the vehicle for you. BMW should be ashamed of themselves!! Even the employees agree that this vehicle is a POS!! I have owned it for 14 months and in that time it has been in the shop for 4 months, over $15,000 later and I now feel safe to get rid of it, prior to this I could not in good faith have turned this vehicle over to anybody as it was not roadworthy and it took 3+months to get it to where it wouldn't lose power when accelerating. I was almost killed in this POS. BMW you need to get your act together and recall all of the X5's, fix them so they are safe at your cost. I have spoken to 10+ owners of this POS and they have all had the exact same problems. Looking into class action suit against BMW. For the safety or you and your family do not even consider buying this vehicle. With all this said buyer beware of Grubbs Infiniti Grapevine, they will promise you anything and never follow through, NEVER PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM AND THIS DEALERSHIP THEY ARE DISHONEST, WILL SELL YOU AN UNSAFE, UNROADWORTHY CARE WITHOUT A THOUGHT, ABUSE WOMEN THINKING THEY HAVE NO BRAIN AND NO INSIGHT TO THE BUYING A VEHICLE OR THE MAINTENANCE OF."
car_1108,"Loved it new, love it now!","Outstanding car - love the ride, ergonomics and performance. Diesel gives me outstanding gas mileage and the torque is always there. It has stiffer steering, which seems to be a knock to some, but I think this gives me a precision feel - I drive other cars and they feel mushy and imprecise in comparison. 75,000 miles without a problem. Cargo-wise, this thing holds a ton. Especially if you fold down half the seat. I am always rotating between fishing rods, tailgate gear or other stuff - it's basically a pickup truck in a luxury, performance SUV body."
car_1109,"bought it with 44,000 miles","i came off owning a chevy volt and the shock of only 19 mpg in town has been stunning.  from nearly 100mpg to this.  but, i truly love the sound of the diesel engine, i love sitting up so high, and the torque this engine churns out is sheer delight.  having owned several high end diesels, this engine has to be the nicest i have driven.  i had a mercedes benz (84) turbo diesel wagon for 10 yrs as one of my drivers (while having other cars to drive) and i rue the day i sold that car to a good friend.  owning this is sort of the same experience.  the interior ergonomics are good, the a/c system is strange with the 3 ranges of fan speeds avail on automatic, the rear a/c system seems like overkill but i live in florida and summer might just make me change my tune on that one.  the sheer interior size after the volt is dramatic.  it's large as heck inside.  the sunroof is great, but i never use it living where i do.  the handling is good but this is not the kind of car one throws around, though possible, not practical.  when i bought it i made the mistake of adjusting the computer and the systems it runs, and found i had turned off things i had no idea the car had.  for example, the lane-change-signal system can be turned off, and i did it, only to think that i was beginning to experience electrical issues and i had just gotten the car one week before.  to this day, i still don't know how to turn on the intermittent wipers, and for the life of me cannot find the instructions on this issue in the manual.  good visibility, very hard seats but driven in all day they don't really cause much fatigue.  i've owned worse.  the electric tailgate closure is overkill and just one thing to malfunction.  although generally i am impressed with the car in the 4,000 miles i have driven it, i think i will go back to electric when i tire of this vehicle, it's far more responsible as a citizen of the planet.  but for a 2.5 ton vehicle, it's impressive overall."
car_1110,Great ride,"Excellent car, expensive repair"
car_1111,Worst car ever,"Just tonight, first time in year, no engine light.  My 19 year and I were celebrating, look, no engine light.  Of course we had to speak up over a squealing fan that conveniently stops squealing at the dealership.  Oh, one year of ownership, 13,000 dollars of maintenance, never again BMW.  I could go down the list but why bother, just don't do it."
car_1112,2011 BMW X5 50i,"Has been a great SAV so far. Apart from regular maintenance, no issues (knock on wood)."
car_1113,Greate,Greate
car_1114,"By all means, stay away from the x5 50i.","Bought this vehicle with only 9K mile on it, and by far has been the worst reliable vehicle I have ever owned. Mind you, this is my wife SUV. Not even a month of owning it and maybe around a thousand mile, my low oil light indicator turns on but there is still another 10k miles until next oil change, so decided to do an additional oil change at my expense since BMW refused to do one for me. At about 2-3k miles again, going to Austin for the weekend from Houston, and my low oil light come back on again. Took it back to the dealer and they added over 2 quarts of oil. I asked them why the oil consumption, and their response was it's normal. A month or two, rolls out and the Aux. Pump goes out. No problem since it's still under warranty and your driving on a brand new loner car for 3 weeks, since they were on backorder from Germany. A couple of month go by without any issues and then the high battery consumption light come. They replaced the battery and a couple of module and returned the vehicle back in a couple of day, no problem. A couple of months go by again, and bam, the battery light come back again, took it back to the dealer, they kept the vehicle for over a month this time, saying they couldn't find the issue and when they finally did, it turned out to be a right front door handle, that would not dormant. Happy to get the vehicle back, when I get a letter from BMW about a big campaign(another word for a RECALL) and to bring the vehicle in to the dealer. Brought the vehicle to the dealer, and they tell me that it will stay in the shop for a couple of weeks since it's a big campaign for Injector, Vacuum system, Etc. So again, they kept vehicle at the dealer for a month. I'm beginning to get aggravated  with vehicle already and am thinking of replacing it already. But instead, decided to keep it, after all, it's a very nice SUV, M-packaged with all the bells and whittles. Just about 2 weeks ago we decided to take a road trip for spring break, and drive to California. Long story short, we broke down in between Bakersfield and San Jose, ruined our Vacation and cost me over $2000 in unexpected repairs bill. The Starter went out, the coils went out and this is ONLY with just a little over 30K MILES!!!!! Folks, I LOVE BMW, having and owing 135i, (2) 335i, x5 3.0, and now the X5 50i, By all means , Stay away from the X5 50i."
car_1115,"Great looking car, but costs.","Gas mileage is terrible.  Great power and handling, but for the money spent, they should have better multimedia."
car_1116,The Cost To Maintain,"I have had multiple repairs to this car. Luckily all were covered under warranty. Don't buy a desiel unless it is certified with a warranty. DEF tank has been replaced 3 times. I have been stuck 4 times with ""reduced engine power"" because of different sensors. On the he bright side this is a very comfortable car and great to drive. 25+ miles to the gallon."
car_1117,oil field,"Bought this car with 39.000 just 2 weeks ago.  First issue, minor oil ring seal. Leaked for a bit. Now the issue is its burning oil.  Do all bmw cars and trucks have oil issues? Went through this with the 645ci.  Ridiculous!"
car_1118,Awesome machine,"This thing is a blast to drive, and a really good option for families with one or two kids.  You can't beat the safety features; this thing's a tank.  The only real concern with the X5 35d is the upkeep cost.  If you consider the fuel economy, maybe it evens out...but doubtful.  I can't say the repair cost is high, because we haven't had to actually have any repairs done (60k miles).  The warranty covered a few sensors that needed to be replaced, but everything else has been routine.  Don't bother with a dealership for oil changes.  They will straight up lie to you.  I had two local BMW shops tell me it's over $300 to change the oil and fill the DEF on my 35d. Order the Castrol oil, a filter and some DEF and do it in the driveway, or take it to a small shop and pay 15 bucks.   Total cost for me was less than $100.  If we can afford it in the future, we will certainly invest in another X-model.  Let's hope we can squeeze 150k out of this one."
car_1119,Pricey but Nicey,"I suspect that a low mileage used X5 would be the way to go for most folks. We bit the bullit in 2010 and ordered ours with all of the options. At the time, there was a hefty rebate on the diesel and a tax incentive of $5k . My wife and I both drive it and it has 66,000 miles. Brakes, tires and a battery is all we have done to it. Regular dealer and good independent service have kept the cost down. You don't buy one of these to save money. You buy it for the driving experience, comfort and safety that the Beemer is famous for. We get about 30 mpg on the highway and 24 in town. I had the dealer install the BMW trailer hitch package and it is worth it. I'll pull a horse or big utility trailer with it easily. The hitch is rated at 6500 lbs, but the same car in europe is rated at 7700 lbs. The hitch kit from the dealer includes an integrated trailer brake system hooked into the computer. They re-program the computer to ""know"" the trailer and lights etc. The shift patterns change when a trailer is hooked up. Pretty good stuff. BMW says the transmission and some other fluids are for life. My mechanic says to change them out at about 80K. I tend to believe him as it makes sense that any fluid will break down over time. Would I buy one again? Absolutely. New? Probably not. Probably get another diesel with under 10K miles on it. They are around and priced well.UPDATE 7/15/2017The repair costs make the car a poor value if you plan on keeping it. We are having lots of problems with the diesel emissions system that are running into several thousand dollars. BMW has sort of addressed the issue but not entirely, The have issued an ""Extended warranty"" on some components but the car is constantly in the shop. I suspect the gas version may be better. Stay away from the diesel or buy the extended warranty and sell it before the warranty expires."
car_1120,My 3rd X5,"(Previously leased 2003 4.4 and 2008 4.8 X5 models).By far, this 50i model is my favorite X5.Improved satellite navigation system lets you speak the entire destination at once, instead of bit-by-bit, and is usually accurate.Sound system has both an equalizer and surround sound.Excellent back-up camera that shows not only the rear view, but also view from above, which is great for back-in and parallel parking.8-speed automatic is noticeably smoother than the earlier X5's 6-speeds transmissions.Fuel economy is slightly better than the earlier X5's (averaging 13.5 to 15.0 MPG).The 19"" tires help.The '03 and '08 X5's both had 20"" tires (and were more expensive to replace)."
car_1121,It just keeps getting better,"I had the 2011 x5 diesel built to my specs and delivered in Sept 2010.I loaded it up with almost all accessories which, like all German cars, add considerably to the price of the car.I now have about 26,000 miles on it.The car drives as close to a BMW feel as is possible for an SUV and continues to improve as the computer learns how you drive it.I am tall (6'3"") and it is one of the few cars that truly fits me.We drive the car regularly between Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, and it is hard to imagine a better car for this use."
car_1122,German engineering at its finest,"I have about 21,000 miles on the odometer and am mostly very pleased with the vehicle.Fuel mileage is frankly amazing for a 5200 lb SUV.Worst tank was 22mpg and best was nearly 28, overall average of 25mpg.It's fast enough for nearly any situation. It's a fantastic long-distance vehicle with a range of nearly 600 miles between fill ups, and grown-up back seat passengers have commented the rear is plenty comfortable.It also handles better than any other SUV I've driven.Complaints include some cheap plastic in certain places in the interior, an ""upgraded"" audio system that's just so so, some turbo lag off idle, turning radius is terrible, and you have to get used to the diesel noise."
car_1123,It's a diesel? Yup,"Got a 2011 left over that the dealer had for a while probably because of the color (sparkling bronze) but I kind of like it. I have almost 4000 miles on it now and have done 2 longish trips with it. I avg around 25 for urban driving and on the 2 longish trips have seen 31. Even with the ski box on i still see around 27 on the highway. I would have liked it it have the sport seats, but the standard seats seem to be fine although it has taken some time to get the right seating position for comfort and visibility. I very much enjoy the rear seat room for friends and the ability to have room for the dogs in the back. I did get a trailer hitch for it for the bikes. Kinda pricey though."
car_1124,Bye Bye X5,"Bought my X5, custom built, in 2010, delivered Aug 2010.I put just about every option into it except that suspension option.I don't plan to offroad in my BMW so I didn't see the point.Sales experience was horrible.Performance is sub-par.It suffers from horrible performance below 50 mph.Hesitation off the line and if you give it gas to accelerate it waits for about a second before kicking you in the shorts.I assume this is because it is in 6th gear at 40mph.After a 1.5 years of driving it I have had enough.It has nice polish but the engine/tranny is junk.Just traded it for a Volvo which isn't as polished but actually goes when I give it gas."
car_1125,"Beautiful vehicle, but still has flaws","The X5 is beautiful, but not flawless. The navigation sucks and doesn't even give correct directions. There was no dvd included to update it. I've read elsewhere the dealer charges alot for a new one. The ride is firm. The seat bottoms on the active ventilated seats are hard, flat, and unsupportive. They quickly become uncomfortable. I had to buy a seat cushion to make them bearable.The driver's seat puts out alot of heat from underneath and behind.The transmission on the diesel isn't always smooth starting out. Now that I have close to 6,000 miles on the vehicle, it sounds like the diesel is getting louder. The worst thing of all, was the way we were treated at the first BMW dealership."
car_1126,Great Car -- Highly Recommended after 1 Year Use,"Traded in a 2008 535 - needed something bigger for 2 kids.After driving all the midsize SUVs, I narrowed it down to the Audi Q7 diesel and the BMW X5d.Preference for diesel due to mileage.Ended up with a better deal on the X5d.I couldn't be happier with the car.Of the midsize SUVs I drove, the X5 comes closest to giving car handling.The road feel is spot on.Interior design is great and now after having the car since Nov.2011, all components are still working well.Diesel has great responsiveness, of course not as peppy as 535 I traded, but very respectable. Mileage avg 21.7Enjoying the Sport Package.Got stock radio and it's fine, not same as 535 premium sound but fine."
car_1127,2011 BMW x5-35i need further work,I have recently purchased the new 2011 X5-35i and So Far So Good.I was previously driving a 2010 lexus RX 350. Bought this X5 after much research comparing it with 2010 RX350 and 2011 VW Touareg
car_1128,2013 BMW X6 3.0,"The most amazing crossover that i ever had. It's just a space ship. It's perfect. Do not read dumb reviews on how little space is on the back, or poor rear visibility, there is enough space on the back. I'm 6.2"" and have enough space. Visibility is good. Interior design  is perfect. Exteriors is unforgettable. Handles like a beast. Completely love it. If you want it, buy it."
car_1129,Great Car - Problems with Active Drive,The Active Drive continues to malfunction over and over. This is the 6th time I am taking it to the dealearship to have it fixed...so annoying for a 2013 truck that cost so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
car_1130,Horrible Engine in these cars.,"I purchase this car used, and she was beautiful.  However she came with a list of problems that cost more to repair than the car was worth.  It  started with a smell of fumes coming into the cabin of the car, I brought the car to New Country BMW dealer a number of times to try to get a confirmation of what was wrong with the car and was told antifreeze was leaking and possibly a leaking cylinder head gasket.  Because the dealer could not confirm the leaking gasket, I brought the car to a garage that specializes in foreign cars which gave me a quote of $10,000 to replace leaking Valve Seals, and noted that once they opened the engine they could find additional leaks.  I went back to New Country BMW and explained to them the diagnostic I received, and was told yes these cars are known for leaking valve seals and there is a possibly that the cylinder head gaskets need to be replaced also for an additional $10,000 and $4,000 for the leaking antifreeze repair.  Yes, I brought the car used, but who would think with the original price BMW charges for these vehicles that the engine would get more than 100,000.  I have driven Infiniti's for far over $150,000 miles.."
car_1131,not perfect,"well, wife's X6 sound system is not working , we send it back to the dealer they fix it by installing new software but the problem shown twice, after that i wrote a complain letter to BMW germany after two days our local dealer called me to bring back the car, they said the problem from the amplifier!!they change it under warranty so far the sound system is working until now ,but now i see another problem the back camera somtime not working probably. bmw are nice car but they known of ther reliability issue."
car_1132,BMW X6 2010 Sound issue,"The sound system has started to going off in my car since last 2 months (in the beginning was intermittent but now a day happens so often). I bought my X6 in January and up to ~June I didn't have sound problem. But then later sound started going off (no sound for radio/cd, Reverse-alert, SOS, etc). Sometime restarting the Engine was helpful but not always. BMW Service told me because I had setup the bluetooth with blackberry which has an old version. But even after deleting the blackberry from the phone list and keeping the phone off when in my car I saw sound going off again. I am putting for my car at BMW for second time. I hope they will be able to fix it. I paid $87,000 for this car!"
car_1133,One of the best BMWs yet,I moved into this vehicle from a 6 series and absolutely love it. The 6 is a great car and is a lot of fun so moving to a SAC somewhat scared me but the X6 is awesome. I purchased the performance package so my X6 has an extra 40 horses and it makes the car even more of a beast. I would highly recommend this car to anyone that loves to drive and demands performance from the car.
car_1134,Beauty and the Beast,"I've had the car for almost 3 weeks now, The car has amazing performance its incredibly fast and very smooth, great seats, very comfortable the stereo is great, overall no complaints at all"
car_1135,Love Ride,"I first had a 325CI and that was my first BMW and I loved it, heck I still do, Its a great driving machine. But as I've gotten older, I wanted to upgrade and I thought driving a 6- series was going to be that upgrade that i needed. I saw the X6 and asked to test drive it, and well it was just what i was looking for, not as big as a true SUV but sits up high and larger, while maintaining a 'cool,sporty-look'. I immed. started negotiations, and wrapped e-thing up in about two-three hours. And I can't get enough of driving it!"
car_1136,Awesome Combination,"Came from a porsche + SUV and I wanted to experience both in a single vehicle.  This is it.  The acceleration, handling and feel are hard to believe at first, but you get more confident as you go.  It responds and feels like a sports car at high speed, and like a midsize SUV at slow speeds.  Absolute luxury and comfort.  Looks mean and drives meaner.  Every techno gadget you could want and the best VR and nav in the business.  The interior rivals a 7-series."
car_1137,35i X6,Got it with all the bells and whistles after the 335i coupe had to be turned in for a baby livery!! It's fast and fun!! The navigation is so much better than before.  The active seats are a bit much but the heads-up display is noteworthy!!!!!
car_1138,Amazing 2010 X6 5.0,"My 2010 X6 5.0 is amazing. Fast, plenty of room inside, and something that will challenge a good driver’s skills every day. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay to the BMW X6 5.0 is that it is like playing on a great musical instrument. Know how to play it, and it will reward you with an experience that cannot be described in words."
car_1139,x5 is excellent,"great car in normal use,but just back from 1000 mile fishing trip  it returned 35.4 mpg .First time going off road it goes up steep ,loose grades ,bearly spining a tire. Power is always there no matter what speed. Totally successful execution of an suv"
car_1140,OWNER,A LOT OF RUBBER NOISE ON THE ROAD
car_1141,"Great Driving, poor spacer","If want cargo area for SUV, very disappointing. Previous model much better"
car_1142,Nothing compares,Perfect Ride
car_1143,First full year of enjoyment completed!,"This is my third X5 and they just keep getting better. This 2016 with the 5.0 V-8 is a rocket and handles like a dream. This is my Dailey driver and business car that rides like the 5 series and will pull my fishing boat on the weekends. This is a performance machine so don't expect exceptional mileage. When I drive the interstate at 70- 75 the mileage is 23 but around town 16-17 with all the starting and stops- heavy machine so you should expect it. My last 2012 was the diesel an I got 20 in town and 26 Highway. Amazingly got 12.5 pulling a boat 950 miles to Florida! I like the diesel but wanted a change. I'm a gear head and have a Corvette, so I enjoy performance and handling. You really cannot compare this to another V6 SUV, this V-8 with 440 hp can run with the Porsch SUV for 25k less."
car_1144,Love it,Love it
car_1145,Excellent combination of beauty and beast!!!,"Look out for the features available on X5 like luxury line, 20 inches Y spoke wheels, Premium Package, Harman/ Kardon Surround sound system, Surround view camera etc."
car_1146,Wanted to...,"Looking for a new car to upgrade from my MDX I decided to give the X5 a test.  The car handled wonderfully and felt like driving a much smaller car.  The interior was terrific and felt very luxurious.  The infotainment center seemed to work flawlessly with  a beautiful display.  My big issue with the X5 is the amount of cargo space.  I wanted to love this car so much I was trying to determine if I could overlook the cargo space, but it is just much too small.  I even decided to take with my large cooler on my second test drive to see if I could squeeze everything in.  For such a nice utility vehicle it would be better for BMW to find a way to double the cargo capacity.  A real third row is unnecessary, but real cargo space is."
car_1147,Horrible Gas Mileage- dont believe the  stats from,"I have had the BMW X5 for 7 months.  It rides comfortably.  The voice commands are still iffy and make mistakes.  I speak clearly with no accent and it still makes mistakes, especially on navigating and pulling up your phone contact list.  I drive 50% in traffic in Atlanta and 50% highway driving on GA 400.  The gas mileage on highway never gets above 18 to 19mpg.  The gas mileage in traffic gets 15 to 17mpg.  The average per the computer is 17.3 after 6 months.  I took the car in and the technicians said this is normal and there are no settings to improve the gas mileage other than using eco-boost.  I frequently use the eco-boost mode and it makes about .2mpg difference.  Very little. I am light on the throttle and brakes about 80% of the time, so I don't think that's a big factor. The technician said the advertised mpg from BMW is shown under ideal conditions on a track and going 55 miles per hour.  I wish BMW disclosed this when I first purchased the car. I end up filling my car twice a week now.  My wife's Lexus RX 350 is a comparable SUV and gets about 24 miles per gallon, with similar driving habits and good acceleration.  Its a much better deal.  Corvette gets better gas mileage which is pretty sad.  The only thing I like better about the BMW X5 over the Lexus RX350 is the entertainment system.  Much more intuitive and easier to use in BMW.  If that's not as important to you, then, save some money and get the Lexus."
car_1148,Better than anticipated,Love the car.  Rides better than anticipated.  Looking forward to many years of riding enjoyment.
car_1149,Buy one today!,It is a great vehicle.  Quiet.  Nicely engineered ride.
car_1150,Sports Car In SUV Clothing!!,"This vehicle is amazing! I have the 50i M-Sport w/ 20inch staggered wheels. My previous vehicle was an 2011 BMW 550xi M-Sport. All I have to say with comparing the two is the X5 feels quicker and handles better then the sedan. If you enjoy driving your vehicle like a sports car then you have to option the Dynamic Handling Package. This package makes this vehicle feel like its a 3series. Makes this huge suv very nimble in the corners it's worth every penny. I also love the quality in the interior BMW has come along way with there interiors. Especially with the Mocha Nappa Interior gives the vehicle a very rich feel. I love this SUV in my opinion I don't think there is anything else out there for the price that compares to the X5 for performance, comfort, handling, & safety. I would recommend this SUV everybody!"

car_1154,"Incredible vehicle, effortless steering, swift","Very pricey but worth it!! I do have the 20"" wheels sport package and the ride is a little rougher and will pull some on rutted roads. The sporty look though subdues any worries!! Awesome ride!!"
car_1155,"No regrets, but.....","It's a solid vehicle with good performance and quality.  However, for such a premium SUV, they have omitted or neglected a few features.  Here are a few gripes:  The tail gate will not open by waving your foot under the rear bumper for a completely hands free experience. This feature has been standard on all 5 series since 2012 and is especially useful for an SUV.  After years of developing and updating idrive, why does BMW not update the idrive compatibility and new features (i.e. Apple Play) automatically and remotely via the existing satellite connection?  Why are the front turn signals not LED like the 5 series sedans? We've owned several late model BMW's over the past few years.  We get the impression over the years the design has become more attractive, however the decreasing quality and cost cutting measures are getting more obvious.  We're tempted to try Audi products next time.  Our friends are impressed with their new Q7's and A4."
car_1156,2016 BMW X5 Xdrive 35i,"Updated review November 2017 (25 months after purchase):  Still score it an overall 5 stars.  The more you learn how to use the technologies the better the enjoyment level increases.  I am so glad that we didn't buy the new Volvo XC90 (it needs several years of development and trouble shooting to be compared to the X5).  However, the X5 is not/not the Porsche SUV (which is a driving machine!).  The 2016 X5 35i is overall a 5 star SUV.  Hands down, easy to assess.  I am a ""data miner"" e.g. I research details, options, value, ratings, consumer reports/previous performance, warranties, etc. and I competively shop.  I set our budget at 70K realizing that with all the reasonable extras to include interior and exterior protection, taxes/registration, etc. that the vehicle price is just the beginning.  I spent just over 70K for everything and we have a ""beautiful"" BMW.  I compared the 2016 Audi Q7, the 2016 Volvo XC90, 2016 ML Mercedes Benz, Land Rover LR series, Yukon Denali and the Lincoln Navigator/Cadillac Escalade.  NONE fit into the overall 2016 BMW X5.  I would have joyfully bought any that could stand against the X5 but if this was a mid to large size SUV superbowl, BMW X5 would have the ring!  I built the X5 on-line and the dealership was superb.  BMW service is well above average.  NO REGRETS!  It's strong, luxurious, spacious, reliable, and full of great technology.  Visibility, comfort, etc. is so well designed/engineered.  Highly recommend the contour seats and the premium package options."
car_1157,First BMW and won't be the last. Love the X5,"Overall a great purchase. I tried them all and this one got me by the short hairs. Top notch interior and exterior. A real pleasure to drive. Visibility is fantastic. It might take me two months to learn the electronics, but it's all there. Stunning vehicle."
car_1158,Best BMW X5 Yet,"This is the sixth BMW X5 I have owned and it is the best yet. The stearing  and handeling is fantastic and so smooth and easy, just like driving a car."
car_1159,It's Always Something!!,"I am the second owner of this car and love the style, ride, handling and acceleration of the car.  Purchased as a CPO.   Without  the warranty this car would cost a fortune to own.  The car is 5 years old and has 83000 miles.  It has required an engine overhaul, transmission work and 4 recalls with a fuel pump recall coming once the parts are available.  For the last 10,000 miles the car has needed a quart of oil every 1000 miles, BMW told me  this was normal.  Recently, I needed to add coolant. Brought the car in to address the problem and was told after having the car for 2 weeks, it would need valve seals, engine gaskets and new turbo coolant lines, along with hoses.  Total cost with the warranty 3500.00!!    Service manager told me this is an engine on par with exotics and repairs like this should be expected.  Wish I would have known!!  Will stay away from BMW high end engines in the future, unless I make a killing in the stock market."
car_1160,You better get the extended warranty,"Before you buy a X5 - X6 drive model, you better check out the extended warranty. My 2011 BMW X6 with only 55K miles is currently at the dealership to have the drive shaft / transfer case repaired .  If not for my extended warranty on the car, I would be out $5,000 to $7,000. I got lucky this time, but with less than a year left on the extended warranty, I'm now serioulsy thinking about trading my car in. This most likely will be first and last BMW, love the car, but hate the cost of repairs cost. Last year, I spent $1700 to have the front and rear brake pads replace."
car_1161,"It ain't the ""Leave it to Beaver"" family car","I’m 50 y/o, been married some 29 plus years and through the marriage the newest cars has always gone to the wife until now. Arriving at that new family cycle stage when the children have grown up left home and mini-van has out lived it usefulness. Hence the BMW X6 the next generation “MAN TOYS”; three words to describe it; exclusive, powerful, and stylist. The X6 is not a “Leave it to Beaver” family car but for those who are already to accelerate and say wee through the next stage in life. Weekends the wife and I will just on spur of a moment pack a small bag and hit the road and ride, this car is truly a joy to drive. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE."
car_1162,My snow car is a fun car,"I've had MGs, TR-3, Barracudas, BMW m-coupe, Tesla Roadster Sport -- and none are more fun than the BMW X-6. It rides absolutely flat and smooth (the computer reads and regulates the shocks in microseconds), torque-vectoring kicks the rear end around coming out of a corner, and the performance is exciting. It also gets me home up 2000 feet in five miles, around 42 turns, in 4 inches of snow. It will outdrive any SUV including Porsche. When I ran it in an autocross (nobody autocrosses SUVs) I won my class and came in 26th overall -- on snow tires. Don't believe any of the junk you read about this car. It's brilliant."
car_1163,Projection of unique characteristic,"I've had this car for just about a year now. 2010 model. I use this car to commute and Everywhere I go get a head turn from other people. You may call me an attention seeker. Yes, I enjoy people's stares on my vehicle. In fact, this car offers differentiation from other car owners. I personally think BMW's attempt of making a SAC was pretty bold move, yet succesful one. This car drives like sports sedan and has high view, offers good horse power and torque, but my favorite is the look. I have to say this car isn't for everyone. This car is for the people who's willing to spend money to differentiate oneself from others."
car_1164,It makes sense continued...,"The X6 is a sports car for car enthusiasts who want to drive the car 12 months per year, including snowy months, who need extra room for luggage. Really, fold down those two back seats and you have a two seater with LOADS of space.You have that high seating and massive weight so your wife, bless her soul, isn't going to pee in her pants every time you pass a truck. The car is fast, luxurious and for my needs, eminently practical.The only con is fuel economy.Dave"
car_1165,It makes sense to me,"I was out shopping today for a car to replace my 2009 Mercedes Benz SL550. I've driven sports cars all my life. I like the style, the handling, the thrills. I love my SL but I can only drive it 2/3 of the year because I live on the side of a mountain and there is snow. In the summer, I love to take it on road trips, but luggage space is always an issue and my wife hates highway driving in it. ""Slow down!"" ""Don't pass that truck!"" ""We're too low to the road!"" ""Blah blah blah"". I know you've heard it too.Every review I read about the X6 whines on about how impractical it is, how it has no purpose, no focus. They just don't get it, do they?...continued"
car_1166,Absolutely amazing,"Before I bought this monster, I did my research for almost 2months. I was at a point to purchase a Porsche Cayenne S but it paid to wait. I am totally amazed by the way it rides and what a comfort it offers over Cayenne. Absolutely there is no comparison between Porsche Cayenne and BMW X6 50i. I have looked into almost all high end car manufactures before I finalize this vehicle. I drove Porsche Cayenne, Acura ZDX, Audi Q7, Mercedes ML, Lexus RX400, and Range Rover HSE Supercharge. This BMW X6 is a truly an ultimate driving machine."
car_1167,A Great Decision,Nothing compares. A fantastic driving experience.  This car is truly the ultimate driving machine.  Picked up the BMW i50 X6 and have been totally satisfied.  Traded in a 2011 Porsche Cayenne S!  No comparison this time the BMW IS better than the Porsche (Couldn't say that about my 911 vs M5).  You will be happy with your decision if you purchase one of these.
car_1168,Cargasm...,"Traded in a 2011 Porsche Cayenne S on the BMW 50 X6 and never looked back. Out handles the Porsche!  Faster by a smidge 0.2 to 60 and 0.3 to the quarter mile.  Turns a corner like a alley cat wearing sneakers!  Not as fancy inside as the Porsche, but so much better outside. The Porsche looked like a Murano in the parking lot.  Starts out with 400 HP and BMW will update the ECU with 40 extra ponies for $1350.00. what a deal!"
car_1169,A Big Mistake,"My salesman took me for my test ride on a freshly paved highway and secondary road. I was pleased. I didn't realize this cars Achilles heel until driving off the lot (after the sale) onto a less than perfect road. Minor road imperfections hurl the passenger about the cabin like a rag doll, eventually making one seek out the smoothest routes to avoid this very, very unpleasant ride. It appears BMW engineers could only accomplish the X6's marginal increase in performance by completely sacrificing all other driving aspects expected in a luxury vehicle ride, SUV or otherwise. Unless you only drive on freshly paved, perfectly smooth road surfaces, you will likely regret buying this vehicle."
car_1170,Addicting to drive,"I had this car for only a couple of weeks and so far I have been having a great experience. I drove the car on several long trips and have enjoyed every mile of it. The car is agile, tight, yet very comfortable to drive. Even though I have the smaller engine there is enough oomph to pass or just have some fun accelerating. The heads up display shows all the turns when the navigation is used so your eyes are glued to the road. Quite a neat feature. Parking is a breeze when you have the camera set at top view. You can see all 4 corners and the tires before it hits the curb. Overall an excellent build car. Kudos to BMW engineers."
car_1171,Amazing Car,"This is my first BMW and won't be my last. Coming from a 2010 GS Vette I went with the twin turbo V-8, must say it is as fun to drive as the vette but can take both of my kids with me now. I also love that you don't see too many of these on the road. If you are looking at this car segment...you must test drive this car. I had a 2011 550XI on order, but took the Hybrid X6 the dealer had on the lot for a drive and was sold on the car."
car_1172,Awesome car,"This is most rare car in town or city and I hope keep this way for long time. I am from 325is, 325i, M3, 740il and latest, X6. This is most amazing car ever bought compared to previous cars.  Don't think as X5 but PURE 4dr Coupe Sports car! I LOVE the Design and that is all I needed it even though I have to give my wife and 2 children everyday. Still getting used to X6."
car_1173,Begs to be Driven,"We purchased the 2011 X6, loaded with every option available.  This is my first BMW, but won't be the last.  The car begs to be driven, and is a blast to drive.  The turbo V6 has all the power you'll ever need, especially with the 8 speed transmission. The torque is unreal, but there is slight turbo lag from a dead stop rapid acceleration.  The interior is classy, refined, and very comfortable on long drives.  Around town in every day driving it gets about 17 mpg.  On the high way though, on a recent 250 mile trip we averaged about 26 mpg (not bad for a big vehicle and AWD).  The premium sound system is a must have, unbelievable sound."
car_1174,Incredibly fun,"Been a BMW owner since 1996. These cars keep on getting better and better. I have an X5 4.4 V8 and now the owner of an X6 (still kept the X5).  In short having the X6 35idrive (diesel), i can honestly say that i do miss the oomph of the v8, though the gas consumption is way better 10.8 L/100 km. It is economically better, and way cheaper gassing up once every 10 days vs 5 days with the V8.  So apart from the get and up and get em, v8 power what do i miss. Nothing, great car, great steering, incredibly great seats, incredibly great car. Few around and the owners are proud. Hard to park though, apart from that highly recommended you will get signs of approval from all. It is a modern marvel."
car_1175,Fun SUV,"The BMW X5, especially with the V8,  is a engaging car to drive."
car_1176,2012 BMW X5 Issues too many already! Disappointed.,"Bought it used 58k miles , first day the battery died, took it to BMW dealer, labor+parts+programming  $475, called the dealer i bought it from (not BMW car dealer)and they sent me the check for the full amount.After 2 months engine overheating, towed the car to the dealer, water bump +thermostat +flushing coolant and a few more flushing all trans, etc  plus aliment, $1800 for water bump and thermostat+ the other things  all together came up to $2500 after$300 discount, we went to pickup the car asked for discount and got the bill down to $1978.very very disappointed about the quality of BMW, shame on them.I went to the dealer i bought the used car from and requested they pay for the issue under the New York lemon law, waiting for them to get back to me.I decided to buy extended warranty 5years/100k which comes first , covers almost everything(engine,turbocharge,trans,brakes,drive axle,steering,gasket,seals,brakes,electrical,a/c) , for $3700 plus tax comes up to $4000.Do you think I did the right thing by getting warranty(already in two month and cost me $2500 to fix twice)? Is it a good price for the plan?Anyone has any similar issues and experience etc..?Found this article online"" BMWs are reliable, but Japanese cars actually have a better track record. BMW models are officially rated “average” or “below average” by auto magazines and hobbyists. Though the company promises long intervals between servicing, the fact is that their turbocharged models often have more problems more often""For reliability, it is below average according to Consumer Reports. The main problems occur in the electrical system and the cooling system for the engine. It rated even lower in the J.D. Power and Associates study, which gave the 2012 X5 just two out of five stars. This study found most problems in the electrical and cooling systems, as well as slight problems with the engine.So be aware BMW buyers !! My second car is a Honda and it drives and feels better than BMW!! And its half the BMW price brand new !"

car_1178,Incredibly expensive to maintain the V8 Bi-Turbo,"Constantly requiring expensive maintenance. Bought with 60K miles in 2015. Have spend $10,000 -- and this it at least 1/3 less than what the dealer would charge. EVERYTHING requires massive labor and parts are amazingly expensive. My 6th BMW, but my first V8 Bi-Turbo."
car_1179,Love It AND Hate It,I have owned this vehicle for 14 month.  It has been on a flatbed truck FOUR times!!!! Thermostat failure caused car to shut down while I was driving on the parkway - stuck for 3 hours.Brakes seized and calipers would not free the front wheels - stuck for 2 hours.Coolant reservior EXPLODED - coolant everywhere - stuck for 3 hours.Oil Tank EXPLODED - oil EVERYWHERE - stuck for 3 hours.The only saving grace is that my local dealership has excellent service and has provided me with a loaner vehicle every time mine was in the shop (it has gotten to the point that I feel it needs repairs whenever it is dirty so I at least get a free wash out of it....).  The X5 is pretty.  It handles very well.  It has great pick-up and braking capacity.......but it has ZERO reliability.  NEVER AGAIN!
car_1180,Not for Family,"High tech high performance and safe and overal uncomfortable, sporty and rough drive and very hard steering  !"
car_1181,How BMW lost a 15 year customer,"We bought two X5's, one in 2001, one in 2011. The 2012 X5 has 28K miles on it and warranty expired in October '15. In early October, the car called BMW and said service was required. We took it and they could not say what service was needed. We told them to replace the wipers since we were there on our $1,000+ extended service plan. So far we have gotten two sets of wipers and two oil changes for our $1000. Don't buy that plan from them. It covers little. In December '15 the vehicle was leaking oil in the garage. They determined it was leaking from a hose going to the turbocharger and fixed it as a courtesy beyond the warranty period at no charge. 45 days later it was leaking again in the same spot in the garage. This time it was determined that the turbocharger needed replaced. They agreed to replace it with a 5% deductible of $263. Each trip there is painful. The service department is grossly understaffed. Today there was one adviser there, with a line waiting to see her. She was literally running, doing her best. After a 10 minute wait to pay and a 10 minute wait to get the vehicle, I was out. The car smells like glue really strong. I got an appraisal too, no longer having peace of mind. Our $60K car is now worth $24K after 4 years and 4 months, and 28,000 miles. BMW no longer holds it's value. Our 15 years of BMW loyalty are at an end. The quality of product has declined, and the dealer experiences are time consuming and frustrating. BMW is supposed to give you peace of mind and the ultimate driving experience. For us, they have failed. We went back to the dealer for a seat calibration warning in April 2017. Service department did good work. We waited while work was done and browsed the showroom. Salesman all around their central kiosk. After looking at new X5s I asked a salesperson a question about the new technology package. He told me to look on line for details. No interest in selling a new car (which would be a hard sell based on our X5 quality issues."
car_1182,"Great car ,reliable  ,fun to drive","Since 2012 I own my BMW x5 . I got it new ,Other then free regular service I had never had any problem with the car, it's fun to drive , the navigation system needs improvment ,"
car_1183,Glad I Chose a 2012 BMW X5 Diesel,"I bought this car about 2 years ago. Interested in better gas mileage but something that also offered me luxury and power, I decided to buy the 2012 X5 diesel. I'm glad I did. My car is sleek, plush, extremely well-built and runs perfectly. What I like about the diesel, too, is that it keeps getting better gas mileage as I break it in. I feel safe in my BMW and pampered. Thanks to my BMW's excellent steering and speed, I was saved from (and avoided) what could have been a life-altering accident. I've never been so impressed with a vehicle--so was my friend, who was also saved. This was an excellent choice for me, and going to the facility in South Carolina was icing on the cake."
car_1184,Confidence in the Passing Lane,"On the highway, in the passing lane….this is where the BMW X5 sets itself apart.It holds the lane so well and it WANTS to go fast. It is so comfortable on a long trip home from the ski slopes. But there is a trade-off. While it may blow the doors of a Lexus GX in the passing lane, it will spend seemingly 3x as much time in the repair shop having annoying stuff fixed and warning lights turned off."
car_1185,BMW does not protect electronics from melted snow or grocery spills in the cargo area,Do not let the BMW perception for reliability deceive you. Common place expectations for simple engineering rigor to protect consumers from costly repairs due to liquid damage is not a part of the BMW reputation. If you are considering purchasing a BMW think twice. The marketing team was responsible for the final decision not to repair over $1300.00 in damage due to electronics placed along the drip path for liquid spills in the rear cargo area of the X5d. The electronic connectors were placed in a position so that the cup is turned in a way to catch liquids. There are no protective nor preventative measures to prevent liquids from entering and destroying critical expensive electronics.
car_1186,1.5 Year BMW X5 experience,"Let me provide you with the list of problems i faced one after the other.1. Dashboard failed within 3 months.2.State inspection failed within 12 months, tires gone and no support from BMW. Very poor customer care.3. Door from driver side failed, wouldn't work with keyless entry.4. Here comes the worst one, engine malfunction. God saved my life on a highway where my X5 suddenly gave this error message on dashboard screen and stopped suddenly on highway, where 2 big trailers were just behind me. Very scarey. 5. Low battery message in just 16 months."
car_1187,"Love it, but....","This is a great SUV in every aspect except one, in Illinois it's impossible to find diesel that meets the requirement of not exceeding 5% bio content. Illinois doesn't tax diesel if it has more than 11% bio content. So no fuel stations carry fuel with a lower content.All pumps that I've seen state 5-20% bio content.Same issue with every Audi, VW and Mercedes."
car_1188,Fuel Pump issue and putting on a hitch aftermarket,"I love the way this car drives but after 10,000 miles it broke down on the side of the road.It was a fuel pump issue which I've heard has been a consistent issue with the X5. My friend said they are replacing it with the same fuel pumps so she ended up having it happen again and got rid of her car.I also opted to put a hitch on aftermarket but beware it may cause serious problems with your lease return since they have to actually break off a piece of the bumber to put it on so you would get dinged when turning in the lease. I opted to use the tow clips with a BMW bike rack which carries 2 bikes (can opt for a 3rd tray but it would be tight) and it's a fantastic bike rack."
car_1189,Back to BMW for more space for new baby.,"Very pleased with the car so far after 2 weeks. Switched from a 2010 Range Rover Sport with the 5.0 V8 but the car is just as fast - different power delivery. Fuel economy in a different league.Ride quality is much better than the RRS both on 20"" wheels.Handling is much more sedan than SUV. Convenience features on the BMW are leagues ahead of the RRS. Electronics are so much better thought out and things like the power lift tailgate etc make a big difference when you have a small one.Last BMW was a diesel X5 in the UK ten years ago, was one of the best cars I've ever had.Mine is actually a 2013 model not that there are any changes."
car_1190,Yes to BMW X5,"The 2005 BMW X5 is my first BMW.I was amazed at how fun this car was to drive.The X5 is a sports car, not an off road vehicle.Don't buy this car if you intend to do a lot of off road driving.The X5 handles like a dream even at high speeds.The top speed is about 128 MPH.At 128 MPH the x5 handles like my Land Rover did at 70 MPH.Speed and handling are definately the X5's best features.The X5 is dependable.If you have any problems it will be with the electrical system.BMW has power plant, drivetraine and suspension down pat.They have a few things to learn when it comes to electronics.I have had problems with tail lights and electric door locks."
car_1191,Very Nice,"Just bought my x5 2/3/12 and simply love it. Drove the SRX, and Q7 and when I drove the X5 it sold me right on the spot. Great handling, though a bit tight in the steering but the rest of the pros were great.Ken"
car_1192,Fun to drive but have software issues,"I took delivery of my X5 4.4L V8 in January 2012. The performance and body design of this vehicle are without a doubt awesome. It's interior layout and idrive system are equally impressive. Nonetheless, I am disappointed with the rear entertainment system. My DVD player will activate when initially placing a DVD in the player (when the vehicle is on), However it will not resume play using the DVD play button. Additionally, the DVD player volume control button does not work. I was informed by one of the local BMW service departments that the problem is a software issue and that BMW is seeking a solution."
car_1193,"Expensive, but Very Nice",Picked mine up at the BMW performance center in S.C.Excellent experience and highly recommended to anyone purchasing a BMW SUV.I got to push the car a little and it truly let me know how safe this car is on the road.Sold my 2011 Audi Q5 2.0T and it was well worth the move.
car_1194,Don't want to drive anything else.,"I have been driving BMWs since 10 years. The diesel X5 is so far, and by far the best BMW, I have driven. Car moves like a sedan with the power of diesel engine. It's the best option to buy in the USA Market."
car_1195,Great vehicle!,"I have had my X5 for 4 months now and it is a dream to drive. I get approximately 18.3 mpg in mostly city driving. It handles the snow very well. The x-drive is amazing. Great handling, great acceleration but there is a slight turbo lag which does not bother me. The iPhone hookup is great. Music sounds great on the premium sound system. Seats are very comfortable and supportive with the comfort seat option. The vehicle is very ""smart"" and has lots of electronic customizations available through the iDrive. The iDrive is abit overwhelming at first but after a week or so one can figure it out with ease. Ventilation is great in front and back. Exterior fit and finish is impeccable."
car_1196,New X5,"Just purchased my first BMW. Previously drove Infiniti M35X. Also considered new Mercedes M Series, Porsche Cayenne, and Mercedes E Class, but liked X5 too much to wait for the new Mercedes M. IDrive system has been relatively easy to learn. Owned car for several weeks now. Great freeway vehicle. Good overall comprise between sporty ride close to a typical german sedan and interior room of SUV -- all in a medium size overall package that is reasonable to park/maneuver in an urban environment. Very satisfied so far."
car_1197,good car,"As with all BMW's, the quality of the car is good.I think (especially compared to the Lexus LS I traded for this) that the Idrive is very easy to use.The only thing I don't ""get"" at all is the electronic transmission shifter.Instead of clicking into gear, it's basically a switch.You have to squeeze the buttom on top and one on the side to put it in park rather than just shifing to park.Sometimes I don't push the buttons right and it doesn't go into park and I lurch forward."
car_1198,LOVIN' MY 2012 BIMMER,"We have had 12 brand new cars in ten years-if I had bought my X-5 ten years ago I wouldn't have owned so many different models. I Just upgraded from a 2010 BMW X-3 due to having a second child and needing the extra space.We are currently stationed in Germany and so we got our X-5 tax free(yes we pay tax to license it in some states; still doesn't come close to $63,000 USA price-and they're built in the USA. The benefits of the technology and drive far outweigh any cons people would put on this vehicle. If you have a problem with the I-drive, then you need to take computer classes. The computer is easier to operate than any GPS that I've ever owned. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!"
car_1199,Excellent & fun to drive,"Had this 2012 X5 for over 3 weeks and put 1200 mi already. Used to drive 525i now got this X5 for the 3rd row. Though it's a truck the drive is more like a sedan. Never felt the higher CG during turns. This a BMW in all aspects and make you feel at home if you had driven any BMW before. luxury, performance & looks of course. The only issue I faced is the lag (1 to 2 secs)between you hit the pedal and picking up speed. There's no lag from a stop and go but when you are at 50 and want to jump to left lane or pass someone you will feel it. Once it picks up then it can go to 80 and 90 without sweat and very stable at such higher speeds. Not so much of an issue for a calculated-fun driver."
car_1200,VW TDI Sport-Wagon Replacement,Good VW TDI Sport-Wagon Replacement
car_1201,"My $600 phone is easy to use $39,000 car is not","The car handles well and really shines on a 2 lane highway. Lags between 0-5 mph which is mildly annoying but otherwise is OK. I like the gas mileage and it is comfortable in the driver's seat. The problems: 1. Navigation - slow to acquire satellites and then 5 minutes later will alter your route based on traffic, this is sometimes too late to take a better route. My phone is much better. Also, if you decide to go a different route the system will keep trying to reroute you back to the original rather than recalculating. Once I went 70 miles and passed into the upper in Michigan before it recalculated. I was recently sent a notice that I could upgrade to current maps for $59 annually. This is pretty funny. 2. The bluetooth phone works OK, but it takes a minute or two to reload the phonebook from my phone each time. Why? Again my phone is better. At least the car bluetooth will pick up the call after I have made it on my phone. 3. Hands free control - you can speak controls but you have to know the exact sequence of words, for example for an address, you can't easily search for anything else, this is not really useful. Bottom line is that BMW should hire some Samsung or Apple engineers. Not sure I would buy again but would consider if they caught up with Fords on technology front."
car_1202,Awesome Ride,"I got this car trading in a 2013 Jetta Sportwagen TDI polluter and could not be happier, even though I took a beating on the trade in value, thanks to VW's fraudulent practices.  We'll see if they ever make it right, but, I'm over it.  This BMW is an incredible machine.  It feels solid, looks fantastic outside, clean and elegant inside with wood trim and, most important, it is really, really fun to drive -- super responsive with a kick that will throw your head back in fourth gear, great acceleration from a dead stop, awesome handling, sweet engine sounds, just a beautiful little beast.  I've got a C7 Corvette, manual with sports package and this thing compares favorably in terms of driving dynamics.  I mean, driving to work every morning is a treat, not a chore.  My particular x1 is a loaded M Sport 35i -- don't think there's anything it hasn't got.  It's real comfortable inside -- I'm 6'1"" and find the front seat roomy.  The controls are easy to use and the infotainment system I like much better than the one on the Corvette -- shorter learning curve, more intuitive.  I have no idea what the mileage is and don't care, really.  Whatever they say it is, I'm sure mine is much less because of the way I drive.  I did try the eco-boost thing and it does improve mileage -- there's a little readout that tell you how much, but, when it's on, the car doesn't drive like a BMW.  I think it's good for long highway trips when you're just going along at the speed limit for hours, but when you're actually driving the car, forget it.  You don't buy a car like this to save on gas.  For that, get a Prius.  So, bottom line, I am totally sold on this car.  I hate the fact that, for 2016, BMW ruined it, making it front wheel drive and sticking you with the smaller engine and the eight speed transmission, but, hey, I got the sweet spot, seems like and I will keep this car for a very long time.Update 8/3/17 Everything above is still true.  I'm always thinking about cars, but there is just no way I could sell this BMW.  I took it for a road trip earlier this year and it was great on a long drive, comfortable and, for me, the absolutely perfect size.  Looks like I'm stuck with it.  By the way, these cars are very hard to find.  I friend of mine wants one just like it and we looked regionally and, tricked out like mine, didn't find one."
car_1203,Great AWD wagon,"I love my 2015 X1, and more so after driving a 2016. The 2015 X1 has a unique style and look that maintained classic BMW driver focused interior and handling. The Valencia orange makes the curves on the exterior pop. She handles beautifully and has been very dependable. The new X1 interior drives me nuts! It's cheesy! The 2015 is sleek and serious compared to the weird seat and dash configuration in the newer models. The 2015 knows what it's about and the 2016 is confused by trying to satisfy all the criticisms of the ignorant American car critics!"
car_1204,X1 a poor man's Macan S,"We needed to replace our car in the mountains for our vacation home and decided on the BMW X1 SAV. This is our 1st BMW (currently I drive a Porsche 997 C2 Cab and my wife drives a Porsche Cayenne S at our main home) and initially after test driving liked it (but I was leaning toward a Volvo V60 Cross Country...but was unable to work out the deal that I wanted) but after driving it for 2 weeks I more than like it! Amazing performance (for a turbo 4) and great gas mileage. Handling is superb....not my 911 type of handling...as it is not a sports car, but for what it is and for it's price tag superb. The best I have driven up to the Macan (which is in a totally different category all together!). There are a few downsides which are lack of storage inside the vehicle (ours is a 2015 and I have been told that it has been somewhat rectified with the 2016 year model) and...maybe just 1 downside then! Very happy so far."
car_1205,Underwhelmed....ho...hum.,"Sure, its got sporty get-up-and-go and handling, but that is where the over-achievement ends.Otherwise, its just ""OK"" as far as luxury brand vehicles go.A quick list of the less-than-optimal ""features"":-windows VERY quick to fog up when heat is on-limited back-seat leg-room-HD radio degraded within 1st year-initially very quiet and within 6 months became significantly louder-computer system frequently alerting (then not alerting) that all 4 tires were either low and/or flat and then not alerting on this-computer system frequently alerting that radiator fluid was needed (within months of purchasing car and after adding fluid) and then not alerting on this"
car_1206,Not happy,"Number of things that bother me.1. front door handles will pinch the fire out of your fingers if you are not careful.2. after 600 miles the car only gets 18.2 mpg in Dallas traffic.  8 miles below what they say it should get.3. not much of a pickup4. wheel base porpoises a lot.UPDATE ON 3/8/2016 -  MPG is still crappy for this type of vehicle , plus what is reported by BMW.  Front door handles are poorly designed.  Will really pinch you, if not careful.  Now have about 1700 miles on automobile.  Would not buy one again.Just had interesting experience on this vehicle on 6/25/16.  Had nail in left rear tire, and it could not repaired. Found out that there are 3 run flat tires which cannot be repaired and you have to buy a new one.   The BMW X1 uses Pirelli, and that is one of the 3.  Be sure, before you buy, to find if your run flats can be repaired.  Very important.Update on 6/28/17 - still not happy with gas mileage, as advertised.  yesterday, it 17.2 for a tank of gasoline."
car_1207,Sport Hatchback that BMW doen't technically make,"I know that everyone is jumping in the small crossover SUV pool but the X-1 (in my opinion) doesn't really strike me as an SUV.  What it strikes me as is a 3 Series of 2 generations ago, re-imagined as a sport hatchback.  I've had mine for a couple months and I really couldn't be happier with my decision.  Mine is loaded: Ultimate package, X-Line package, Adaptive Xenon Lighting package, Cold-weather package, etc. but I bought it as a dealer demo with 6,800 miles on it so it was about $8,000 or so below sticker.  We are empty-nesters and my wife has a Ford Explorer so I really could have gotten by with a smaller sport sedan or even a coupe (I test drove both).  However, I am a cyclist and backpacker so having a bit more utility in the vehicle I drive every day kind of put the X-1 over the top for me.  Plus the price was lower than a 3 series or a 228i AND I really don't feel like I gave up much in the way of driving dynamics.  With 240hp and 260 lb/ft of torque, there is simply gobs of power on tap in this 3,500 lb car.  I got the rwd version (we don't get much snow if any) so it handles like a true German sports sedan.  It's shorter (nose-to-tail), narrower and lighter than the 3 Series wagon and it's like 9 inches shorter (in height) than the X3 so it really is more of a hatchback than a wagon or SUV.  I also like that it has 7"" of ground clearance: not enough to introduce too much lean in the corners, but enough to not have to worry about hitting curbs and parking barriers in parking lots.  It's a very nice touring car on your favorite 2 lane hwy (or even the interstate) and it scoots around town or back roads as zippy as you want to.  It has plenty of headroom in front and back.  Negatives?  Leg room in the back is a bit tight for adults, only 2 will comfortably ride in the back (due to the transmission tunnel), and there's a bit too much wind and road noise on the interstate for a BMW (in my opinion--having owned BMWs before).  All of that I can live with because the virtues of this car far outweigh the negatives."
car_1208,"Goldilocks Size, Gold Bullion Price","Replaced our 325iT because the new ""Sportwagons"" only came in AWD - out of our price range, heavy, and lower performance. A base model is affordable by BMW standards, but to get the rear-view camera, we had to buy the costly nav and ""driver assist"" packages. (This may not be true with the new X1 that's on the Mini chassis.) The best interior (IMO) is the extra cost Terra/Petrol leather (Milk chocolate with white/blue piping) which only came with the extra cost XLine Package that included 18 inch lower profile (harsher riding and more expensive to replace) tires. Not really for a large family of large people, but for our purposes, occasionally carrying four normal size adults, it's perfect. All that said, we stretched our budget for a well optioned car with a sticker of $49,500 and we love it. Downside: It came with run-flat tires, unrepairable, harder-riding and expensive to replace. The newer X1s can be had with a limited-service spare and non-run-flat tires."
car_1209,Still satisfied but not amazed,"After 30,000  miles in good and bad weather, I would say I'm satisfied but not amazed with the X1. This SAV is responsive and handles well. I was impressed with the stability in snow and ice. My disappointment is mostly with the base bluetooth interface. Old technology and not what should be standard on a premium vehicle.Like the transmission, hate the shifter. Is it a great value? Is it the best vehicle of its type? Perhaps not. It is my 5th BMW and 2nd currently owned. (Z4) something keeps bringing me back. If not the ultimate driving machine, it's a drivers vehicle and you don't get that from a subaru. Enough said. Update: 24,000 miles, MPG is avg24. On highway not any better. Gear selector is terrible and for this price point the Bluetooth should be much better. Overall, it's okay just not great. Least inspired of the 5 BMWs I've owned."
car_1210,fun exciting peppy little cuv - very pleased.,"Very cool good looking high build quality vehicle with peppy engine and precise steering with good road feel but still highly comfortable and luxurious. If you are not looking for a big vehicle, then this is definitely the one to get since it is more practical than a sedan like 3-series, but with all its fun. It is not cheap as some people suggest - if you add up all the options that are standard on 3-series, it gets more expensive than a 3-series. So in that sense it is better since the options are just that - optional."
car_1211,quick and nimble with no cost maintenance.  sign me up.,"i have now 13k miles on my X1. i got the 4 cylinder but it is very quick with 250lb torque. steering is precise and after 13k miles there is no problem and tires and brakes are fine.  person wrote brakes gave out after 1,000 miles?  he must be a cadillac dealer.  there is no way they give out and if they did BMW replaces them.  the start stop feature saves gas but it's optional to use.  i turn it off mostly so i can have more fun but it is optional, so it's not an issue.  the back seat is small.  the cargo is small.  it is not an SUV.  it's a cross over."
car_1212,BMW X6 Disappointment,"The vehicle pulls which makes the drive very stressful.  You have to keep a firm grip with two hands on the steering wheel at all times....not a luxury drive.  Bought brand new from Braman Motors in West Palm Beach, what a disappointment.  Been thru several service advisors, vehicle in multiple times for pulling.  Broken promises and lied to on what they touched on my vehicle - don't trust their paperwork, they don' t put everything on the paperwork.   This is my 5th BMW and I've never been through anything like this, friends are leary after my experience and two refused to lease again when their leases were up. I strongly suggest you be very cautious, the luxury experience is not what it once was."
car_1213,Disappointing vehicle,"I purchased the car as a CPO and it has spent over 40 days at the dealership in the first 7 months. While the car performance is amazing, build quality and comfort are really bad. The car is incredibly noisy on the road and all the plastics creak. Also the entertainment system is really disappointing for such an expensive vehicle. First and last BMW. Way over rated and overpriced."
car_1214,X5 Diesel 2013 is a game changer!,"This is the most affordable, reliable , gas efficient  Luxury car in the market.  The 2013 BMW X5 Diesel had all the issues that the previous diesel resolved and is the perfect car. If you were making a decision between this car and the new look of a 2014 BMW X5 Diesel. I would suggest stick with the 2013 or go for a 2017 which will cost you. I am amazed by the 28 Miles per gallon, solid, luxury, powerful reliable car. Is this is your first diesel car you may have to get used to the hum of a diesel engine. However after 3 weeks you will find it hard to drive a car that does not produce that solid power humming diesel noise.   This is the best luxury car, I have ever won"
car_1215,Overall good midsize SUV.,"Ride is firm, but handles more like a car than a truck."
car_1216,"CPO purchase, no big complaints, but updated","We wanted to buy a new one in 2010, but they were just a little too high for anything but a diesel, and we were wary of diesel price swings, the different character of that engine, and being able to pull into a pump anywhere at a busy station back when diesel was less common.   Years later, we found that many diesel versions had reliability issues.    But in terms of all-around ability (ride, handling, acceleration, comfort, utility, towing ability, looks) it was still our favorite 6 years later.  It handles fantastic for such a large heavy vehicle.  You can feel the weight but the huge tires grip like crazy.  The SAV version is definitely the one to get, it looks great, and gives a feeling of confidence in turns and at speed that most others just do not.   Utility is good, not great, with over 70 cu ft of cargo area with seats down.  They don't fold flat, which is disappointing (we have dogs), but there is plenty of room for a road trip with 4 dogs, 2 people, and luggage.   A family of four would do ok.  It can also tow a fairly heavy trailer, but I installed my own hitch and wiring as the BMW version is outrageously expensive.  Took 2 hours, so there's no valid reason for their exorbitant labor charges, as they should be able to do it in half the time.  Ride is firm but not harsh, though big bumps will be felt.   It is a better ride than our Volvo S60 R design sport sedan, but those seeking a luxury smooth ride should look elsewhere.   It is surprisingly quiet for a vehicle like this.  Seat comfort is better for the thin shouldered, as the bolsters do press a little on my broad back at the lats.  The thigh extension is a must-have.  Xenons make visibilty good at night, and there are no blind spots to worry about.   Throttle tip in is actually slower than it should be, you have to punch it to get power in regular transmission mode.  It doesn't seem to be turbo lag (max torque comes in at just 1250 rpm) but a throttle tip in issue.  Acceleration is good, not breathtaking, but more than enough for regular driving, especially at speed.  Handling is very confidence inspiring and curvy mountain roads won't raise the hairs on your back like in most crossovers or SUVs.  Not too far from a sport sedan and better than most mundane sedans.   Very handsome vehicle, materials are good, and our 3 year old example looked practically new.   Many others we looked at didn't fare so well.  We paid $37,000 for one with 34K miles and it still has one year of bumper to bumper and 2 more years of CPO coverage.   With taxes and the hitch we have $39K in it.  It stickered for about $69,000 so that's a nice savings.   It had an airbag recall that was fixed before we got it but otherwise the history was clean.   There was no spare on this one which is unfortunate, but those temp spares are so limited in range and speed that it wasn't of much use anyway on long trips.   The interior design is handsome but not beautiful.  Ergonomics are typical BMW, with a learning curve for some functions like cruise and the computer.  The NAV is useful but like most, not always great.  The iDrive controller is fairly easy to use now and fairly logical, though one can still get screens not doing what you want when choosing the split screen or wanting to display your songs when you are also navigating, etc.   Tons of brake dust, like all BMWs.  But a very solid feeling vehicle and great build quality.  Conceptually this is the closest to a ""does it all"" vehicle that one can find.    Sporty, good looking(in SAV trim), good handling, quiet, reasonable ride quality, safe, spacious, and  reasonable comfort.    My only fix would be to add the luxury comfort seat option, as the sport seats are supportive but a little firm compared to our Volvos.  But anything will be less comfortable than Volvo seats.    Only those who value solid handling and sporty aspirations should bother paying the price, as there are plenty of bigger or more cushy rides available for less.  We just want the confidence it gives at high speed and the active safety of great handling and braking for the class.UPDATE:   Steering is actually over-heavy, in parking situations the wide tires and heavy steering actually make your arms ache while backing a trailer.    It ""feels"" as heavy as it is, and so unless you need the extra space, the X3 is probably a better choice for driving enthusiasts, but really a wagon would be best of all. Unfortunately they make only the 3 series wagon and I find its seats too narrow. The X5 seats are wide.    It's very solid at speed, but not nimble."
car_1217,Overrated,"Disappointed in run flat tires which give rough ride and are very expensive to replace! No oil dipstick and worst of all, no coolant temp gauge. Dealer is great but car is overpriced and under delivers on performance and value versus the 10 previous BMWs I have owned over the last 40 yrs! Sold the car back to dealer in October 2016 due to inability to get Takata airbag replacement done in abtimely manner and wanted the remainder of my $4800 6yr/100,000 mile warranty money back so I made out alright! I replaced it with a loaded 2017 Ford Explorer Sport which cost me 10,000 less than the X5 and had superior power, handling, comfort and has performed flawlessly over 16,000 miles and one year so far. Lots of nice touches the BMW didn't have and the extended warranty was $2000 instead of almost 5000! Bye bye BMW!"

car_1223,diesel hot rod,"I love this vehicle! Plenty of power(diesel).Tried all diesels and picked the x5 because it came close to my hemi powered vehicle.The ride and steering are firm because this is a performance car not a comfort car.I have my foot in it a lot and still average 23 mpg.Outside finish is top shelf, interior design is very friendly but the gaps and joints are not so good for the price.Plenty of storage(3rd seat would be mistake).Unless you have a lot of money stay away from the staggered wheel setup.Tires cannot be rotated.The spare tire is a must have.Just because its a BMW dealership does not mean good service,shop and compare.More options means more issues.Choose wisely and enjoy! Just over 50,000 mile and still no complaints. Keyless remote does like to make its own decisions sometime's."
car_1224,BMW Assist - Waste of money,"The engine of the X5 with ~4000 miles died while on the highway. When I pulled over the car smelled like a burning electrical fire. I called BMW/Assist - Wow the worst service over. It took numerous call, two tow trucks, and 4.5 hours to get home. You will get A+ service from GM/OnStar or Ford MySync, or AAA. BMW roadside was a joke. They screwed up just about every aspect of my SOS call. Stay away from BMW Assist. You will not be happy at all. Free for 4 years means nothing if they can't help."

I know the diesel hassome issue with expensive fixes.But the 2014 is going to have a revised diesel sofelt would be better off on the last run ofthe current motors. Build quality yes it goodbut have found some of the plastic pieces creak and pop,not what expect in a 70KSUV.So did not go a 5 in quality.But thisE70 has good visibility, good seating heights.Course got the multi contour seats."
car_1226,My first BMW,"This is a great vehicle, as well as my first BMW. If you learn how to drive the X5 properly you can achieve the MPG figures, and even exceed them, the vehicle has done surprisingly well on gas mileage. The car has been totally reliable and it's performance has been very impressive, it really does handle like a BMW sports sedan, not a big SUV. It is comfortable and feels very solid and secure, even at very high freeway speeds, and it's practicality and space are very much appreciated on a daily basis. I have the M performance and sport packages and they really do make the vehicle look and feel amazing! I would recommend the X5 to anyone looking for a great luxury SUV."
car_1227,Think twice before buying a 2013 X5,"This is my 3rd BMW and it is the worst vehicle I have ever owned.I am an active mail and find it physically exhausting to drive because of the tight steering wheel.If your normal driving pattern includes a lot of stop and go's; you will find the transmission hesitates.The road noise is louder than my Toyota pickup truck, not to mention the ride is stiffer than my pickup truck.Here is my advice, if you are seriously interested in this vehicle don't make the same mistake I did by taking it for an around the block test drive.Ask thedealer to loan the X5 to you for the weekend and drive it where you live!I own 4 vehicles & this is the last one out of the garage!"
car_1228,Read this first before you buy.,"Pros: Nice looking, nice navigation, sound system, automatic headlights are nice, especially if you drive a lot on rural or less busy roads like myself. If there is any traffic on the highway they will not activate.Cons: - Biggest disappointment for my 72K car is the engine. Base engine is barely adequate. The 6 cylinder engine will struggle to move the car. I have never had a car that goes over 6000 RPM to the red zone every time I merge to the highway. Do not expect sporty performance.- LED headlight are cool looking, have whiter shade than HIDs, and they may last longer but they are not any brighter than HIDs on other cars. They are not worth the extra money.- The hand break does not engage well. The car will always roll down a few inches after stopping the engine, even in park and engaging the hand break. I park on slightly steep drive and I never with this issue. - The electric shift knob is not precise. You will not feel the shifts. It does not have the secure click like in my Mercedes. I must take my eyes off the road to make sure I am in the right gear, or I will be revving the engine in neutral, or moving when I was supposed to be in neutral. - The button that activate and deactivate auto shut off when stopped is too small and too close to ignition. The problem is that they are both hidden under the steering wheel, you may push both with your thumb if you do not look and then you would have the engine shutoff unexpectedly on the first stop. - The A/C is very weak. I never had to put the A/C on MAX cold in any car before and I do not like strong A/C. It might be fine if you live in the northern states. I live in the south and the A/C will only be fine on cooler days. On hot days, exactly when you need it, it will take 30-minute highway drive on MAX cold to cool off the car. - The blind spot monitor only works on relatively higher speed, I believe something like 30 miles/hr. It is not useful in busy slower traffic.- The seats are not comfortable. I have the higher-end seats they can be adjusted in many ways. I can never find them comfortable. - There is a front camera which I was excited to see. I thought it would help to see what is right in front when you park. It is absolutely useless. It will show exactly what you normally see ahead of you without leaning forward. You will not be able to view anything below to hood level.  It is probably mounted in the windshield at the eye level rather than on the front grille where it could have been useful."
car_1229,"Solid SUV, Great Hybrid Performance","This plugin hybrid is the future of European car makers' product lines. The paired gas and electric engines with overnight charging make for an uncompromising vehicle. The standard X5 gets low 20s MPG with a normal mix of city and highway driving. With this X5 40e plugin hybird, we charge once per day and have been averaging 45 MPG per tank. The car is confident and handles great, possibly due to the lower center of gravity with the heavy battery. Charging overnight is easy with a standard 120V household plug. For $500-$1000 you can install a 3.8 KWh ""level 2"" charger at home to cut down the charge time from ~8hours down to about 2.5 hours. And there are lots of great parking perks at public lots when you're in an electric car, frequently with the option to charge for free. (Public charging is sometimes pay-for-charge and costs less than $2.00). Overall the vehicle is extremely comfortable, high performing, easy to drive, and well appointed with premium leather, metal trim, and real woods. It's an expensive vehicle, but not a bad value."

car_1234,2016 BMW X6 xDrive 35i Carbon Black Metallic,"After owning and driving this car for almost one year here is my take on it. First let me say that I was sold on this car before the salesman pulled over to let me drive it purely  based on how comfortable the upgraded seats were and how powerful it felt on the road. Quiet, powerful, and a very smooth acceleration. The 5.0 or M version is tempting, but really not necessary for me because this car gets out of its own way quickly. It seats five with ease, and unless you are over 6'5"" the back seat is perfectly fine, and I have not had any problems filling up the rear with a ton of groceries. I own the M sport, loaded with options that are actually very easy to use and I usually do. The navigation screen is huge and clear.  I like the sloping roof line and M sport molding much better than the X5 or any other similarly shaped SUV. Recently took a road trip (1800 miles) and it was extremely comfortable. I usually swap out my cars every 1-2 years, but I do believe I will hold on to this one for quite a while longer."

car_1236,2016 x6,Haven't owned long enough to comment on reliability.
car_1237,"This ""Ain't"" Your Daddy's SUV!","If you want an SUV by one, if you want a sports car buy one. If you are stuck somewhere in between and want the best of both worlds, the X6 M sport is the SAV for you! The genesis of the crossover revolution, all others are imitations."
car_1238,This car over delivered,"We have owned (4) prior BMWs (1 325IS and (3) Z4s) the latest was a 2013 Z4.  Loved the roadsters but needed something more practical yet sporty.  The 2016 X6 was the ticket.  We looked closely at the X4 but it was an odd size and would no meet our needs.  The X6 has plenty of headroom, front and rear seats.  It rides exceptionally well and is incredibly smooth.  It is very agile for its size, trust me I know agile having (3) Z4s and this car is agile.  It moves well, has excellent, smooth acceleration when you need it and is a pleasure to drive.  We have the 35is motor and in my opinion is all you need.  We have been to the mountains with a load for two people and had no trouble so I wouldn't recommend the 8 cylinder and the extra fuel consumption that goes with it.  My wife was worried that she would miss her roadster and she has said now numerous times that she loves her X6, loves how it looks and drives.  The only gripe we have I that it is a little tricky to get in and out of since it does not have a upper handle but not a big problem and you get used to it.  Everything else about this car has been outstanding and far better than I thought it woud be.  Also,  we get constant comments on how nice of a car it is from neighbors, friends and strangers so that is fun.  We own the white X that does not have the M body but has the aluminum running boards.  Hope this is helpful for you if you are considering this vehicle."
car_1239,You have to live with it to really know...,"I'm a wagon guy. A utility guy. A lover of great handling, powerful cars. I spend my money on cars. To me the ultimate car for the money is a GTI, or maybe a truck if you want the ultimate in utility. But let's say you can afford to splurge on a luxury car... why would you get an X6? Well, first off I have a truck. And a sports car(911). And a wagon(BMW 530). But the wagon is getting older and it was time for a replacement. So naturally I got the X6M as the ultimate wagon. That was a little over a year ago and when it was time to get rid of my wife's third row SUV(Mercedes GL550) for something smaller she decided on... another X6! This time the six cylinder X35i. I was surprised. But this is a surprising vehicle. Don't believe what they say about its storage space, there is a ton, trust me. Like fill up two shopping carts at Costco and fold down the rear seats and watch the X6 swallow it all, space. Which brings me to the X5's cargo space. This is the same car as the X5, just without the tall rear, so in the x5 you really only gain the space above the cargo area where you would stack stuff, and then you can't see out the back window. If you have one vehicle that extra space in the x5 might be important, but if you have a truck or don't usually buy big items you won't miss it. As I said the X6 has a LOT of space in its own right. Also, don't believe what they say about the rear seat room. I'm 6ft. tall and there is three inches of room above my head, and a large amount of legroom. The back seat is actually much more comfortable than the X5's which feels a little like a bench. Now for the good stuff... The X6 is an incredibly fun vehicle to drive. I have a 911. I have an X6M. I know fun. The 35i is a potent engine with great throttle response and a sublime transmission. The suspension is firm, never harsh and entices you to drive this thing like a race car. The brakes are stout. The steering is not 911 or X6M great but it's pretty good and the really the only thing drive-wise they could improve in my opinion. The steering is too light but if you're not jumping out of a 911 or X6M or GTI or BRZ you might not realize that it's not perfect. Want to go off-road? I drove an X3 through the off-road course at the BMW plant in South Carolina and trust me you can do a lot with the x-series BMW's. I go to Moab. I drive Jeeps on their gnarly routes. The X6 won't do that but don't underestimate its abilities off-road, it is very impressive. And the interior, oh my the interior. Wow, wow, wow. Gorgeous. Quality. Comfort. Perfection. The exterior? Well I like it. I don't love it like the 911 exterior, or a Ferrari. But it is different and there is something about this car that makes you take notice. I think it's cool, if a bit quirky. As I said, you really have to live with this vehicle to realize how great it is. One pleasant surprise has been our MPG with the X6. We are averaging over 20MPG in mixed driving with lots of hills. Our old diesel Mercedes GL averaged 20 and we thought that was great. 20MPG for this sporty, gas vehicle is super impressive and I have heard of people getting over 30 MPG on the highway. So if you are looking for a versatile vehicle that drives fantastic and provides a lot of utility while being stylish and different check out the X6."
car_1240,My first X6!,"Have owned 3 X5's, a 5 series and a 3 series over the years and have always wanted an X6. When I saw the new design I had to have one. Ordered the dark olive directly from South Carolina. Only took 3 weeks to get it after ordered. Love everything about it! Now, if you have kids and you need more space for traveling etc. then this isn't for you. I drive the car primarily and my wife and I have already taken trips. It's the perfect fun vehicle for a middle aged empty nester like me."
car_1241,Amaizing in so many ways,"This car has exceeded all my expectations.  It's the 2017 Rex Terra world.  Most of my driving is highway and oh what fun it is.  Looks small from outside, especially from the rear, but inside you feel you are in a spacious car of the future.  The handling and comfort are most surprising for an electric car and even more surprising is the acceleration and control you have.  Some things about the car take a little time getting used to, such as the regenerative breaking.  But after a few days, it becomes so natural you soon realize this should be in all cars.  The back seats fit only two adults but in the two times in the eight months I have owned the car, I have had someone in the rear seats only twice and they were quite comfortable.  I'm glad I got the Rex which provides a generator to charge the batteries as you drive to go an additional 80 to 90 miles.  That's more than an hour of driving until you find a gas station.  I've only been to the gas station a few times.  Most drivers would not even need the Rex but it does help with the Range Anxiety.  The maintenance on this car is just about none.  I drive 80 miles to work and back each day.  I have enjoyed the quiet comfortable ride every day.  My average speed is 75 mph on the highway and I look forward to driving every day.  It's just so much fun..."
car_1242,After 1 yr living electric,"I've had my i3REX for about 1 yr and have driven about 10K miles in a combination of 400 mile weekend trips to 80 mile airport runs to endless soccer shuttles in the greater NYC area from PA, NJ, NY and CT.  The car was delivered factory perfect and has only had one recall and one software upgrade.  It delivers the same range as when it was new.What the car is: An incredibly fun, nimble, exhilarating, holy cow, I can't believe a car can be this fun to drive, I feel like I am 16, where can I go next car.  The drive train and ride are un-naturally smooth and quiet.  It's remarkable.  It's fun in a vintage English sports car way complete with very predicable 4 wheel drifts, blazing acceleration, wicked torque and grand prix ""one pedal"" driving.  The car effortlessly dives into turns with the regen breaking acting like a hand break to unlock the back wheels, only to instantly re-engage as you hit the accelerator (yes, that is what it is) to power out of the turns.  Anyone that drives this car as a hyper miler is missing one the best driving experiences imaginable.  The fun comes from a combination of super-car ratio of torque-to-weight and grossly inadequate tires.  The latter is so poor that you can have all this fun below 40mph instead of 80 in an M5 or Vette.  That's not a bad thing.What it is not - a highway car.  At speeds above 80 this car is a white knuckle death ride and will take every bit of your driving skills to keep control.  It's top speed is governed at 98 but it has a practical limit of about 75.  If you are a pre-dawn commuter accustomed to hitting triple digits with your fellow commuters, step away and find another car.  As example of how slow you need to drive this car, I historically have an avg driving speed of 44mph while in this car it's 33!.  I guess it could use some air dams to keep the air from floating the car  - maybe they could also help keep the car from getting airborne on mountain roads too.  Living electric - you have to want to.  This is an 90% car meaning it fills 90% of your car needs and am able to use it with some planning for almost everything except weekend trips with the family.   I use a level 1, 110v charger at home and it comfortably charges the car overnight (10K is about 25mile/day) on most days.  I only need to use public charges 2-3 times/month for the longer trips.  Using some ""extreme couponing"" type planning, I can string together 150 mile jaunts and have done 400miles in a weekend using only 1qt of gas.  It's possible because the range extending engine does its job to allow you to use the full batter capacity (I get about 80mile range in the summer and 60 mile in winter).  The REX however is in sharp contrast to the ultra refined electric drive in that it's  roughness, loudness and vibration is on par with your father's vintage tractor.  It works fine in city/suburban driving but the algorithms that control the battery reserves are not set for highway driving especially in the mountains.  A short hill quickly depletes the battery's reserve and you will find yourself seeking refuge from speeding cars behind a tandem trailer as you slow to 50mph to prevent an emergency shut-down.   Living with the car - The phone interface is incredibly disappointing and archaic.  The car rarely recognizes the phone when plugged in but still locks out most phone features (for obvious safety reasons) so you either have to do without or reinitiate the apps.   BMW's newest addition to the iDrive system is ""graffiti"" style input circa 1992 Palm Pilot.  The voice recognition is very poor and frustrating.  It could be due to a poor microphone or its placement.  There are however two redeeming features - you can bypass the car's labyrinth of commands and access Siri via a button on the steering wheel or use one of 8 programable buttons on the dash to get instant access to any car/phone function.  The sound system is a disappointment and certainly not on level with the car's price tag (I have the standard system).  Fortunately you don't spend a lot of time in this car but if you rely on your phone for music, navigation and calls, you will be disappointed.  I use it as an excuse to unplug connect to the kids and enjoy the drive.The car's navigation system is equally poor.  I used it only 3-4 times and stopped after it directed me the wrong way on a 1-way street.  On a separate occasion it dropped us in the middle of a cemetary instead of a soccer field.  The traffic feature side by side against Waze was inadequate and slow to offer alternate routes around traffic.  In summary, this is an incredibly great car that brings you back to a gone-by era of fun, quiet and solitude in a great modern design."
car_1243,It is a great car,"Most of our driving is around town and short trips less than about 120 miles round trip. It is perfect for this driving! We are ""empty nesters"" and it is perfect for 2 adults. It would be less practical hauling around kids everywhere, I think. I've never enjoyed driving a car as much as the i3. I also drive differently than previous cars. I'm much more at ease driving slowly (the speed limit), because I'm more aware of energy consumption than with my previous gas vehicles. It is relaxing and fun. In over 1200 miles, we've only used 0.8 gallons of gas, and that was just to test whether the range extender works (it did). If I have one complaint, it is the complicated navigation and entertainment system. It has taken some time and a lot of reading and phone calls to BMW to understand what I'm doing. It is better after a month of using it, but there is a steep learning curve."

car_1247,Zippy car,"Before buying this, be clear on the actual miles you drive in any given week and when/where you can charge. I really like my i3 but I drive very few miles in any given week (< 50). So I don't need to charge the car very often. There are chargers at my work but not in my apartment complex. If I have to charge at home, I need to use some chargers down the street (which is fine because they're free!) I've had it over a month now and have yet to use the range extender. However, I still find myself with slight anxiety about making sure the car is charged enough - I'm hoping this will dissipate with time. I'm not a fan of the coach doors in the back. If you are parked side to side with other vehicles and open the front door and coach door at the same time, you're sort of trapped in the triangle while trying to get things out of the back seat. The trunk is much smaller than my Honda Fit. It barely fit my large suitcase. But I knew all of these things before I purchased so I can't complain. The car has amazing acceleration - really impressive. It's also super quiet. Wish the AC was a bit stronger - it just doesn't blow very hard even at the highest setting (likely because AC drains the battery a lot)."
car_1248,So far a great choice!,"I was first hesitant to make the jump to electric before the next year or so, there are a few great car coming out. But since I have a VW TDI Passat being bought back, I needed a new car as a replacement. Unfortunately, there is not any other car I could find that would compare to the Passat for MPG and interior room. I test drove a BMW 5 series and was disappointed, I felt claustrophobic and just didn't seem right. So I decided to try the i3, boy was I surprised! It doesn't have the back seat room like my VW, but it's fun to drive, gets amazing fuel(kW) mileage, and seems to fit my life style just fine. I opted for the REx version and glad I did. I have made a few trips with my family(wife and two kids) no problem. Even a Costco run!"
car_1249,No Anxiety- Range Curiosity,"Our i3 has taken us over 21,000 miles- 98+% of it on battery- EV mode. The Range Extender eliminates the anxiety of those last miles before the charger. And, since we charge in our own garage, it is no problem to plug it in 5 or 6 times per week. This is not a road trip car. Buy it for around town comfort, fun and ease of driving. Nice to save CO2 every mile and get that EV smile while cruising in quiet BMW style. Most people think they need more range than they really do."
car_1250,Worth every penny.,I was hesitant on going full electric -- there is a lot of opinions and propaganda out there. I don't regret it at all.  This car is top notch quality and performance.
car_1251,Driving a spaceship,"This is my second i3, and the extra battery range is a game-changer.

car_1253,Bmw i3,It's Not for everybody. I feel I got more than a car I have technology
car_1254,My new M6,"I have to disagree with some of the reviews I have read about the M6-especially regarding the SMG. I think the car is involving, and the SMG takes a little bit of getting used to for smooth shifts, but I love the transmission. This car ain't for sissies and is very rewarding to drive if you like to remain involved. One doesn't really need a radio because the highly strung V10 is a symphony itself. Regarding the SMG-it should be set to manual around town, and to its quickest shifting setting and you may have to lift off the throttle for each shift a fraction of a second for seamless shifts. Big deal! Got my 2010 brand new for $79k and is a bargain supercar. Gas mileage bad but I knew b-4hand."
car_1255,Great car ruined by transmission flaws,"I wanted to love this car but the SMG transmission needs a re-work to fix the flaws in the engineering design. It has serious issues like others have said in terms of shifting and power in automatic mode. Also gas mileage is terrible- BMW needs to find a way to tweak 26-30 mpg from the V10 or make a turbo charged six cylinder engine with 500HP. Porsche did it, why not BMW? I think BMW needs to get help from Porsche and Nissan on how to make a decent transmission and improve gas mileage. Sad because I wanted to love the car as it excels in all other areas over the competition. Even the 650i has a better transmission and gas mileage."
car_1256,Almost perfect electric vehicle,"Fun too drive.  Supet quiet.  Zero emissions.  After this great experience with first electric car, I don't think I could go back to another internal combustion vehicle.  Electric range of  200+ miles and a 5th seat would make it perfect."
car_1257,Love the quiet,"It's been a great first month. The car has had no issues.  Acceleration is amazing and the quiet is just sublime.  Good sound insulation also protects the interior from external noise as well as the lack of engine noise.  We've had no problems; range is as advertised.  Installed a 220 v 40 amp charger in the garage that is very convenient.  Haven't had to use the Range extender yet, though my wife told me she got a notification that the engine was cycling, presumably just to keep the fluids from settling too much.  Enormous headroom; I'm 6'4 and have another 2"" beyond the top of my head.  Visibility is excellent.  The rear seats are quite usable but wouldn't buy it if we anticipated using them a lot.  Lots of trunk space.  Only gripe is that the BMW technology integration is a bit wonky and takes some getting used to.  Would have loved to have electric seats, but I suspect that would have added significant weight.  Carbon fiber body is really nice as is the interior wood.  Seats are very comfortable."
car_1258,Great update for 2017,"While I think some more tweaks are needed to set the car apart, overall this is a great car.  It's my second electric (previously had a Leaf) and the Bimmer is an exceptional commuter.  No range anxiety with this especially with the new battery.  I've driven over 100 miles and still had 37% percent battery charge left.  The new color option of protonic blue is a great step forward.  Pick-up 0 to 30 is outstanding though you will feel the road and bumps a little much.  Previous reviews on ride comfort hold true for the battery refreshed 2017.  Overall a great car for suburbanites and urban dwellers.  Getting 5 miles per kW hour."
car_1259,Fun to drive but controls not intuitive,"Beautiful Car and GREAT to drive.  I ended up picking this mainly because I wanted a hard-top convertible with some power.  This car drives great, is comfortable, and great with the top down.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase but am a little annoyed by some things that don't make sense to me, a lot related to difficult function controls.  I've only had it about a month so part of this might be just adjusting to BMW ways.  First of all, it isn't possible to put this car into PARK without turning off the car.  So weird and annoying if you want to be SURE that it is in PARK.  It switches to park automatically if turning off the car in Drive or Reverse, but otherwise you can only put it into NEUTRAL and set the parking brake if you want to sit idle, or turn it off and turn it back on.  Also, the lack of touch for the screen interface is inefficient for entering addresses, and the finger spelling on the console control knob is not a good replacement--much easier to tap out a number on a screen than trace each individual number/letter.  Also, the volume control is only on the dash or on the right side of the steering wheel--this means if you have your hand on the console knob controlling your nav/media, driving with your left hand, you have to move your right hand from the console knob to the dash or the steering wheel.  The car has options for comfort suspension for daily driving but there isn't a way to make that a default--it always goes back to the more rigid SPORT option so that you have to reselect each time you start the car for COMFORT.  There are other little things like the toggle for the hard-top requires you to pull BACK to put the top UP/Forward, and push Forward to put the top down/back -- just not intuitive.  LOTS of media options but difficult to sort out.  Anyway, I'll stop with these things since overall it's a very nice car with AMAZING driving profile, which is what most people might be looking for and the little things might not matter.  It's my primary car so the daily use things are a little annoying to me.  As far as hard-topped convertible with power, I think this is the only good choice.  I was considering going Mercedes C63 Coupe but didn't test-drive it since I still wanted the convertible."
car_1260,M4 the great,M4 the great
car_1261,Mediocre ride,"I have been driving this car for over a month. It’s a loaner from the dealership. While the handling is very good, comfort is pretty bad and the vehicle is really noisy. The engine is adequate for this size and the car looks great. Also my phone is often not recognized and I can’t control it from the entertainment system. GPS is good. The dar is full of little noises and road noise is incredibly loud."
car_1262,X1 Beamer,"The reason I only gave 4 stars and not 5 is purely due to the fact we've only had the car 3 weeks. I test drove and researched similiar models for over a month and it came down to the X1 and Q3 Audi. In the end, the dealership made us a fantastic offer, and were just more attentive to us as the customer. The X1 just felt better behind the wheel (side not - we own an Audi) and the little extra HP in the X1helps with these 4 -cyl engines."
car_1263,Love the x1,"Great visibility , handling , breaking , comfort , small and easy to drive ! Difficult criteria to find all in one vehicle , I found it in the X1.A year later , still LOVE my x1, not a fan of the run flat tires you need to change them all if something happens to one tire, thankfully they were able to do a repair on one tire for $80 . The fold down seats are a great and very useful feature!"
car_1264,Exactly what I was looking for,"My commute used to be 4 miles, so I bought a cute little Mercedes coupe.  Then my commute changed and was taking 2 busy highways for 45 minutes.  I felt very insecure in my little car.  I really like driving a car, so although I wanted a higher vehicle, I didn't look forward to the parking issues of having a bigger vehicle.  Then I came across the X1.  It is actually 6"" shorter than my coupe was and not much wider.  However, it has the height I wanted, and great interior and cargo space!  Just blown away!  When I test drove it, I immediately felt comfortable with the location of all the controls.  I am only 5'4"" and everything is easily reached.  I've always really liked the controls to be in the gear shift area and using a dial.  Someone commented it isn't safe to look down.  You aren't supposed to look at it at all.  That is the point of it being down there, so you can adjust things by touch instead of by sight.  You just need to learn where the buttons are and how to use the dial effectively.  The visibility is great and since I don't have any depth perception, I LOVE the parking help.  Now I can go around tight spaces without worrying about hitting something.  There are 2 negatives only, the rear window is small and blocked by the rear center head rest.  I'll just fold down the center to improve viewing.  Also, the seat is very firm.  I'll have to bring a seat pad for long trips.  For a daily driver with lots of stop and go traffic, I am ecstatic.  It is great looking and fun to drive.  ***update after driving for a month.  The seat has softened from use, so now it is quite comfortable."
car_1265,WOW!! What a car!!,"I am a TDI victim and found this gem at the local dealer. Its the greatest car I've ever owned. Its the perfect size, not to big, but big enough. The creature comforts are unbelievable. The handling, acceleration and seats are all fantastic. The other car companies must pay people to write bad reviews. Please at least go and test drive one and you will be amazed. The lighting at night is really neat. Also, BMW rebuilds their cars on the inside, not some new plastic molding like other car companies. Get it! Enjoy it! I just wanted to let people know. I've never written a review before... yeah I like it that much."
car_1266,Best small SUV currently available,"Every car is a series of compromises.  In the areas that are priorities to me - safety, quality, performance - the X1 scores well.  Its chief limitations are modest cargo capacity and a somewhat cramped (for adults at least) rear seat.  However, given that the X1 has a footprint barely bigger than a Prius, it is roomy by the standards of small vehicles.  If you need substantial cargo capacity you should look at the X3 or X5.  If you need to seat adults in the rear seats on a regular basis look at the X3 or ensure that you get an X1 with the sliding/reclining rear seat option.  But for my family only small children sit in the back, and the standard X1 is just about ideal.  We have a second car which is a good deal larger than the X1.  Parking tends to be difficult where we live, and it is significantly easier to find a parking place for the X1 than it is to find a parking place for the larger vehicle.  Fuel economy is noteworthy, I did not believe the stated 32mpg on the highway was really achievable, but we took a road trip with the X1 and I can report that figure is absolutely attainable.  Overall great small SUV."
car_1267,My first BMW - wont be my last!!,I have owned or leased MANY cars in my life..This is my first BMW and I just love it...What a great little SAV....
car_1268,A real nice SUV,This car handles and rides effortlessly. Great interior finish and instrumentation.
car_1269,Significant improvement from the prev. generation!,"I had a 2014 X1 (prev generation) that was my favorite car ever, but was coming off lease. I expected this new generation of X1 to be fair since it was being molded to look like the rest of the X-line family (truth be told, I wanted the Tesla Model 3 but couldn't wait that long). I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is actually more fun than the last one. Slightly less horsepower, yet the 0-60 is quicker. The move to a front-wheel-emphasized 4WD is not noticeable. I sometimes miss the hydraulic steering (however, the 2016's adaptive steering makes parking and city driving much easier). I got every tech package except the ACC (c'mon, an extra thousand, really?) and it seems worth it. By adding a few extra PSI to the tires (compared to the door sticker), I am getting 35+ MPG on the highway! Eco-mode is much more useful now without sacrifice (I especially didn't like the jolt on the 2014 when I needed to pass someone on the highway due to the shift timing change in this mode). The interior materials are a step up (interior lighting at night is especially top notch). The rear view is crowded compared to previous gen (due to smaller rear window and seat back obstructions), but not dangerous. The front seats are narrower than the last model and could use a little more cushioning as well - make sure you like them first vs. ordering the sports seats/package. I am 5'8 at 175 pounds so the base seats work for me. Overall, It's more luxurious, quieter and more fun than the previous generation (which was already great). I will have a hard time giving this up in 3 years."

car_1271,New and improved for 2016,The 2016 is roomier and drives much smoother than my previous 2013. The seats are more comfortable as well. Love the updates!

car_1273,Long time BMW owner,"I've had a 328, 528, and now a X1.  I have the MSport pack (Estoril Blue), Tech, Cold Weather, and Driver Asst packages.   The SAV (as Munich likes to call it) is/has everything I need in a car.  Most importantly, I don't have to fold down the seats to put two golf bags in the back.  My favorite attributes about BMW is the familiarity with the iDrive system and it's the only manufacturer in this segment where the passenger can enter an address into the Nav while the car is in drive.  I test drove Lexus/Audi and both required the car to be in park in order to enter an address into the nav (unless I wanted to use the voice recognition - which is always terrible)!  Anyway, this car is typical BMW - high end interior parts and all of the controls are where they should be.  Now I do have ONE gripe - the temperature controls only move in two degree increments and in even numbers only.  I contacted BMW about this and it's because the car is based off the MINI Countryman.  Let's not forget, this is an entry level BMW, so it's not the biggest deal for me.  Overall, I'm glad I got this SAV."

car_1275,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","Let me preface by saying my last three cars were Hondas. I wanted an upgrade with more pep and more luxury. So here goes - The Good: Acceleration - Amazing, Interior Space - Amazing (overall same length as my Honda Civic but the interior feels MASSIVE), the Technology package with bluetooth, handsfree phone etc. - Great, the Steering - Fantastic. OK The Bad - After two weeks the tow-hook cover in the front fell off, never to be seen again. Rear Visibility: Not great. Parking Assist - I live in LA and you really have to hurry your parking cause there's always someone behind you. The parking assist is either slow in figuring out there's a spot or it never figures it out. Pointless. Fuel Consumption - Not Great At All, I have it on Eco Mode most of the time and my average after 4000 miles with about 1000 highway no traffic driving is 22.3 mpg. The Ugly: The seats are TERRIBLE. The Ride is also TERRIBLE probably due to the runflat tires and maybe the suspension. I started researching how to replace the seats and the tires. Yes, it's that bad."

car_1277,The worst seats imaginable,"The good: it's faster than other similarly sized small suv's and has good bmw looksThe bad: these are the worst seats. my test drive seemed ok but once you sit in them for a while you know. it's like sitting on a flat park bench.  sport seats are only available in the m package, which dealers here don't order"
car_1278,x! REVIEW,BUY PRICE SHOULD BE FOR INVOICE
car_1279,"My wife is now officially a ""car girl""","I've always been a fan of BMW's, but this is the first one I've actually owned.  My wife and I test drove this and the X3 and quickly realized the fresh look of the new X1 and increased sized put in on par with the X3 from a space perspective.  I'm 6'4"" 235lbs and can fit comfortably in any of the seats even with the front seat in the rearmost position.  It's been comfortable on several interstate trips and we love the zippy handling and performance around town.  We have also been impressed with the fuel mileage considering the sportiness this car offers.  Before we bought the BMW, I was the ""car guy"" in the family and my wife didn't really get too excited talking about cars.  Now that she's has her BMW she says she's never buying anything else and is very particular about keeping it clean inside and out while making sure she can find that perfect parking spot.  She's officially a ""car girl"" now! :-)"
car_1280,It's a little/BIG SUV/SAV,"I was cross shopping the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, BMW X3, and Volkswagen GTI. And then I saw this new X1. I was thinking to wait for the next gen Q5, but I decided to buy this car. It’s a handsome car inside out. The interior is very spacious. The headroom and legroom are comparable or even bigger than the current Q5, GLC, X3, and GTI. It’s even comparable to the larger X5. (X5 vs X1: F head 40, 41.9; R head 39.3, 39.4; F leg 40, 40.4; R leg 36.6, 37) I am 5’10, 165 lbs, I fit in the back seat comfortably even when the front seat is all the way back. And my car is not even with the sliding rear seat option. The trunk is also big, fits $200+ groceries from Costco easily. The engine is potent. The transmission is smooth. The handle is nimble. The acceleration is quick. It’s fuel efficient. Overall it’s a very practical car. I understand it’s being categorized as a subcompact SUV/SAV, but you really have to test drive and get inside of the car to understand what I’m talking about. It’s BIG!!! OK, now the bad. The front seat is too narrow. The gas pedal is too close to the side wall of the center console. The center console storage is relatively small. There is still noticeable turbo lag when stop and go. The suspension is too hard, you can feel every tinny hole and bump on the road. The LED headlight and taillight only come with the premium package, and the price is pretty premium for that."
car_1281,Great mult-purpose vehicle,"I looked at the Mercedes GLA, Audi Q3, and BMW X1.  The 2016 BMX X1 was by far the best.  A very practical vehicle, with excellent cargo and passenger room for a compact SUV.  Excellent performance and gas mileage from the 4 cyl turbo engine.  BMW handling and overall driving experience  is an added bonus.  I have owned two BMW 3 series sedans.  The handling is not as good a these, but the handling is better than any other compact SUV I have driven. The most value for the money compared to other luxury compact SUVs."
car_1282,Wouldn't Get Another One,"Got stuck in a lease with one of these, I immediately regretted it. BMW must be paying for positive reviews, because it' not that stellar of a vehicle. The car has stylish looks, has many bells and whistles, and is fun to drive in Sport mode, but that's about it - everything else is like driving a typical 4-cylinder, kind of boring and sluggish. The worst part about the X1 is the interior comfort and design. The front seats are the worst I've ever seen, they have ZERO padding, way too firm like sitting on a park bench, they're also too narrow and high. The leather is very grippy and not smooth, tugs your shirt. The steering wheel obstructs the dashboard, you can't get a clear view of the entire instrumentation through the top hole of the steering wheel. The controls for the screen and navigation are horrible and feel 20 years old. Selecting single letters or digits to input an address into the nav? Forget it. It's also unsafe having to look down at the control wheel and buttons instead of up. I would not describe the whole system as intuitive at all. Outside temp only visible to the driver, no digital speedometer, annoying. The on-wheel radio controls are not the easiest to set up or navigate. The whole cabin instrumentation is just overcomplicated, and kind of Frankensteined with new and old. The screen looks like it should descend, but it doesn't, it's kind of unsightly like it's tacked on. MPG is so-so unless you drive in Eco mode which turns engine off at stops. Overall very disappointed with the X1. It looks like a BMW on the outside, but it isn't on the inside."
car_1283,"Nice car, but dealership service dept is worthless","I purchased my X1 new off the showroom floor and when leaving found a ding on the dash and a light was missing in the door.   I was told my BMW had navigation that talks, but it didn't.  I was told it had blind spot monitoring, but it didn't, this car has a serious blind spot.  The dealer wrote a ""We Owe"" to fix the dash.  Trying to get BMW to do anything is like pulling teeth.  2 months later ding is still there and no light.  Their response is, it's coming from Germany and we have to get approval.  Just make sure your X1 is in perfect condition when you leave, because it will never get fixed.  Sad to say this will be my last BMW because of the service I've received.  UPDATE:  Finally after contacting Better Business Bureau, Fields BMW replaced the dash and the light in the door.  It was also missing the front grill cover and they replaced it too.  This was a nightmare getting it done and I had to contact: BBB, BMW and every social media available.  It took me over 100 phone calls, most of which didn't get returned, to get the car in new condition.  After dash was replaced I traded it for a new Lexus ES350 that I love; mainly because I hated Fields BMW and didn't want to return and they own both BMW dealerships near me."
car_1284,Zippy new BMW X1,"Sporty, fun to drive X1. Roomy ""trunk"" area."
car_1285,"Great value, and ROOMY! Beautiful vehicle!","This is the new ""Handsome car"" I tell my mother. She just purchased this vehicle and took the title of ""handsome car"" from my father's Mercedes. I don't even really know what to say about this car. Everything is perfect, and when I drove it the thing felt sportier than my RSX-S. Quicker too!"
car_1286,Terrific car!,"We had 3 2-seater cars and wanted something small but classy.  After looking at several, saw this one and fell in love.  It is everything that comes with the BMW name - great ride, wonderful exceleration, and just a pleasure to drive.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but worth every penny.  Since we already own 2 other BMW's, we were aware that the maintenance cost would be at the high end.  But we'll still be driving this car when all the others are razor blades!"
car_1287,Xceptional!,"3500 miles in and 5 stars in all aspects.  Based on my experience, it lives up to BMW's billing...best in class performance, fuel economy and cargo.  I evaluated other comparable models (Lexus NX, Acura RDX, Mercedes GLA, and Audi Q3) and chose the BMW X1.  Car and Driver rating 4.5 out of 5.It's roomier on the inside than it appears from the outside.  For both rows of seats, it actually has more head and leg room than the current BMW X3.  I highly recommend the optional sliding 2nd row seat to gain flexibility for passengers versus cargo.Well-engineered and easy to use information technology (iDrive, bluetooth, Navigation, etc.).  I didn't spec the safety technologies, so I can't comment on them.Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!"
car_1288,Just not a good value,"Ok small SUV, but noisy on the freeway,  some cheap bits in the interior and harsh ride. Dealers are not willing to move of MSRP much and it's just not worth the purchase price. Poor value for the money."
car_1289,"Great car, options expensive","Great car, options expensive"
car_1290,carish suv,"Roomy, comfortable, well appointed, and fun to drive.  If you're looking for a small suv, X1 could fit the bill."
car_1291,At Last my love has come along!!,"I traded in a 320  2013, I absolutely loved my car! but it was time up for lease. So I decided to buy the x1..... great choice. love this suv!! looks awesome. drives awesome. love the wheels. Love everything about it. gas mileage is as great as my 320. and I can tell you I didn't know what a gas pump looked like!! I was never at one the gas was so good. they changed the x1 this year and made an awesome SUV would highly recommend  this car."
car_1292,"So far, so good","I'm a new owner (bought a month ago), and have been pleased with the car so far in 1800 miles of driving. Admittedly, my previous car was a Scion, so any car in this range would have been a big step up. But I really enjoy the performance of the X1 - lots of extra power so that I can pass on the highway going uphill (I drive to Tahoe regularly). The traction works well in the snow so far. And it gets surprisingly good fuel efficiency - I mostly drive on the highway, and get 29-30 mpg on average. And I love the parking sensors - the rear-view camera, and the sonar to know when I'm getting close to obstacles while parking, are essential for parking in close quarters. The lumbar support is key as well on the long drives that I do. The controls (turn signals, windshield wipers, etc) are a bit funky and different than most cars so they take some time to learn, but I like the console control for the screen. And the Bluetooth integration with my phone works great for both playing audio and taking phone calls. So far, so good!"
car_1293,We love our 2016 BMW X1 / Chestnut Bronze Metallic,"This is our first BMW, but after a test drive and seeing all the features, we were sold. It drives great, tight and solid, everything in the car seems high quality. Our dealer spent hours explaining the long list of features and options. Our dealer made it a great buying experience.The CAR DETAILS below are wrong but I can't edit them. It's too soon to know it's reliability, but I expect it will be great. Our zip code is 36784, south west Alabama."
car_1294,"After a year, love it even more!",I had an older series 328.   I decided to make the break and trade it in on the X1.   I am so glad I did!  I love the car!  Fun to drive and handles like the  sporty car!
car_1295,"So many annoying things.. BMW, when will you learn","I am driving the 2015 model. The more I drive it the less I like it. As many professional reviewers have noted, the engine sounds really unpleasant. The shifter can be infuriating esp. changing between forward and reverse is very slow and requires the driver to engage the brake pedal for a significant amount of time. The navigation system is laughable (in the age of Google Maps). Sometimes I still use it but don't put your car in reverse after you entered your destination. The backup camera will come on and wipe out your destination entry. As for the backup camera: horrible contrast and low light performance (where does BMW even buy such low quality components). One of the most annoying things is that you cannot lock the car when you park it in Neutral (hard to believe but true). You have to turn the engine back on and put it in Drive, then get back out and lock it. If you leave it in Neutral it will sit unlocked, completely drain its battery and go dead in a matter of hours."
car_1296,"After 1 year, still love the M4","First, the performance of the car is best experienced on a track.  I've taken my M4 to a few tracks in the area, and it is unbelievable how well it performs.  I have the DCT transmission, and I know most enthusiasts would frown upon that (eg not a manual gearbox), but it's amazing what the DCT does and how it performs especially on the track.  I doubt you can truly appreciate it on normal streets.   No mechanical issues or problems with the car after the first year.    Only performed the regularly scheduled maintenance.  No interior issues (eg things breaking like handles/knobs).  I did get a ""wandering eye"" as I was curious about the MB C63 AMG and Alfa Romeo Giulia.  I struggle with reliability of MB and still waiting to hear more on the Giulia.  The only thing that bothers me, a little, is that I wish the M4 had a better exhaust note.   I will say that the one best piece advice I had heard was this: ""if you don't plan to take the M4 to the track, consider purchasing the 4 series."""
car_1297,A Year Later And I Still Love My 2015 M4,"I absolutely love this car.   I used the European delivery program and picked up the car at the BMW Welt in Munich.  It was truly wonderful experience followed by a superb road trip in the Swiss and French Alps.    I only ordered three options with the car:  full leather seats, Silverstone metallic paint and the premium H&K sound system.   I also highly recommend the 6 speed manual transmission.  Quite frankly, for the price I paid this is the best car I've ever owned."
car_1298,OH MAN,"This car is a beast!!! The car flat out flies and will get you into trouble if you don't watch your foot. The interior is ok, it is not the real leather that you would expect from a  80,000 dollar car. My 09 z4 has beautiful real leather seats and wood trim that to this day is beautiful and so nice."
car_1299,Awesome M4,"I was initially looking at the Audi RS5 and S7 as well as the new Corvette and decided on the BMW M4. I was impressed with the exterior styling with a very aggressive front and rear. I get a few compliments on my M4 each week. Next, the power and torque are off the charts. This car is scary fast and handles extremely good. The iDrive is very easy to use and the technology in the M4 is like that of a more expensive car. The seats are very comfortable and good for people like myself who have back issues. The braking is incredible and opted for the standard brakes. I got every option offered on the M4 except for the ceramic brakes."
car_1300,"2015 M4 Coupe...Oh, my...","I previously owned a 2009 M3 and got rid of it after only a month.  I never understood why all the excitement about the V-8.  Sure, it had plenty of top end, but there was literally no torque.  It was anything but fun to drive and I grew tired of being blown off the line by EVOs and Mopars.  Now, this new M4 is a completely different beast.  It's a ROCKET and has beautiful, aggresive styling.  I absolutely LOVE driving this thing.  It's mid range torque is other-worldly.  I would compare it to the feeling of driving a 911 Turbo. Having owned Porsches, Ferrari's, AMGs, I think this is the best performance car you can buy under $100K."

car_1302,It *IS* my everyday car,"This is my everyday car, except for my wife's minivan which I don't really drive.I love love love this car.I bought it used a year and a half ago and it has never ceased to amaze me every time I get behind the wheel.I don't mind the smg.I just shift it how I want anyway and go back and forth between auto and manual.I played around with the shift points until I just finally left it on default.I love being able to just BE where I want to be in traffic without thinking.BMW was faithful to the spirit of man when they built this car."
car_1303,"A track car, not for every day use","Speed, engine sound, interior, exterior - awesome! That's why I bought it.. But SMG... Yes, you can adopt, learn how to drive it smoothly. But if you have to ""adopt"" every time you drive it - it becomes a pain. Took it on the track - INCREDIBLE power, handling in M mode, everything. But driving it every day - SMG kills it all. Hopefully they will put a new ""double clutch"" on it I have on my Z4 now. That would make this car an absolute dream!"
car_1304,THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE M6,"My M6 developed a thirst for oil at just 1,800 kilometres and used an average of 1 litre of oil per 1,000 kilometres until BMW agreed to replace the engine.  A combination of having to stop every 1,000 kilometres to top up the oil and a faulty tyre pressure indicator made BMW's fastest convertible actually slower on trips than my daughter's Smart ForTwo.  Add to this the fact that BMW Australia apparently don't stock parts and the fact that you can't buy tyres for them and you've got a car that reminds me of the old Jaguar joke that you need to buy 2 of them so you'll always have 1 to drive while the other one is in being fixed."
car_1305,BMW M6 Coupe,"I ordered this vehicle new in 2007. The car is everything I expected. My M6 averages 24.4 mpg highway at 80 mph. Much better the the 4.4 X5 Sport that gets 18.4 highway. The M6 has the styling, power and performance that is advertised. I would recommend the vehicle."
car_1306,What an AWESOME car!!,"I purchased my 2007 BMW M6 Convertible about 10 months ago. I decided to hold off on submitting my review until now because I like to form a close relationship with my vehicle before singing its accolades. Well, all I can say is that this car has exceeded all my expectations. It is simply the best car I have ever owned, bar none. The car is an absolute blast to drive. For the first time, I actually look forward to getting up in the morning to drive the 20 miles to my office. Same applies to my drive home from work. The V10 engine is sublime. The handling is confidence-inspiring. The build quality is second to none. As far as the iDrive and SMG are concerned, I love them both."
car_1307,2007 BMW M6,This car incredibly fun to drive and the handling is second to none.
car_1308,"M6 has looks, style, speed, comfort","Yes I ordered and waited for my M6 coupe to arrive. After the 1200 mile break-in to get the additional 100HP the fun begins. Launch control is awesome! Yes, I said launch control. Your BMW dealership generally does not tell you about this hidden feature that launches you from a stop right into the future. You can experience all 505HP and accelerate from 0-60 in no time. Quite the rush! The M6 gets respect on the highway and all the looks in the city. Another great vehicle from the BMW family."
car_1309,My White 2006 M6 Coupe,"I traded up from a Yellow M3.  Everyone had to look at that car whether it was in awe or disgust.  However, until I got my M6, never has a member of the opposite sex flirted with me from their car.  It has happened 5 times since July 15th.  This car turns heads who see it.  Moreover it turns heads of people who hear it going by.  The acceleration over 90 MPH is insane, and it feels like 0-100 mph is only 6.2.  Would prefer if it had more distinctive flare like my M3.  It does not even have a raised hood.  When you sit down in it and turn it on, and it rumbles into place, there is not much better a feeling to a driving person on Earth.  If you are looking at Porsche turbo, drive this car too!"
car_1310,Fun Fun Car to drive,Awesome power! Great stability in turns at high speed. Nice base package with most of the toys included.  Fun car with the top up or down.
car_1311,BMW M6 Convertible,"This car is an amazing engineering feat.  It is meant to be driven hard, not tamely. The entire vehicle responds well when pushed hard. Of course it is the ultimate eye catcher. So enjoy."
car_1312,Superb Alll Rounder,"Great GT because it can do 95% of what a pure sports car can do on a track. On the road no sports car will leave the M6 behind. Furthermore it is very comfortable, well made and huge fun. iDrive is easy, and SMG faultless. What is the problem with all you testers. If you need help in learning how to drive SMG smoothly let me know. I'll gladly show you!"
car_1313,Great but Picked On Car.,"The fact that this car is so hotly debated in most forums suggests that it's controversial. There are many people who love it and hate it.  It's fast, fun to drive, and comfortable. And is very innovative in creature comforts, build quality, engineering, and performance.  Some might complain that the car is too heavy or has a bad transmission, my advice is if you don't like it don't buy it. For those who do love this car, shop around... and if you buy one it'll deliver a great (but possibly the ultimate) driving experience time and time again and will turns heads wherever you go."
car_1314,BMW M6 is FUN!,"I've had many Bimmers, but the M6 is absolutely incredible. You can't drive it without a smile on your face!!!  Great power, more than I can ever possibly put to use... not that it isn't fun to get on it! Yet it feels very solid. I was going to go porsche turbo, but the M6 is much less jumpy and it's more comfortable. And I didn't buy it to race, so I like the extra room. If you like BMW, you're gonna love this car!!"
car_1315,Thrilled,"My new M6 replaces a 911 C4S and a BMW X5 - and superbly blends the two with speed, firmness of drive and wonderful comfort. Compliments for its looks are only surpassed by those for its growl. Shifting takes a few days to master smoothly (even in automatic) - the optional M-mode significantly adds HP and despite the luxurious drive, handling rivals the 911 (almost). The heads up display and paddle shifters in M-mode is cooler than my cousin's F430 - and easier to drive. The sport seats are the most comfortable I've experienced. HD sound playing from Satellite or FM is fantastic and the voice command audio makes getting the music right easy while paying attention to the road. Great ride - A+."
car_1316,Spaceship @ Warpspeed,"This car craves the autobahn. I am consistently going 10 to 20 mph over the speed limit w/o meaning to. The car seems to idle @ 70 mph. Great power, I would like to change the rear end to a Dinan3.91 for better low end speed. I love this car. Gas mileage as one would expect is horrible, but that goes with the 500 hp territory."
car_1317,BMW M6 Convertible,"I was excited when my dealer told me a new black M6 convertible was in stock so I rushed out to get this baby. About a month of ownership later, I am so disappointed with this car that I may burn my BMW fan club card. I'm close to swearing off BMWs and giving Mercedes or Lexus a try.  I loved BMWs in the first place due to their engineering, reliability, style, and service. So far, the M6C's engineering is questionable, reliability pitiful, style passable, and though the BMW service is superb, it has nothing to do with the physical car itself! My new M6C has been in the shop 4x in the last month and needless to say, it's the most unreliable BMW I've ever purchased; and I've owned 6 so far."
car_1318,BMW M4 CONV,"I bought this car with 5 miles on the odometer so I might have been the 1st person to take a  test drive. This was a little surprising as the car was on the lot for about 6 weeks. The new 2018s were being delivered starting April 1 and I got my car on April 7 with a huge discount. It runs perfectly, has great comfort, power, handling and overall smoothness you would expect in a car listed at $90k. Most surprisingly is the good gas mileage around 21.5 mixed driving on premium gas.The top works flawlessly...  with the provided rear wind screen when the top is down you do not have any in car turbulence. You can talk in a normal voice and listen to the radio w/o any extra volume (although it adjusts to your speed). Surprisingly the windscreen does away with any wind in the front 2 seats but does take away the back seat. The trunk as  a unique loading system but if you are taking any long trips it can only hold 1 suitcase."
car_1319,One sweet M4 convertible,"I have had my 2016 M4 convertible (with competition package) since the middle of May (it is now the end of August). I have 5000 miles on it now. It is a FANTASTIC car. It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 & 1 to Santa Monica  that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!!  For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation.  I've lowered the car 3/4"" front and back. Put Niche rims on and went to 305's on the back from the stock 285's. It is one....... Sweet.........car. My 2 business partners have opted for coupes. One got his this week. The other is headed to Munich next week to enjoy a European delivery. He will drive his around Europe for a couple weeks then BMW will ship it home.  We each have our own specific tastes in the car. BMW offers a wide range of color combinations. If you can afford the car, you will not be disappointed"
car_1320,M4,M4
car_1321,Batmobile on steroids,"It is the perfect car.   It is civil in everyday traffic, but is a lot of fun whenever you need (or want) to accelerate or shame a Mustang owner.   The Launch Control function is so fast, it is scary.    Anyone who complains about the instrumentation being too complicated should go back to the dealership and get a five- to 10-minute primer on the iDrive, etc., from a BMW ""Genius.""  I have wanted an M3 for years, and finally made the plunge.  I opted for the M4 coupe, and it has not disappointed."
car_1322,Not user friendly,The door handles have to be pulled twice to get in or out of the car. The door unlock is in the center of the dash. It's inconvenient. The automatic transmission is difficult to get into park. Difficult for anew driver to get into drive. It's very easy to turn on the paddle shifters when putting into drive. My wife refuses to drive it anymore. The garage door opener was impossible to set. I gave up. I have set it for years on American cars. The electronics or command in center console not user friendly. I would never buy another BMW or German car. American cars are much more user friendly.
car_1323,"Great car, my 2nd M","I'm loving my daily driver M4 convertible.  It's a sport convertible, with limited space.  Don't expect to put 4 large luggages, it's not made for that.  But it has reasonable space for a hardtop that goes in the trunk.  I also wanted a 4 seater and the seats seem to have more space than my E46 M3 convertible.Overall, great car, but you do pay for it.  I would buy it again."
car_1324,Don't buy this POS,I'm currently in the worst battle waiting for BMW to buy this car back. It was in the shop for over six months. BMW North America is a nightmare they will do nothing to help you they are worthless. Do not buy this car it's terrible
car_1325,I am an i3 believer!,"I was looking for a stylish EV that was fun to drive, reliable, and had looks I appreciated.  I had read numerous reviews on the i3, had seem them on the streets, and had more than once concluded it was not the car for me.  However, when we had arrived at the BMW dealership to test-drive a 2014 3-series diesel wagon (I was getting desperate), there was my car for sale, beckoning my wife and I.  Now, my wife knew my checklist, and after asking our questions and taking it for a test drive, she was convinced this was my car.  I had my reservations, as I commute around 30 miles to work, and am usually driving an additional 30-50 miles for business meetings each day.  Given that this car is rear-wheel drive with no AWD, I had concerns about the snow.  Additionally, the list price of the car was a lot higher than Edmunds' TMV and Cars.com's average recent sold price for these vehicles.  Lastly, the i Remote app for this car had just horrible reviews.  On the positive side, my car had just over 19k miles, includes the Giga and technology packages, was certified pre-owned, and in fantastic condition with no visible wear and tear.  All told, we negotiated a final price of $28k with brand new snow tires (including wheels), a BMW home charging station (not including installation), 0.9% APR (due to us first visiting on President's Day Weekend), and a $1500 trade-in.  Now here we are about 2 months later, with having driven over 3k miles in snow, rain, freezing cold and 90+ degree heat.  I LOVE this car.  Now, I do drive very conservatively, making full use of the one-pedal driving (which had a quick learning curve) and never going above 68 mph on the highway.  I do a mix of highway with twisty backroads.  However, with all the mileage I drive, I hardly ever use the range extender.  The most I have driven on a full charge is around 82 miles.  Most of my meetings are in Boston, and I can usually find a garage with an available charging station.  When I have had to fill up on gas (that sounds so odd to type), it was always a 2-second fill, staying under $3 per fill!  This car feels incredibly solid to drive (like you're in a tank, it just feels so heavy), yet is very nimble.  The steering is precise and tight.  Handling on the curves is fun, but the car feels unstable if you really push it.  Surprisingly, without the snow tires, it handles pretty well on snow-covered roads - it even got me out of my uphill driveway without any slippage.  You just feel more connected to the road with the i3.  Being that it is a light car, and somewhat tall, it can easily be affected by strong winds on the highway.  Yes, this is an odd looking car.  In my opinion, it looks best from any profile view, and just plain odd from a direct front or back view.  The inside is beautifully designed, spacious, and posh.  For utility, the overall storage space is not much, but I am able to make my transfer station trips with a full-size plastic garbage can and several square container bins of recycling.  As for the i Remote app, it has had its share of bugs, but otherwise works like a charm (I even gave it a glowing review in the App Store).  I cannot recommend this car enough - once you get behind the wheel and drive it, you will be won over."
car_1326,I LOVE MY USED (NEW-TO-ME) BMW i3!,"I own a delivery service and drive about 90+ miles per day. My hybrid was costing me $600/mo to own & operate (required maintenance but I knew I would never be stranded by a dead battery. I've been wanting an electric car for a few years now but the range of the EVs that I CAN AFFORD has been too low to take the risk of being stranded. So I discover the 2017 BMW i3...I only discovered the i3 a few months ago and upon reading the configuration of the i3 w/Range Extender, realized that it is perfect for the driving I do. It is always in EV mode and if I use up all of the juice, the generator comes on and keeps me going. BUT I couldn't justify the price tag of the new 2017...it would cost me more to own & operate the i3 over my Honda which would negate all financial benefits of going electric. SOOOO...I started searching for older i3s and found that the oldest ones are 2014. The cheapest one I found was listed at a used car lot 170 miles away. I bought it for $15,900 w/62,212 miles and it was a dealer buyback on the lemon law. I've owned it 6 weeks now and it's been a total dream car! I'm saving $200/mo to own & operate the BMW i3 over the Honda hybrid. I've had more comments on this car than any car I've ever owned my whole life. I'M ATTEMPTING TO BUY A FLEET OF THESE FOR MY EMPLOYEES!"
car_1327,"Some awesome things, some not so good.","The electric I3 is at heart a great BMW car. It is fun to drive, roomy, handles well, and is quite stylish. The range is ok as long as you have a second gas powered car for trips because you're not taking this one anywhere out of town. The range is ok but you learn to change your operating style to maintain the charged batteries where you feel comfortable, for me I don't let it go below about 30% even with the REX. For an urban car its great for anywhere else, I'd think twice. I have had my car for nearly 1/2 year and generally like the car...would I buy another one? Maybe. Here's the rub: The technology is good but not great, the BMW i app that goes with the car is unimpressive; the ratings on the app store are surprisingly bad. It only has a few features that matter and those are pretty predictable. I'm really unimpressed with the integration with smart phone, I expected a lot more on an electric car (see TESLA). One would think, BMW Engineering would do a better job with an app on an all electric car. As to reliability: first, I had software problems with the entertainment system, the XM radio suddenly went dead. The car spent almost 10 days in the dealership while they tried to figure it out finally replacing just about everything...not good. Secondly the tires, this is the second set of Bridgestone's I've had problems with on a BMW. My first were the Bridgestone run flats on a previous late model M3, on that car I replaced 8 tires in 2.5 years for simple punctures. So far the i3 seems on track to beat that record. In 6 months I've already replaced 2 tires for simple punctures. (i3 has no spare) and the i3 are not run flat so the problem gets a whole lot worse. One would have thought that with no spare and no run flat, BMW would have required a highly reliable tire from Bridgestone...they didn't. So overall, a qualified recommend...urban car only, electronics and tire problems, weak mobile app but fun to drive, adequate range and peppy."
car_1328,Ok car,"8 months and 7700 miles so far. It runs ok. Driving it on deep snow is a huge challenge. Almost impossible to control it. 80 miles in summer and around 60 miles in winter on one charge. Installed 240V, 32Amp, ClipperCreek charger. No problems at all, charges the car within 3.5 hours from empty to full.Got it for 280/month with taxes for 12k miles per year. Car is not worth a cent over this price for lease. Already have uneven tire wear. More significant on rear than on front tires. I did not expect tires to last 60k miles but at least 20-25k miles. Stealership stated it is a ""normal"" tire wear. I almost expected them to offer me a lifetime oil change on this car, that is how knowledgeable they are. Wonder if they know any better ..."
car_1329,19 Months and Lovin' It!,"After reading some of the other reviews, I needed to speak up - it appears that either the purchasers did not research the car, or they are exaggerating. I have a BEV - no gas engine. I have driven the car more than 17,000 miles in the past 19 months. In that time, I have not had the car require service - there is nothing that goes wrong. Very simple. I will say that it is a city car - do not buy it if you are hauling a group of folks around the country. I have a Level 2 charger at home ($600 to $1,200 depending on the location and access of your service) - DOES NOT NEED TO BE A BMW-Branded charger (as some might make you believe). Never has taken more than 3-1/2 hours to charge (it will take 20 hours with a standard 120 volt plug).  This is a perfect, quick, nimble ride. I love it! I traded a 535xi SW for this (which is a very different car). My other cars are a 325i and a Mini Cooper S. Recommend doing the overnight test drive offered by BMW if you are serious."
car_1330,BUGGY,"do not BUY, car is very buggy. Will get warning lights every mnth, Engine light 4 times !lots of flat tires reportedTires are expensive.Handling is like a golf cart"
car_1331,I3 the electrical failure,Has abundant of electrical issues. Especially with the drive train. The vehicle went to the shop for over four times within a 50 day span and has yet to be resolved. My I3 is a LEMON.
car_1332,Horrible experience -returned  in one day!,"We purchased this car, I loved the look and everything about it.  We were told it would charge over nite in our garage.  When we got it home the car showed it wouldn't be charged for 20 hours.  Then it runs for about 100 miles on that charge.  The BMW chargers are about $6,000 and then it is a shorter charge time.  After paying $60,000 for a car we didn't want to spend that.Other chargers can screw up the system.  We returned the car and on the way back to the dealership at 45 miles an hour trying to reserve the power to get there, a tire blew out and completely shredded so there was no tire left.  After you pay top dollar for the car there are thousands of dollars of upgrades and insurances.Be sure to pay for the tire insurance, they insisted we would need it because of the low profile of the tires they don't last very long but we never dreamed one would blow out the first day we had the car.  Wasted two days and will never buy an electric car after this!"
car_1333,Long Term Drive,"Routinely getting around 85 miles per charge in city driving. Used about 2 gallons of gas with the range extender in 13,000 miles. After completing the customer satisfaction bulletins and the learning curve with the service technicians, we have had zero maintenance issues. Using the lower output Voltec charger required setting the vehicle charge settings to less than maximum charge...BMW was unaware this would work, and wanted to sell us a higher output BMW charger. A/C works great in Las Vegas. Car is very responsive and fun to drive in the city."
car_1334,Tires worn out in less than 3 Months /2000 miles,"I was shocked when I looked at the tires of my new I3 that I bought two and a half months back. Rear tires have lost their tread completely. I mean completely that the steel wires are showing.
The car had been wobbling and shaky from day 1 even at 25-40 mph speed . Took it to the dealership and they said it has small tires and this is usual. My other friends who have this car had the same tire experience in 6 months.

I am totally distraught with I3 experience ."
car_1335,Most efficient EV in the market,"i3 is the most efficient in current market.  It is the lightest EV  (thanks to CFRP).  I can get 4mi/kWh easily.  Battery is 22kwh, but only drive able with 19Wh.  VW eGolf is nice, but you can't compare acceleration to an i3.  MB B Class is just too heavy and it does not have DC FC option.  In comfort mode, you can drive it as an ultimate driving machine.  In Eco Pro or Eco Pro +, you can drive it with efficiency.  You need to plan ahead for long trip.  I have 1300 miles in a month and total cost to charge is $25.  (There are some free charging stations).  There is no gasoline Tax."
car_1336,Driving a Spaceship,"I have the base model without range extender, but this is my commuter car around the city with chargers on each end. It's not practical for a weekend trip outside the range unless you plan your travels in stages with 2+ hours in between for recharging, but I love this car for commuting to and from work (32 miles each way). It's a funky, awesome exterior and the interior build quality is eco-luxury. I love the carbon fiber details and the eco-leather on the seats. The accent lighting makes me feel like I'm driving a spaceship. Also I love how BMW is really into the electric car movement by creating new manufacturing and technology to build them. It's not just a compliance car here!!!"
car_1337,Its a BMW and an EV!,"I have driven BMWs for 10+ years and this all-electric BMW lives up to the ultimate driving machine claim. It is sporty and solid and handles the road like my 328i. It is filled with high technology with a large screen for nav, music, apps, and information. The construction is solid and the carbon fiber and all-aluminum construction makes the car safe and rust-free. Bodywork is actually less costly than a steel car. This is not for long trips as the practical range in temperate weather is 80-90 miles. But get the DC fast charge option as that has helped me go 300+ miles at times."
car_1338,22000 miles and 18 gallons of fuel later,"I originally ordered a I3 BEV Terra. The plan was to keep our old Prius as my ""airport car"" (I'm a pilot) and the I3 would be my fun car. I reran the numbers and decided to sell the Prius and get a Range Extender. I love it. My first BMW. Great driving experience. No range anxiety. Back seat is fine for 6 foot driver and rear passenger for around town (it's a city car). Air conditioner battles Texas heat just fine. My power bill has gone up $60 a month, but that's for TWO electric cars (my wife has a Leaf). There's no going back.***update.***I've had the car for more than 2 years now. There have been a few software and hardware updates. Nothing has left me stranded.The biggest annoyance has been BMW Dealers. The BMW Dealer network still (2 + years later!) doesn't care to learn about the car or typical i3 owners. The few times I  have had to bring the car in for service it seemed like it was the first time they had seen one.I still love my I3. Each time I drive it I still get excited. When I go on vacation by air (which is very common as I work in the travel industry and fly free) I hate renting a ""normal"" car as they shift, vibrate and are very expensive (comparison wise) to operate. If I had to do it all over again I'd still buy an i3. I did an Owners Choice w/Flew (they no longer offer the flex option). The car is in my name, but I can (and likely will) give it back after 4 total years of ownership. The expected payoff/balloon is $19K. It will be worth far less than that as 2 year old identical cars are selling for $23K right now."
car_1339,The Future is Here Today,"Revolutionary from the ground up, sitting on top of a aluminum skateboard with batteries underneath in a carbon fiber passenger space capsule while seated in a Swedish living room and catapulted forward with instant, silent torque.Perfect size, design, airy, comfortable, quick, awesome turn-in, one-foot driving.Honestly thrilling.The proof of the pudding is in daily traffic (vs. a test drive on a freeway which is also awesome) when you wish to place yourself in a certain position and the car is already there by the time you think about it, and you made no fuss while not making a fool of yourself.Unique functionality, purposeful build to be an EV; achieves mission perfectly."
car_1340,Tranny issues that cannot be resolved!,"Do not buy this car unless you have a written warranty on all aspects of the SMG transmission. The dealer will sell you this car as an automatic with a 3rd party warranty, but when it fails, and it will, the 3rd party says that it is a manual transmission with normal wear and tear.... $15000 later you will still have a car that doesn't work! Anyone need any M6 parts??"
car_1341,A civil 996 turbo,"A high tech car that fits the needs of a serious well healed car enthusiast. If you are not comfortable with computers and spirited driving this car is not for you. Surprisingly refined - I enjoy driving it more than my more visceral, in your face 2003 996 turbo. Great daily driver if you use the paddles otherwise difficult to drive smoothly in automatic mode."
car_1342,BMW M6,"Got this 08 M6 (wht on dark red, CF trim, manual) as a corporate trade in. Wow 08 leases tanked and I lucked out. Had an 06 M3. This thing blows it away in luxury terms and is god awful fast off the line and at speed. In my M3 I always felt like I was driving a hyper jet fighter, always charged up,  and pushing it. In the 6, I cruise in luxury, steel fist in velvet glove. When I want power I hit the M button and zoom. The 3 was an smg and the 6 is  a 6 speed manual. I loved the smg and sometimes wish the 6 had one. Man you could just hammer the 3 all the time. In th 6 it takes some work. Yeah it's capable but you have to wake up and push it. Doesn't seem as tossable, but when you get it right"
car_1343,Awesome Car,I have owned many types of expensive vehicles but this one tops the list. Power is absolutely thrilling as well as the handling and comfort. A little hard on fuel but considering the way I drive it's probably much better for the average driver. I did not buy this car to save on gas anyway. I would have paid double than what I paid for this car.
car_1344,Exotic Ride for Mid Range Expense,"My M6 Coupe is my fifth new BMW. I’ve had a 96 2.8 Z3, 99 540, 03 M3 convertible, 06 750 Li. All of these vehicles have been outstanding.  The M6 is a pure breed race car in a stealth body. This car is great fun when the unknowing pull up beside you at a light and on the back roads of WV. This is by far my favorite car ever."
car_1345,M6... oh yeah baby!,"Unbelievable car. Started my addiction with a 645, then a 650, both of which were great cars, fun to drive, quick and superior handling.  But the M6 is in a class by itself.  What an amazing combination of style and engineering superiority.  It lopes along in daily traffic with no hint of the beast lurking beneath the surface just waiting for a chance to get loose.  It never fails to turn heads, and it never fails to thrill when that big V10 jumps to life with the touch of a button."
car_1346,Two great cars in one!,"This is a great car for the money! I traded a 911 Porsche Cab and a 2005 Aston Martin DB9 coupe - the M6 Convertible delivers the best of both of these cars. The V10 engine has plenty of power matched by electronics and a finely tuned suspension to create a great driving experience on any road. It has the toss-around feel and open sky fun of the Porsche with the size, comfort and presence of the DB9 - but it accommodates 4 riders. This is my first BMW, and I've found the professional reviewer's concerns with iDrive to be somewhat exaggerated. The SMG transmission, also scorned, is easy and engaging to drive. The cock pit ergonomics, including seat comfort are unmatched by any car."
car_1347,'08 M6 Coupe,"Super car performance for less than super car price.  Looked at the R8, Vantage, 911 turbo, MB SL 63, M3, but in the end nothing compared to the total package and performance of the M6.  This car is not done justice in photos.  It is much more beautiful in person.  Definitely drives like an exotic super car."
car_1348,I wanted more!,"After several BMWs I got my first 6 series in the form of a 2004 645 coupe. I loved that car, the way it handled, the performance etc. Then I decided to drop the top and got a 2007 650 convertible which was even nicer than the 645's engine. After trying M5s and M6s at the BMW Performance Center in SC I was immediately sold. That's when I knew my next car would be an M6. I didn't think there would be that much difference, but it's just amazing! The V10 engine is a dream and SMG is very smooth and responsive. iDrive is even more user friendly than its earlier versions and it's worth the couple of hours it may take you to get fully acquainted with it. Performance lovers, rejoice!"
car_1349,Once you go M6 you will never go back,"It's the best bang for the buck 3 years old M6. By the way, make sure you get the full extendend warranty and maintenance for the car."
car_1350,Best value especially used!,"This is a great car I Baught mine new and unfortchently will lose a lot of money. What can I say I use it as a daily driver and I have 88,000 miles in three years and have had no issues with the car. Fuel economy isn't good but it is worth it when you can zoom up to over 100 in just a few seconds and for the size of the car it handles great in all the difference drive settings. My wife has M1 and I get M2 so there's a comfort and sport one. Best air conditioning is ever had and best ventilated seats in ever had. People think it might not hav Aton of space but with the back seats and the removable top we can go make a marketing trip or even buy something huge like a tv and just put the top down. The paint is beautiful I have black. Thanks for reading and I recommend this car completely"
car_1351,Great BMW M6,"BMW m6 do I need to say anymore?the Best car I eve seen!Purchased my M-6 in April 2016, and now It's September 2016 and my wife Connie and I fell in love with our 2013 M-6 with 8000 miles and now with 11.000' miles a still In love with our M-6"
car_1352,Unbelievable,"Prevously I owned a 2009 M3. The new M6 convertible is light years ahead. Nothing on the market compares to the M6 for the cost of this vehicle. Comfort, styling, options and power, it has it all. This car will be hard to top in 7 years when it's re designed again, but I will be there to get it! If you can afford it BUY IT, if you can't afford it test drive it."
car_1353,Simply Spectacular,"After 8 months, the technical brilliance of the M6 continues to overwhelm. The vehicle design is stunning, top up or down, and the views from all sides always bring a smile and a thumbs up from onlookers. The 575 HP produces startling acceleration and the instant choice between automatic and paddle lets you control as much as you like, with the manual so much fun that you feel like a kid again. Engine sounds are thrilling. Brakes are simply awesome, and the very slight understeer from the RWD gives you the feeling of being in complete control at all times. Quality of all finishes is meticulous, and the sound system is symphony hall level. The M6 is simply state of the art, and the only downside is that there are so few roads where this sensational beauty can be driven to its full potential. Fantastic."
car_1354,Need for Speed,"This car is a rocket on wheels.  So fast, yet so refined.  Smooooottthhhhh, almost too smooth.  You step on it at 70 mph and hang on.  The most powerful car I have ever driven.  The scary part is how safe you feel at ultra high speeds.  You feel like you are going 55 mph at 100 mph.  The craftsmanship in the interior of this car is second to none.  Beautiful carbon fiber and the heads up display is priceless when driving this beast.  You don't want to text and drive with this monster.  You could cover almost a mile in the seconds you use keying in ""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.""  This car comes alive at night when all the beautiful exterior and interior lighting packages show their stuff.  It's simply a blend between power and art.  I like the little things like the lighted door sills and the rear view camera that pops out from behind the BMW emblem on the top lip of the trunk lid.  The best part about this exotic sports car is finding a place to service and if necessary repair this beauty.  BMW dealerships exist in plentiful supply across the country.  It's the closest thing I have ever experienced to being in world class video racing game.  If you buy one of these, don't go nuts the first week.  Allow yourself time to acclimate to this beast's personality.  Unless you are an experienced race car driver, you need to hone your skills to match this car's capabilities.  Have fun and be safe."
car_1355,Lovin the i3,"We bought a BMW certified pre-owned 2015 i3 Rex Terra Package with 8,000 miles and have been driving it for about three weeks now.  It is my wife's commuter and driving around town car and she absolutely loves it!  It fits her needs perfectly and she loves driving it.  We have solar panels, so we have not seen any effect on our electric bill.  I installed a 240V 6 gauge 4 wire electric line to the garage that is tied to the breaker box with a double-poled 50 amp breaker.  I then installed a Juicebox 40 Amp 240V Level 2 charger (car charges maximum capacity at 32 Amp so the oversize doesn't hurt as the car will only charge to its maximum capacity) and it can take the charge from depleted to full in about 3.5 hours.  If you install a 240 V charger, be sure to go into the car computer charging settings and change the 240 V charge level from ""minimum"" (which is the default) to ""maximum"" to fully utilize the capacity of your Level 2 charger.  If you are thinking of purchasing an electric car, buy a used one as they depreciate very quickly because of a weak resale market.  For our situation and intended use of this car, it fits us perfectly.  Hopefully it will be a reliable car for years to come."
car_1356,Great Car when it is not in the shop,"It seems that the first few years of a new car there are some bugs. I have owned this car for 2 year and driven it 45,000 miles. It is roomy and drives great. It has also been in the shop 15 times for electronic issues, and recalls. If the electronic bugs are worked out it would be great. BMW does not seem to want to stand by this car. It has a 50,000 warranty and the cost for an extended warranty is over $4,000 for up to 70,000 miles. They do not go above this mileage."
car_1357,BMW i3 Rex First Month Impressions,"After driving the car for a full month I have to say it is a great car. I drive it around 90 miles a few times a week. The range extender has kicked in a couple of times and has taken away the range anxiety. Not having to go to the gas station once a week (sometimes more) is a great feeling. At first I was charging the car using the 110v charger and that was a frustrating experience. It would take anywhere from 17-19 hours. The BMW wall charging station is now installed and this has dramatically improved charging time to 3-3.5 hrs. I went from a X5 3.5i to this car and the car drives and brakes like a BMW with very slim tires. If the tire pressure is too low or too high the driving dynamics change quite a bit. Best to keep an eye on your tire pressure. It leans a bit more when making sharp turns, but nothing like a 80s Cadillac. I enjoy driving twisty back roads and love the instant power. It is addictive... Getting to speed is not a problem, cruising at 75 miles or higher you need to correct the steering a bit more than normal. It took a couple of days to adjust to driving with just the gas pedal. Regenerative brakes are quite aggressive and do assist with slowing the car down quite a bit and only rarely do I need to use the brake pedal. This is something I adjusted to with no issues. The front seats are very comfortable and have good support. Driving position is upright more like an SUV. The back seats are comfortable for passengers under 6 ft. Cargo space with backseats in their position is kind of small, but significantly improves when the rear seats are flattened. Overall I am very satisfied with the experience."
car_1358,not worth the premium,"Bmw dosent stand behind their brand, no promise regular bmw when u need for a long trip.And poor customer backing easy way out each dealer is independently own they can set their polecies.When unlock at what up get is a middle of the road even poor range and u could get the same on the leaf etc.Save 15k to 20k get something else glad is a lease will look at another brand.Bmw is not premium at all is over price garbage"
car_1359,Awesome ride!,BMW i3 is a great ride ... Feels and looks like an iPhone on wheels.  It handles superbly and has the fit and finish found in a BMW.   The acceleration is spectacular.  80 mile range is achievable in the Eco+ mode.  Love the high tech and sustainable construction.
car_1360,Better than expected!,"We test-drove an i3 during BMW's launch in April 2014.  We're impressed but there was no urgency in getting one(yet).  Meanwhile, we continued to monitor its progress and other brands' offerings.Last year(2015), as my two kids started multiple after-school activities which averaged 45 miles round-trips per day, the carbon footprint (and gasoline bills) started climbing.  We decided to look at EV again.  With attractive year-end incentives and government rebates, we went out and bought one.The whole family(especially the kids) is enjoying the new ride.  We feel less guilty about our carbon footprint with this vehicle.  For our use cases, it was the best option.  The rear seats are a bit small(compared to our sedan) but for local travel, it was not an issue.  The acceleration is good and we like the newer technology that came pretty much standard in this car."
car_1361,Edmunds Lease Help with BMWi3 Lease,The Edmunds pricing guideline and leasing suggestions really helped us decide between purchase and lease.It also helped us get a fair price on our lease and to make sure we were fully informed when we sat down with what to ask for and what to watch for.Our BMW dealership was helpful and straightforward in their approach. They answered all the questions that the Edmunds guide suggested that we ask.We really love the car and are still learning about all the technical innovations that it has.
car_1362,Outstanding Car,"Seamless performance and comfort.   Serenely quiet.  The ultimate commuter.   Still digesting that there is really no maintenance - just plug it in at home or the office every few days.    I drive 20-30 miles/day and it is exceptionally well-suited to my use.  I could not be happier the i3 - hard to imagine going back to an ICE after this.Update:  no maintenance issues to date.   Did better in snow with all-season tires than I expected - handled 6"" and some ice on a couple of separate occassions.   Back seat is just for occasional use.   My wife complains that the suicide doors make it particularly challenging to access the back seat when parked in a parking lot.   I never did buy the charger.  Just plug into wall outlet and let charge overnight."
car_1363,Sold the V12 Mercedes to go electric,"I hesitantly sold my Mercedes CL600 and decided to lease the i3 REx to replace it.  I am not a tree hugger but I am a technology geek and the i3 has some fantastic technology built in.  My first impression of the i3 was that this is one ugly car and I did not like the look of the pizza cutter tires.  However, after driving it for several weeks, not only have the looks grown on me (as well as the 20 inch skinny tires), but i find it the car extremely enjoyable to drive.  In fact, it is so enjoyable that my wife prefers the drive to her Range Rover Sport and is constantly asking me to leave it at home so she can drive it.  The off-the-line acceleration is fantastic, which has helped alleviate the sorrow of losing my V12 gasoline engine.  The interior room for the front occupants is extremely roomy (I am 6'1"" with a large frame).  For a sub-compact car, this feels roomier than most other much larger cars.  The user interface took a while to learn, but now that I am familiar with it, I am very impressed.  The entertainment options are endless, especially when I connect my iPhone and use all of the music, streaming and pod cast services.  I use the car primarily to commute to work, 36 miles round trip.  I am also able to charge the car at work.  For commuting, the car is ideal.  I do have the range extender, but I have never actually used it as I have good charging options between work and home but it does take range anxiety out of the equation.  If I had to pick anything that I don't like, it is the placement of the electrical charging port, which is located on the back, passenger side of the car.  This requires me to get the charging cable and walk around to the other side.  While this is clearly a first-world problem, it would have been much easier to locate the charging port close to the driver's door.  The materials inside are excellent and I especially like the wood in the dash.  I leased the vehicle because I am not yet comfortable with the residual value of an EV, but given the subsidies available, and the fact that I no longer buy gasoline, this is a very economical vehicle to operate.    Overall, I was just looking for a very different car experience from buying another internal combustion car.  The experience so far is highly recommended."
car_1364,i3 VS 2013 Chevy Volt,"My volt lease was up and I couldn't extend to wait for the 16 volt.  So I wanted to stay electric and this was the only other choice with ""range extending"" capabilities.   So as a VERY happy Volt owner I was very worried about changing.  So here is the deal.  Had the car a week with a mix of city and freeway driving at speeds up to 75 mph.  BMW -the plusses:   way faster acceleration .  Way quieter ride. Better road feel and solid feeling.  Perfect regenerative braking. Much roomier cabin and comfort for tall folks ( Im 6'3). Better/Great turning radius.  Perfect higher but not to high seating/drivin position.  Easy In&Out.   Considerably better battery range - about 72 miles / compared to 38 miles.  Better regenerative battery charging in city driving.  Able to extend mileage better. Much better BMW 4 year full maintenance warranty.    Love the ""coast"" mode when you just ease off the gas just right.   One pedal driving!!  Love that!  Easier access to rear seats.  Better safety features ( adaptive cruise control with city stop start is awesome).  Have not seen this on another car.  Set it for 40 mph.  Brings you to a stop in traffic and stays engaged.  Then starts you up again when the light changes.  Pretty much auto pilot driving.  Auto magic Parallel parking mode.  (Have not tried this yet so can't say if it actually works well or not). Traffic nav system included with best energy routes based on traffic. Better solid German build quality compared to volt.  Switch gear , fit and finish.So whats not to like that the Volt does better?  Ride still to ""stiff"" and I have the 19"" wheels.  It's on the border of being the perfect balance.  The 20"" wheels have a lower profile tire so I am sure they would make the ride even more stiff which would not be good.  I don't know why so many car manufacturers keep making such stiff suspensions when most americans like a softer ride.  Cant you find the right balance?  Some cars do, but a lot don't.  (Rumor is the new 2016 volt will have a better ride quality than the current model).   Also not good in the BMW is the car is a bit ""skittery""  on broken pavement when taking a turn.  Especially the back can kick out.  This is because it is very light and the tires are very thin.  But the regular handling on decent roads feels good but the steering is very ""sensitive.  Especially at freeway speeds.  The slightest movement of the wheel really moves the car.  I may get used to this but for now I have a harder time keeping the car in a straight line.  Don't know if this is the thin tires or light weight or weight of the electric steering or a combination of all three but this is where the volt drives much better.  User customization of the many features of the car is lacking and much better in the Volt.  Range extender engine is much quieter in the BMW but has only a 1.9 gallon tank which will get you about 60 miles more if full.  Volt holds 8 gallons so gets you the range of a regular car.  So the BMW is really a city car with the bonus of if you need to make a ton of trips across town in one day, you can do it.   So if you are cool with just  a city car you should not have any concerns about the BMW.  Larger side mirrors on the volt are better.  New volt will have lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring.  BMW doesn't have that.  Kind of baffling as this is tech that many cheap american cars now have.  In particular blind spot monitoring is a very worthwhile feature in my opinion.  Oh forgot.  Volt radio , even the high end Bose upgrade is not that good. It's OK but The BMW with the upgraded Harmon radio is great in comparison.  Big beef.  Charging port on the BMW is on the passenger side REAR of the car!  So pretty much you need to back in to any parking space or your home if you want to charge.  The volt is just in front of the drivers door.  Perfect spot.  Not sure I understand the logic of the rear charging door.  But the BMW has a lighted charging port that changes colors.  cool.  Also BMW has super fast Tesla like DC charging built in at no extra cost.  Now if only you can find a DC charging station.  Someday. Some of the interior ""eco"" materials used on the BMW make it feel weird and cheap.  It is recycled material but it looks like crap.  I'm sure the germans can figure out a way to make recycled material look nice and have a soft finish which would make the car even quieter.  Cost.  Volt is 10,000 cheaper for the loaded model.  Thats a big difference.  The volt in three years has been almost 100% trouble free.  A very rare thing for a high tech car.  i give GM very high kudos for building such a high quality car that has not needed to be in the shop. Summary?  I'm liking the much quieter ride and super power acceleration and better comfort of the Beemer. The unique styling can be a turn off for some but I think it grows on most people.   Now lets see if it is as reliable and trouble free as the volt.  I hope so.   I'll report back after more driving."
car_1365,Shockingly wunderbar!,"I have had my i3 for just one week and I am in love with it.  I was impressed with the interior passenger space.  More interior storage space would have been helpful.  I moved into the i3 from a Chrysler Town and Country so the transition was difficult.  But, the driving fun is worth the loss of cubicles.I have had no problems with the car and typically drive it about 60 miles a day.  The Level 1 charger that came with the car is more than adequate to fill it up overnight.  Living on the east coast, there are many charging stations nearby, most of them FREE!  And, I didn't get the gas engine option because I wanted to just go plug-in.My one criticism would be the manual.  It seems to be written in a computer translated English.  I asked a friend from the UK about some of the terms and he couldn't identify them either.  Further, the entertainment center has a handbook on-line but it should come with the car in print form. Have fun driving electrically!"
car_1366,BMW i3 Breaks first week,"Our BMW i3 broke and is in the shop after only 1 week.The car is now going on 3 weeks in the shop for repair of AirBag, Restraint issues.We are being told Germany Tech is working with the USA Tech. Unbelievable a 50K car that is broke, takes this long to repair and requires the help of Germany to repair.Update since first post:Car has been in repair now 3 times, the latest as on June 2016, the check engine light is ON, Dealer says BMW Engineers are trying to find out why. The car is always broken. Funny thing, when I went to drop off my i3 for repairs, there were 2 i3's in front of me, one so bad they had to put it on a dolly to move it.Let me also point out a few of the down sides of owing this car:1. The rear doors opening in the suicide fashion are also not a very good design, especially in parking lots with other vehicles parked close by. For example, say you have a child, you need to open both the front door, then the rear. You are now trapped between two doors, you have to fight with one of the doors to keep closing then opening to get to the stroller to get your child. Also if you are shopping and need to put things in the rear seat, same thing. A REAL PAIN... Don't believe me, give it a try with cars parked on each side that hug the white stripe. Then you will wish you din't have this car.Next the rear storage is small at best, you can't fit a full size stroller in the rear. If you do have a stroller, then you have no place for groceries.Now on to the body of the car, it is really a collection of plastic parts snapped together, most are very flimsy at best, and if you really stand back and look at the car, there are at least 4 different colors on the car. Looks like an erector set gone bad. The fit is also not very good. The front gas cover is really a terrible design with the locking as the pin is at the bottom and can be easily opened. Just a waste on the lock. So many curves and design elements. A real pain to clean the outside with so many panels and shapes.Next, did I say the rear windows do not roll down. They don't and another let down.  The tires are very different and skinny, makes the car very un stable feeling when you hit a smooth bump in the road such as a railroad track crossing, you can feel the car slide. Also if it's wet outside, even worst! Please don't speed around any corners with these skinny tires. Overall, the car has many short comings and things you never think about until you have it. It was neat looking in the showroom. In the real world, this is one of the worst cars I have ever owned/leased. I can only say that my feelings around BMW is this, a HIGH PRICE for such a TERRIBLE BUILT CAR. I've learned that BMW stands for ""BUILT MORE WORST"".Would I do it again, NO!!"
car_1367,Great automobile except for...,"I agree with Diane.  It is a terrific electric car, with great performance and handling, a beautiful interior, fine ergonomics, and great fun to drive.  That said, it is  not ready for prime time.  BMW USA has so far failed to get serious about the electric market. The super-fast charger receptacle is not compatible with any in my NC and there are only a few in the whole U.S.!!  Nissan has 1-2 hour  chargers at many (most) dealers.  BMW has zilch.  Why not? My dealer says too expensive to install.  Thus long trips are on gasoline, unless you can find a ChargePoint station and feel like taking a 4-5 nap while charging.  Unless BMW gets serious I'll switch brands when the 2-year lease is up."
car_1368,Awsome vehicle!,"Used primarily as a daily drive to/from work, 48km each way.  Thisleaves 15km - 40km at the end of the day.  Level2 charger in the garage keeps the BMW i3 BEV full.Off the line and even on the highway this is a very responsive car.The high seating position and very open design gives a great view of the road.Figure on saving about $2,500 per year due to 1/10th energy costs and 1/2 maintenance and service costs.A very practical and fun car to drive for me, makes the commute that much better. Service costs are very low, and the car has excellent reliability."
car_1369,great car,"m6 with competition package, have had e39 and e60 m5 previously, with the competition package, m6 is much more alive, ready to play, be ready to explain to the officer why you cannot behave, best play car I have owned since e36 m3, plus much much faster"
car_1370,"They are right, the transmission is bad!","I love  this car as it is very fast and its a real head turner; however, the tranny is like what others say, it is really herky jerky.  In m mode at a stop light, it has a tendency to jump gears and jerk the car, first time I thought I got rear ended.  At times, there is also a lag when you gas it, it takes a while to get moving... might be dangerous when you are cutting lanes real quick.  120k for this????"
car_1371,"Great car, HORRIBLE TRANSMISSION","I should have test driven my M-6 before laying out well over 100 grand. The ""automatic transmission"" on this car is horrendous. Buyers remorse? Definitely. I am looking into trading it for one with a full manual transmission-or just taking my lumps and getting rid of it completely. My Chrysler 300 SRT 8 is a better driving much more user friendly vehicle. At some point more is too much. BMW definitely surpassed that point with this ""F1 inspired"" drive train."
car_1372,Just got one,"Just bought one and the reviews are right, the transmission is herky jerky.  Other than that, is it a real head turner"
car_1373,Flagship 650i lives up to the title,This car has great performance and the used prices are good for most budgets. It also has great styling and the convertible adds a whole new dimension to the driving experience.
car_1374,"The beast ride, great value for the money","The beast ride, great value for the money"
car_1375,In a class of its own,"Anyone considering a luxury sports coupe should at least test drive this car.  It has a perfect balance of performance, luxury and comfort.  I'm 6'6"" and fit comfortably both in terms of leg, shoulder, and head room.  The car is whisper quiet at all speeds, handles amazingly well, and accelerates effortlessly from any speed to any speed.  Other cars may do one aspect of this car's package better, but no other car on the road has such a complete offering."
car_1376,EYE CATCHING,"This car is very reliable, but servicing this vehicle can be pricey. Make sure you go to a shop that is very familiar with BMW vehicles. This is a nice luxury vehicle that likes to show off its interior.  Smooth comfortable ride. Performance and handling is what you would expect from BMW. Not sure I would want this as my only car but it is a nice addition to the SUV."
car_1377,The great hype,Just bought this car this past august.  I've seriously have driven the car no more than two weeks.  This car is already a nightmare.  Gasket leaks and misfiring issues. Should have stuck with Mercedes. BMW dealer can't even pin point the issue.  Very poor customer service. BMW of Peabody ma. Stinks. I'm ready to throw in the towel at this point.
car_1378,Old Age Friend,"Owned a 308, a 365, two Aston Martins, a slab sided Cobra, more MBZs than I can forget and I have to say this is the finest all around automobile I have ever owned. The car is dependable, forgiving and a joy to drive hard and fast. Spent 14k at 90,000 to replace items that had not yet failed but what does it matter since my old chum has never let me down. Am now at 203,000 miles and all is still well."
car_1379,Love the car - Hate the headaches,"Reliability is an issue -right now I need to take the car to the shop to get the engine gaskets replaced, the intermittent PDC failure analyzed, the trunk lock sensor fixed so that I can open it with the remote, the brake fluid flushed, the interior filter replaced, brake pads replaced, etc."
car_1380,BMW 645 Convertible,"Without a doubt the best car I ever owned. I have had Mercedes, BMW 530i, Ferrari 355 (2 years old) several Porsche 911's and this is just such a great car. Economical, fast, brilliant handling, stylish, practical, great sound system, reliable. I cannot fault the car and abolutely love it."
car_1381,the perfect car,"you can not ask for a more better car. The speed is their the look is their the reliability is there it is just and overall perfect car i put on some 21"" chrome BMW rims and everyone looks when i drive by its the best car BMW makes"
car_1382,A Piece of Art but also A Piece of Junk,"My wife and I feel in love with our 05' BMW 645i conv. when we first picked it up.We purchased it Jan. 2011 used with only 33,000 miles on it.It had some years on it but we figured it would get several years of only normal maintenance type services and not need to worry about major mechanical or electric problem because of it's low mileage and series.After all this is one of BMW's flagship cars.While the car gets looks of admiration at stop lights the feeling of this wears out quickly when you count how many dollars and time it has spent in a BMW repair shop.The BMW 645i is like buying a boat - the 2 happiest days of ownership are the day you buy it and the day you get rid of it."
car_1383,Unreliable starts,"At first I loved this car. I'm a low mileage driver and BMW tells me the car is meant to be driven a lot. If you don't drive it a lot this car is a life of hell.The BMW dealer told me if I don't drive it at least one day a week for an hour the battery will die. He said there is too much draining the battery. It's not a week though.Seven starts drains the battery.I keep it on a trickle charge, but that apparently doesn't keep it from draining. Afterthe battery drains a couple dozen times, its time for a new battery which today cost over $500.That's not acceptable but what is really unacceptable is having an $80,000 car that leaves me stranded and calling AAA once a week."
car_1384,I Love this Car!,"The finest car I have ever owned.  I have had other BMW's, Mercedes, Volvos, 400 HP muscle cars and nothing compares to this car.  It is in a class of its own when it comes to BMWs."
car_1385,There are better options,"I think you can have a much better car for the same money.  My car has been giving me a lot of headache with the operation of the roof; it stops working without previous notice and not even the BMW guys know why is that. She still is covered by the warranty but my concern is when it's over I'll be the one paying every time this happens again.  Other than that, she runs ok but the engine isn't that amazing considering it's a V8 (should have much more grunts and ponies). Anyway, I wouldn't buy it again. Next time, I'll try Mercedes, Porsche or Audi."
car_1386,What a BEAST Machine,"Drove 3-series all my life until I got this beast.  6 speed is out of this world. Acceleration, handling and cornering couldn't be finer.  I swapped out the run flats immediately even though there was only 19,000 on car.  What a difference without that extra weight.  Less expensive too.  First gear buries the tach a little too fast but you get use to the quick shift to second.  I took it to the limit 160+ once and it was still quiet in the rag top.  The iDrive is simple once you read the manual.  Quality and variations of the LOGIC7 is theater- like.  I'm 6'7"" and the cockpit is very accommodating.  I just love my BEAST for power and style."
car_1387,I love this car,"Drives like a dream, tremendous pick-up, wonderful sight lines.  The top is quick and easy to raise or lower.  The iDrive is easier to use than most reviewers seem to experience."
car_1388,6 Series - Buffed Elegance,"Great car. With the sport package, this is truly buffed elegance. I really enjoy the interior and the exterior design. Great sound system. As for the much maligned iDrive. If you don't enjoy being challenged by technology, don't get the iDrive. As for me, I am a techy, so I find the iDrive very functional and entertaining."
car_1389,"For the price nothing come close, except","The only car the come close to the 645ci is a 545i. The design is excellent, ride quality is great, handling out of this world - what's to say more. Go out and drive one"
car_1390,Incredible Machine,"I had read all of the review and was a bit reluctant, until I drove this vehicle.  For a vehicle of this size, it handles and corners amazingly well.  Performance is outstanding!  0- 30 is strong; however, 30-100 is absolutely incredible and leaves most everyting in the dust.  To top it off the ride is compliant, the seats are the most comfortable I have ever encountered, the logic 7 sound system is amazing - even at super legal speeds with the top down.  The much maligned I Drive in now very intuitive - once you read the manual just once.  This is the best car I have ever owned or driven!  It you are looking for a great convertible - at any price - this is it!"
car_1391,BMW 645ci coupe,"Awesome comes to mind.  Great road handling, great pick-up speed, great sound system and a car that receives a lot of ""double takes""."
car_1392,Value of iPod,"Driving this BMW is a great experience each time I start the engine, except for the iPod screen warning that comes up everytime. I treat it like an annoying child, and try not to pay attention to it. Finally, though I have to acknowledge it to work the radio, ect.  Oh well, small price to pay I guess, for a great car. I was surprised the visibility in the convertible with the top up was excellent. This is really a 2 person car, with room for 2 small children."
car_1393,Wonderful car but too many problems!,"We loved everything about our 2005 645I convertible.  Talk about a car that catchs everyone's eye and is a blast to drive!  But....we had so many problems with ours we regretfully ended up giving it back under the lemon law.  It was in the BMW service dept 32 days between July 6 and Oct 1, 2006 - not counting weekends!  We were told it had 19 computers by 15 manufacturers and the glitchs weren't worked out yet.    We expected more from an $80,000 car but agree we'd buy another one if we were promised it wouldn't have so many problems!"
car_1394,BMW 911,"My first BMW is my 99-528 that I drive daily and can't say enough about so I was destined for another. I was between a 645 and 745. I chose the 645 and have not been disappointed. I do miss the ability to take the 3rd or 4th passenger on occasion, however the ride, handling and looks far outweigh that. I also own a 911 and am considering getting rid of that to upgrade the 528 to a 745. The 645 gives me eveything I was getting from the 911. The only problem I have had is the navigation has been occasionally acting up, saying ""can't read disc"" I'm scheduled to take it in next week so hope it's an easy correction."
car_1395,Buy ONE,"Don't drive this car unless you're prepared to purchase one. I went to the dealer to test drive a 7 series. I thought I would just compare it against the 6, so I test drove one and purchased it right afterwards. This car is above and beyond any thing I have ever owned.   I like it. I purchased the sport model and the back seat isn't a problem. If you want a big back seat buy a 7 series. I love all of it."
car_1396,Wow - Automotive engineering marvel,"Having owned several sports cars such as the 92 Acura NSX, 97 Porsche 993 C2S (911), and 03 Boxster S, I was blown away and extremely impressed with the overall package BMW delivers with its legendary 6 series.  Absolutely amazing piece of engineering.  I was impressed enough to opt out of another Porsche purchase.  Granted it isn’t a Porsche Cab or Carrera, albeit that's probably a good thing.  Tight handling, absolutely sexier when you have the top down, and the more I look at this car, the more I lust after it.  Great value too.  Makes a nice sister to our 2005 745i.  Gorgeous, elegant, sleek, and fast."
car_1397,The Best!,Just purchased my 645ci May 05 and what a spectacular ride. Turns on a dime. Smooth. Lots of power. Great touring vehicle. This is my third BMW and I rate the BMW as the best to own. Surpasses any other auto I've owned and driven. Can't beat the service and care they give to the customer not to mention the vehicle. I highly recommend this car if you want something practical but sporty. People give second and third looks when you're driving this dream machine. I wouldn't consider another maker. I've been sold on BMW for years. Still have first original/first BMW (525i) When our last child starts driving the Mini Cooper is at the top of the list of consider- ations. Thanks BMW!
car_1398,This car rock,"I love it.  I love BMWs, compared to my old M3, this car absolutely is amazing and i highly recommend it for anyone looking for a new car.  One downside, the back seat could use more headroom and space.  The 3 series probably has more than the 6, which is weird.  Overall though, the car rocks."
car_1399,Sexy car,A ride in this car will allow you to forget all of your problems!  It is my pleasure everytime I get in this car!
car_1400,It ROCKS,Best car I've ever owned...remarkable blend of sport and luxury.  You can feel as though you are in a refiined automoble -- or driving a killer sports car.  I cannot say enough about how I totally LOVE this car.
car_1401,the fabulous 6 series,a truely fine machine. outstanding performance with one of a kind style
car_1402,Waiting for a M6,"The tiptronic takes a bit of getting used to. It is very different and you should be very familiar with it before ordering this option. If you get a 04, it will not have bluetooth, and it will cost you over 2500 to get it retrofitted. The phone that comes with the car is junk, and neither BMW nor Cell companies will take any responsibility of hook it up. The microphones for the phones are junk. There are two possible upgrades that they will only tell you about after you complain loudly that people cannot understand you when calling from your car. I still only know about 100 of the 500 functions the I drive is able to perform. The dealership also does not know how it operates, figure it out!"
car_1403,bmw 6,"An awesome combination of power, style and comfort.  A luxury coupe that handles better than most sports cars.  I took advantage of the BMW performance driving school which is free to all 6 series purchasers.  This vehicle is one ultimate driving machine.  The glass sunroof fills the entire front compartment--like a glass top convertible. Excellent."
car_1404,Best Car I've Ever Owned,"This car is by far the best BMW, or vehicle I've have owned."
car_1405,The best and most fun car I ever owned,"I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed and am still enjoying this car after almost 1 year. I have had every type of car you can think of. However each car gets ""stale"" after a while. This car is sooo different I enjoy driving this car everytime. I live in Florida in the winter and New York the rest of the year. Driving either on Florida Highways or the Streets of New York, this car is amazing."
car_1406,Best car,"The car is wonderful when you’re just cruising, it makes a little purr but when you put it in the sport mode and accelerates, it’s extremely loud. When the roof is up it doesn’t make too much noise. And with the roof down it doesn't make those annoying noises that other cabriolets make. The interior is very elegant with its ambient lighting."
car_1407,Awesome Coupe,What an excellent ride!  This is my 3rd BMW and I most recently has a Lexus GS430 which was not fun to drive at all.The 645 CI has great power and it just keeps going faster and faster.  Fuel economy is much better than I expected. I average 19-20 miles between city and freeway driving. Learned the whole iDrive system in a week.  This is a good way to keep the dash clean.
car_1408,Wheeee Doggy!,"Since 1992 the only car me and my wife ever drove was the 7 series, there never was another car for us, but got tired of waiting for the new on order 750, decided to try something new. WOW!"
car_1409,2005 645CI Convertible,"When I first learned that BMW was coming back with the six series, I was very interested in seeing the new model.  At the time I was ready to purchase my new car, they were then coming out with a convertible and with everything that I wanted on it.  I had also considered the 745, but upon seeing the 645 there was no doubt in my mind that that was the car for me.  I had a choice of Air Force One or an F- 16.  I elected the F-16 and have thoroughly enjoyed driving it.  Everywhere I go people compliment me on my stunning car.  The car is a dream to drive and have been very happy with it.  I highly recommend it."
car_1410,"Fast, fun, gorgeous and furious!","My husband bought me this car after I had been eyeing it up on line for months.  I could not be happier.  I, too, drove a Porcshe 911 Carrera and the 645 makes that car look like a joke!  I have never had any problem with taking turns at high speeds and the driving experience is simply that... an experience.  The lines on this car are gorgeous and the color combo I chose is just stunning (silver grey metallic with grey top and burgundy interior)!  Definitely gets lots of compliments and stares!  I absolutely adore this car!"
car_1411,love my rag top,"Car runs really well. A lot of goodies for the price. iDrive navigation a bit hard to get used too. Fuel economy on open road is good. Fast times off the line. Sattelite radio, HUD , Sport package really complete the total package. Worth the extra bucks. Only feqature lacking is that side mirrors dont fold via power. A bit noisy with top down, at high speeds !!! I traded in Audi A-4 cabrio, big difference!!! Go for it !!"
car_1412,A Truly excellent Coupe,"This superb coupe provides all the enjoyment of a sports car, plus the additional benefits of useable rear occasional seating (and extra storage space) and a large trunk. The performance and roadholding are also excellent, in the true spirit of BMW."
car_1413,Best I've ever owned,"the 645 Ci is the sixth convertable that I've owned starting with a TR-3 and my last car was a MB SL500.  The 645 is by far the most fun to drive, and the best to be seen in.  I've never had so many people say great things about a car I've  been driving, in car washes, at stop lights, parking lots,etc.etc. You get used to the iControl."
car_1414,Great Touring Car,"The 645 is a great car to drive with the top down or up. The acceleration is good for a car of this size and weight, although it could always be faster. Handling with the sport package is good and I drive quite a bit on winding mountain roads and it handles great. I have yet to feel drift or loose traction even at 80+ on S turns. Acceleration on straights could be better. Overall a great touring car (as advertised)."
car_1415,My Six,"Moved out of a Benz SL600 into the 645CiC. The BMW has better braking, refined seating and no loss of performance; smoother and a much more quiet ride; Unlike the Benz, the Beemer roof line is not friendly to tall people."
car_1416,"No Sports Car, But Great Tourer","Fantastic acceleration and stopping power. Pretty slushy in normal mode, but the ""sport"" button makes it very responsive. Active suspension is incredible. iDrive is a great alternative to dozens of tiny buttons, and is surprisingly intuitive, as is the voice command system. Very quiet and solid-feeling. Turns heads. Main criticism is that the driver is quite isolated from the road. Interior a bit disappointing for a car in this price bracket (lots of plastic, cheap carpet)."
car_1417,No step up from this one.....,"This is the best car I have ever had.  Fun, gorgeous, fits my 6 yr. old in back, he loves it too. Looks like a bullet and drives like one.  Head turning looks, throttle sound in engine is very fun.  Seats are comfortable, the sound system is great, bluetooth for me works perfectly, very little wind blowing inside the car with the top down, even in the back.  Like the window in rear that operates up and down.  My first BMW, only MB before, and I have to say, I am not sure what car will come next.  This will be hard to surpass all the way around..."
car_1418,Best luxury Coupe under 100K,"This car is the nicest luxury sports coupe that BMW has ever produced. This vehicle handles extremely well on all roads including back roads that have twists and turns. My car is a coupe with an automatic transmission. I think this is the best way to purchase this car, especially in regards to resell.  Exterior styling is this car's highlight. I think it looks great from  all angles and people seem to look at it with awe or envy. The gas mileage is very good for a car of this size.I have enjoyed owning this vehicle and so far my car has been problem free."
car_1419,"Fun, Fast & Beautiful","Love the car....have a 6 year old in back at all times...it is still ok for space (better than any other Luxury Conver. we drove)...Power, looks, throttle sound all make for an overall wonderful driving car. Best part of the car...with the top down, you get very little if any wind on your face and head.  My son in the back get a min. amount too.  You can put the top down all year almost with all of the cool/heat features that keep you comfortable.  We could not be happier with the car."
car_1420,It's not a Porsche. But close,"Although it is hard to write a review on this baby being that I used to drive a Porsche, I will try to be as objective as possible. While it is an eye opener, and it definitely attracts the girls, the handling is at fault. Everytime I turn going anywhere over 20 the tires screech unbearably loud. It does, however, offer luxury that a Carrera just doesn't. Overall, it's a sweet car... a little over priced for what it offers, but hey, it looks nice and drives pretty well."
car_1421,WONDERFULLY LUXURIOUS FUN TO DRIVE,"This car is wonderful, drives like a dream, my two kids fit in the back, great agility, stopping, all the airbags are great and convertible top comes up and down at 20 mph or less. The overall design is wonderful, even down to the cup holder - navigation is superb. The iDrive drove me nuts, had to go to a class to learn it, great now that I understand. The Bluetooth is slow with my Motorola v3 phone and sometimes cuts out. My friend from Germany does much better with the voice commands; it doesn't understand a southern accent very well, and gives me the wrong commands at times.   Great car!! Fast and fun and not everyone has one!"
car_1422,Almost Perfect,"As a few more of these cars are on the road here in Virginia, I've begun to notice how truly unique and special. I alternate driving this car and an X5 4.8is purchased this spring for practicality.  While the responsiveness of the car is thrilling, I wish it had better acceleration. It feels quicker, but I know it's not as fast as my X5, and always makes me wish for more. The handling is fantastic, as is the braking.  If I were to change anything, besides the horsepower, it would be the iDrive. While I've mastered it, the touch screen in a previous Lexus and my wife's Sienna are sooo much easier and intuitive to use. Different for the sake of being unique does not excuse this feature."
car_1423,A rush to drive,"This car is a rush to drive. You have to take it around a tight corner at high speed to really appreciate the performance. It hugs the road, no lean, even acceleration. A great driving car.The iDrive is a nuisance, and the run flat tires are unnecessary, but overall it is a thrill to own and drive. Spectacular sound system. Have fun!"
car_1424,Ignore the pundits - Buy this car,"Sure the iDrive is clunky and the fuel economy is poor.  Once you get past those items you'll be in for the fun ride of your life.  The convertible is a head-turner, and a neck-snapper.  Cool performance, design and engineering makes this a great vehicle.  I was looking for a large performance convertible and this Beemer fits the bill."
car_1425,heavenly wheels,"This car has it all and then some. Most fun I've ever had driving. It is an experience... it inspires you to really want to take the car for a drive. It's not transportation , it's entertainment and excitement. I never thought a vehicle could motivate you to drive, but this one does. It's a high performing, head turning machine. If it's in your budget get it and you'll not regret it!!!!!!"
car_1426,Better than the 911 and Merc500,"The 645ci is a driving experience!  No of my friends can understand why I would pay this much for a car, I simply tell them that they have to drive it to understand it.  Handling is excellent, braking excellent, styling excellent, quality is excellent...It's a real head turner for all age groups and gender!"
car_1427,Awesome!,"I traded in my 2004 745i on a 2005 645ci. I had a negative equity of $5k on the 745i but it was worth every penny cause the 645ci is just simply awesome. Nowdays, it seems that everyone has a 745 or a 5 series. The 645ci is so unique. I get many looks on the road. In fact, it reminds me of the old 8 series than the 6 series. I got the sports package which I think gives it a totally different attitude. I love this car so much more than that big 745i."
car_1428,Alva review,"A real fun to drive car, kids love it for a downtown cruise car . Or just to drive around town ,many compliments from neighbors and citizens."
car_1429,Endless Power,"The car is a beautiful head turner with quick acceleration and great braking. That more than makes up for the poorly excuted iDrive. It's the only bad thing about the car. The driving experience  is hindered by this awkward, needlessly confusing gizmo. The integrated Bluetooth phone system does not operate smoothly. The sound system is good. Trunk space is adequate. The exhaust note is thrilling. The front seats are supportive and comfortable. The rear seats are for emergency use and should be considered additional storage. Overall, it's a gorgeous, fast, sturdy, well built ride that will give you plenty of smiles. Driving this car makes me feel good."
car_1430,A PERFECT 10,"There is nothing bad about this vehicle, when I bought it, it was great and it hasn't declined in comfort or performance ever since. Buy this vehicle it is a keeper. I would pay up to a million dollars for it. I have a McLaren F1, and this machine is just as nice if not better. A perfect 10."
car_1431,what a blast,"I've had my 645ci for two months now.  It is the most fun car I've ever driven.  It's a head turner and eye catcher and a road grabber.  BMW hit it out of the park with this one.  Handling and performance are supurb you feel safe and solid in every turn.  I like the lines on the 645CI better than the convertable which looks a bit choppy.  After a month I got used to the improved I-Drive.  The issues I've had are waiting for over two months for sirius radio and my new blackberry phone does not work with the bluetooth feature on the 645.  This car is amazing, I look forward to seeing you in my rearview mirror."
car_1432,midwest owner,My experience with the vehicle has not been good because the dealership has not had trained staff for one. Secondly there are on board computer problems since delivery which have not been fixed. The paint finish is an issue in which small scratches have appeared in the clear coat.  The design seems susceptible to front end/hood damage from road stones. Bluetooth sometimes fails with cell phone.
car_1433,I-drive systems /,"The 645 cic is a fun car to drive. It handles with excellence and attracts the ""nice car"" symbol with the thumbs up everywhere I go. What I am disappointed with is the malfunction of the I drive system (resetting itself or freezing). My roll bar protection for some reason has deactivated itself. I made an appointment on January 3rd to take my car in and unfortunately the next available date is the 20th of February. Very disappointing for a 90k car."
car_1434,Best BMW I have ever driven or owned,"I have owned BMWs since 1977 (3, 5 & 7 series) as well as two Porsche 911s.  The 645 is the absolute best, hands down - performance, drive, feel, style (interior and exterior).  Recommend sport and premium pkgs.  Sport drive is amazing.  The 645 is the perfect balance of performance and comfort.  The sound of the engine is awsome.  And I-drive is very easy to understand."
car_1435,The Best Yet,This is one snazzy car! It is my 3rd BMW and I am on the road (highway) a lot. So reliability is very important. Design people outdid themselves this time.
car_1436,BMW - Bummer,You already know you have overdone it with the electronics. I have 1800 miles on this car and it has been in to the dealership 3 times already. I can't wait for the lease to expire so I can buy a Porsche. Thank god I leased this car and do not own it. Get the idea I'm frustrated? All the problems have been computer related.
car_1437,6 Is the only number!,"An alarmingly fast, stable, barn burner with more panache than I'll ever have. After owning three 5 series I couldn't bring myself to ""love"" the styling of the new 545. The 645 exceeds my expectations for speed, comfort, quickness, looks, control and, did I say speed?"
car_1438,645ci a Homerun,"I fell in love with the looks of the 645ci coupe at an auto show, but with a 430 gs Lexus, there wasn't much reason to spend 80k on a new car.....that it, until I DROVE the 645. What a dream. And worth every penny."
car_1439,Go for it,"This is one incredible car! Great styling is obvious, but it's only the beginning! Beauty is well beyond skin deep... this baby is tons of fun!"
car_1440,What Fun,"This is a super vehicle.We just purchased the car and have absolutely loved driving it.The power, braking, steering of this car are awesome. It's like riding a high tech roller coaster, smooth and on a rail.The iDrive is cool. It IS very easy to use once you navigate thru it a few times. We got this car w/out the sport package and were told it did not come w/run flat tires.This was not the case, as tires marked with the letters RSC circled are run flats. (No spare tires in this vehicle.) Also, the convertible has more head room in the rear seat than the coupe. I am 6' and 210 & I can sit straight up w/some leg room. Coupe I have to tilt my head.Trunk has more room w/top down,then any other in its class."
car_1441,I'm Lovin' It,"Have owned this car for a month.  It 
is the first convertible I've owned, 
and I am in love with it.  The 
handling is superb and the looks are 
fantastic.  I get compliments on the 
car every day."
car_1442,Return of the 6,"The looks eventually grew on me and a 
test drive had me in love with this 
car. There is nothing like it on the 
road and it's closest competitor, the 
CLK500 can't keep up. The M6 with 
500bhp will be a higher degree of 
perfection.  Everything about this car 
shouts fun, style and triple digit 
speeds."
car_1443,The BMW 6-SERIES,"I am loving this car more and more 
every day. The sound system is amazing, 
the handling at high speed on corners 
and curves is the perfect adrenaline 
rush, and yet the ultimate in safety. 
The leather seats conform to your body 
and contrary to the editor's remarks, 
this car is very sexy and its lines 
grab all the attention on the road. 
Even from those ""elite""...not mercedes 
benz owners ( since the editor is so 
bias to those old-man vehicles). thank 
you. The next thing for me will be the 
M6."
car_1444,Love this car!,"Everything about this car is 
beautiful.  The lines on the inside and 
outside were artfully designed.  Even 
the door lights were done in a light 
blue that are more like mood lights 
than glarish dome lights.  It 
definitely attracts attention because 
of it's looks, but it keeps my 
attention, because it is fun.  The 
convertible top lets the sun in easily, 
and the press of the gas pedal lets my 
troubles blow away in the 
wind."
car_1445,Outstanding 645Ci,"The 645 is the marriage of a sports car and luxury 
touring coupe.  The result is a car that can be 
justified as a family as well as a personal 
performance car.  Interior is roomy enough for a 
family of four.  Handling is what sold me on the car 
as well as the build quality and solid feel going 
down the road.  I couldn't justify the convertible 
having owned Mercedes and Lexus hardtop 
convertibles.  The coupe is outselling the 
convertible models according to dealers.  Great car."
car_1446,TOM'S CAR,"My brother Tom bought this car, gave it 
to me and it is UNBELIEVABLE.  Having 
previously owned a 7 series, two 3 
series, and 
even a 2002 TII (wow), these guys never 
fail to amaze me.  This ride is 
extremely smooth, responsive and 
agile.  Now, I gotta go get one myself!"
car_1447,The  best bmw ever,"When i first drove saw this car, i 
knew it was the one for me. When i 
bought it, it made the experience even 
better.  Now i love it"
car_1448,Great idea poor implementation,"This is an exquisite car in form and 
powertrain but it is frstratingly poor 
in terms of enjoyment and ride quality. 
The throttle is too long in regular 
driving but too responsive while in 
sport mode. The iDrive is the single 
most foolhardy idea that BMW has ever 
incorperated. It distracts the drver, 
cannot be used during travel, and 
detracts from the driving experience, 
leaving you frustrated and unfulfilled. 
The driver is very isolated from the 
road again leaving me unhappy and 
frustrated with the car. I personally 
regret my purchase of this particular 
automobile and hope that BMW corrects 
the problems with this car before it 
ruins thier previously infallible 
comapny."
car_1449,Favorite Vehicle that I Have Owned,"I had to buy an AWD SUV for constant trips over the Santiam Pass. I went to multiple dealerships, and this vehicle fit my budget, and was AWD SUV. I bought the vehicle for $9,500 with 120,000 miles. Unfortunately during the entire process, my phone was broken, so I couldn't really research much. Afterward I found out the vehicle at the time was worth a little over $6k, but I have had no buyer's remorse. It gets about 19-23 MPG, which is to be expected on a 2004 SUV. As of Feb 2017, and in Springfield Oregon, it costs me about $45 to fill up my entire gas(premium) tank. The gas tank is 17.7 gallons. The steering is very ""tight"" feeling, as opposed to other cars I've driven. This took me about an hour to adjust to how tight the steering really is, and now I will prefer tight steering going forward. This car is very comfortable, and easy to ride in. It is really spacious, and NOT cramped at all. Men over 6' have plenty of head space/leg space in the front. In the back, they have the same amount of head space, and plenty of leg space depending on who they are sitting behind.  I have almost NO blind spots. The visibility in the vehicle is incredible. I have had 1 incident with this car in Dec 16: the original 2004 starter(the starter was labeled 2004 BMW) went out. So far, no other issues, and I wouldn't really say that a 12 year old starter going out was an issue, it was time! My boyfriend and father were able to diagnose that it was the starter, and they were able to remove the old starter and install the new one for the cost of the starter at $150, from O'Reilly's. I do know, however, that it was difficult for them to do the work, and it took them several hours, as the starter is located in a hard-to-reach spot. I use 5W-30 full synthetic and have the oil/oil filter regularly changed. I use premium gas, as the manual states to do so. My particular model doesn't have a nav system, it only has the ""business stereo"" which is pretty basic, but not too shabby. There are steering wheel controls: radio/cd and cruise control. Excellent heated front seats. A full sunroof, that extends to the back seat. The back trunk isn't too large, but works well for me, and if I need to haul something that takes up more room, I just put the back row seats down. The battery is very accessible. The battery is located in the trunk area under the floor board, and there are charging posts by the battery in the trunk and under the front hood, so you can be jumped (if necessary) by front or back.  Also, the back cargo door can not be opened without the battery in or if it is completely dead. If you have to open the back door, you must climb in the back, lift the back floorboard. In the door there is a small rectangle opening in the middle. Stick a screw driver in the hole and slide it over, then the back door will pop open. My seats are leather, and have no cracking as of Feb 17. There are a few spots(high-use areas) where the leather dye has warn, but not much, and not noticeable at first glance. This car does have an auto-headlight feature, and sensor windshield wipers. The auto headlights work 100% of the time. I haven't quite figured out the windshield wiper sensors, nor have I put time or effort into that."
car_1450,Not your father's Oldsmobile...,"Love the BMW. Although the car starts out as pricey, $35,000 at the time, I don't think I have spent more than $5000 in the time I have owned it, 12 years! Not a very high price to pay to drive such a responsive automobile. The quality is there and all my standard options are just starting to become standard on new cars today. You feel real good driving such a beautiful car. I think there is an elegance that is unique to a BMW owner when driving this vehicle. This is a SOLID vehicle that took a hit from a 20 ton drilling truck and suffered $5000 in body damage. The car has been checked and given a thumbs up as to any major, structural damage. This was three years ago. Seems Sarasota Drilling Company does not believe in maintaining their equipment as I do. Their BRAKES went out and the driver warned his supervisor...Go figure.  They also do not put drivers with a CDL behind the wheels. It is truly a driving machine. Do NOT skimp on tires. The better the tire, the better the handling. Sound system is outstanding. Visibility is excellent unlike other SUVs I have driven. NO Blindspots! It is just a Nice Car and my 3rd BMW. I have also owned the 2000 X3 and a 1988 740i. These cars are excellent investments as based on the resale value that they hold.  Assembled in Austria and the Engine is from Germany. Lots of PEP in this little car! My favorite things about this BMW is the HUGE sun roof and the XENON headlamps that turn with the vehicle."
car_1451,"A great vehicle- now at 184,000 miles","While our X3 hasn't been completely trouble-free over the 11 years and 184,000 miles we have owned it, it has remained a joy to drive. It has adequate cargo space and the interior and exterior have held up very well. Our son took it to college when my wife bought her 2009 328i, but after a year she took the X3 back and gave our son the 3er. We fully expect to keep it until it hits 200,000 miles- at which point we will probably replace it with a CPO X1."
car_1452,Hard to Hold...,"The steering has a very heavy feeling, not sure if this is common to this vehicle type. The interior has faded, which is to be expected in an older vehicle, but evidently BMW uses different types of material that may have all been the same color when it rolled off the line, but now some elements are totally different colors.  Also, the seats are a bit hard and unsupportive - I expected more in this class of vehicle.  Those things being said, I am happy overall with the vehicle, but I haven't had it that long.Update: I have now had this vehicle for just over a year. In that time I have had to have the fuel pump replaced, the water pump replaced and now my mechanic says it needs $1150 worth of repairs to solve the loud vibrating noise when driving above 20 mph. Evidently it is the drive shaft u-joints, and since it is 4-wheel drive, this will be a complicated fix.  I will have over $13,000 invested in a vehicle that is now worth about half that amount. I am extremely disappointed in this vehicle and will get rid of it as soon as I can."
car_1453,Not a good ownership experience,"I have had my X3 for 10 years and will never purchase another BMW. It started out with having a faulty rim. I then have had 10 window regulators replaced, starting within the first year of ownership. I have also replaced the transfer case and rear differential costing over $6,000. Now the transfer case motor has failed. I have only put 100,000 miles on my car in the 10 years I have owned it. You failed BMW. I will not be a repeat customer."
car_1454,2004 BMW X3 3.0,"This car is amazing! The awd makes it simply impossible to loose control in the rain, the steering is a blast. The 3.0 has plenty of power and gets great gas mileage for an AWD SAV. 6 cd changer, panoramic roof, heated seats, leather, steering controls, navigation, the incredible amount of air bags that are standard! Everyone complaining about the expense is moronic, you're driving a bmw, not a toyota or honda. So far all i had to do was a couple of hoses, tires ect. You do pay more than a rav4 or crv, but then again theres a reason you bought this car! Currently at 134k miles and still drives like new! Driving this baby into the ground"
car_1455,Recently found decent dealership Folsom BMW extrem,"purchased for daughter, needed complete brakes just at 50,000 was not offered extended warranty would have helped, had back latch motor replaced twice, 3rd time was not under warranty, door locks sometimes they do not work? not sure if one needs too push really hard or if it has a ghost, upholstery is cheap, drivers side has tear, this car has not been abused so feel the upholstery is cheap very little storage, very basic is an automatic get very good gas mileage, breaks replaced again at 75,000 go figure, all spark plugs replaced at 80,000 is very expensive to maintain thank god it is dependabledoesn't have issues however just basic maintenance too costly now retired income"
car_1456,Punishing ride.,"I had this car for 6 years. It was solid car with not too many problems. They are 3 times more to fix than on american car though. Key is 173 $ for example. Brakes $756.I bought it on advice from magazine as ""best car in its class"". Not. Is the most expensive car in its class. You can have Lexus RX for the money which is better and bigger car. Or 2 Honda CRVs which any of them will be worth more at trade in in 10 years.This car is shame for BMW. The ride is punishing harsh. The manual transmission is totally not math to engine. Panorama sunroof lets in so much noise. The leather seats have ugly inserts. The car is noisy and full of rattles.I felt like driving the cheap car."
car_1457,Not a bad small SUV,"I bought this car used in 2007 from a used car lot with around 40,000 miles for about 30k currently it has over 94,000. This car has been a dream. It's been in three crashes two head on collisions and a hit and run. All three times the car preformed well (these were mediumspeed crashes so around 30 Mph). the only parts that needed to be replaced was an oil filter and a right front cracked wheel. This car has NO options on it and has a very cheap vinyl upholstery and for the price it is disappointingbut over time it's a good thing because less stuff to go wrong it drives fantastically and still looks good at 10 years but it is overpriced and CAN'T GO OFF ROAD. Would recommend this car"
car_1458,Fun little SUV,"This is my second BMW, i also own a 2008 BMW 128i. When i first drove the X3, being that it is now 8 years old, i expected it to not be very tight. I expexted a little bit of slop in the suspension, leaks, breaking that wasnt as good as it once was.Boy was i surprised, this X3 handles like my 128i and still has a nice stiff ride."
car_1459,Great car with little flaw,"is it just my x? backseat gets wet whenever it rains. 3.0 seems right idea. 6 cd changer would've been nice. overall, tight ride."
car_1460,Everything is going wrong at 60k plus,"I have had the X3 for nearly two years. I am now having all sorts of issue about to have to replace the compressor at 67k already had to replace front brakes need rear brakes now. Have problems with the locking system. Also rear lighter cover wont stay closed. Overall I have enjoyed driving the SUV still with a sports car feel. Wish I would have bought the extended warranty,"
car_1461,Head turner,"We re entry picked up our new RED convertable at the dealer on Friday. I've owned a few Lexus , Mercedes and last 4 were Audis. Not one had  soooo many people stopped to remark how beautiful the car is. It's a big heavy convertable with basically no back seat. Love the warranty and amazed just how little gas she drinks. Plenty of power and lots of gadgets. The executive pkg gave us concierge service for 4 years and 4 years of  service. The heads up information is a great touch. You never need to take your eyes off the road. The kicker is the price tag.. Sticker came is just south of 101k.  Plus tire and wheel insurance of about $2500.  It's my mid-life crisis vehicle . The car I wanted more then any other.  I've been excited every morning to open the garage and see it. It's true I'm not dreaming. Hope I live long enough to pay it off."
car_1462,Best Sport Utility Vehicle Ever Made,"The old (2004)  BMW X3 has the best road feel of any car I have ever driven, that includes, BMW 528, 525i, 540i,  740 iL, GMC Yukon, Jeeps, Cadillac CTS.  The X3  is a great car. One feels the tightness of the four wheel drive under all conditions. Do not believe those who criticize the steering and handling of this car, they are off base.  The  gas mileage is outstanding for continuous four wheel drive."
car_1463,Small BMW SUV a Winner,"I have owned SUVs for 20 years - Jeep, Mercedes, Honda, etc.  This is the best balance between a fun, powerful passing machine and a car to haul things in.  Love it.  Seats a little hard, but very supportive.  No maintenance problems at all.  Great warranty."
car_1464,Fun but only with a warranty folks,"Bought ours used with 84k CPO from a private dealer for $17.5K, we just love the handling & performance. Its like a 3 series but then again an X5, no worries about weather conditions-very safe for the family. Drives/looks like new even with near 100k mileage. Panoramic roof is awesome until the panels didn't close- dealer replaced roof cassette under warranty ($3900 repair) Windshield chips easily ($900 repair) Heated steering wheel & seats are a must. Rain sensing wipers are cool. Please understand the need for a warranty, BMW's are great cars and very reliable (if cared for) but have a maintenance fund/credit card set aside if you purchase w/o warranty"
car_1465,Used purchase,"Was ready to buy either new Rav4 or CRV for wife who requires all wheel drive, but really wanted X3. Found used vehicle at reasonable price with 30K mi. All around better quality (currently own 21 yr old 528e and 33 yr old 2002). Consider to be much better vehicle used than new Rav4 or CRV! X drive is unbelievable!"
car_1466,Great in the snow,"We live in area of heavy snowfall and call this car ""snow leopard"". Its handling in the ice and snow is the best. It is much better in the deep snow than my Toyota Landcruiser."
car_1467,2004 BMW X3 Pros & Cons,"Pros:  this is an awesome SUV with a manual transmission making it fun to drive - zippy!  It's very hard to find american SUVs that are at least 6 cylinder with a stick shift & this one has a 6 speed!  Love that!  Great size for women who think most SUVs are too big and hard to handle.  It's slightly larger than a Toyota RAV4, but well appointed with panoramic sun roof & nice detailing throughout."
car_1468,Not good quality for this model,"Needs a lot of maintenance, on brakes, tires are expensive, the moon roof does not work. It will cost like 2500 to fix, the first gear jumps really bad I scare to drive it now, and the ac compressor went out! Not a smart buy I have 99,500 miles on it."
car_1469,2004 BMW X3,Very fun. Drives wonderfully in the snow and wet. Quiet ride and power.
car_1470,Upholstery Seats,"Bought this vehicle for my wife when it first came out in 2004.  Drives well and is very responsive... just like most BMW's... Have had a good experience overall and not much to complain about.   However, the upholstery (not leather but vinyl fabric?) on the front driver's seat started cracking during the 3rd year of ownership and the fabric was replaced under warranty during the 4th and final year of warranty.  My complaint is that barely a year later, the same cracking is appearing on the same seat.  My wife weighs about 105 lbs and there's only 52,000kms (30,000 miles) on the car!"
car_1471,Best buy,"3.0i with sport package and manual 6-speed. Great car to drive in mountain spins, highway and also in city. Sport pack suspension makes car very fast to drive. Winter driving with studded Nokian HKPL4 is fun and safe. 28 mpg/55 mph, 25 mpg/72 mph highway, and 21 in city, thanks to the manual. Trunk eats 3 person weekend luggages, big emmaljunga & Graco city strollers + hunting staff, everything under cargo space cover same time - I have tried same with volvo xc70 with poor success:-))."
car_1472,Bimmer Family,"My husband bought this car for me for X-mas. I have been driving it for a couple years now and we are very pleased. We have made several long trips in it, in sun, rain and snow and had no problems. We have the six speed manual and the only thing I don't like is that it's so slow in 1st gear, but once into 2nd, it's very zippy and handles great. Even though the gas mileage could be better, we average 22-23 mpg's which I think is great for a 4-wheel drive vehicle. The navigation system is great! It always projects correct travel times."
car_1473,Excellent Drive,It is smooth riding and handles great. We had a 20 inch snowfall last week. This car had no problems. I saw many other SUVs stuck on the side of the road.  Get the heated seats.
car_1474,Not what I was expecting from an SUV!,"I was a bit unsure if I should ever own an SUV, but after driving the X3 I was convinced that you can own an SUV and still feel like driving a sports car. I was impressed by the quickness and sportiness of the X3. Road handling feels like driving a 3 series with a kick! I highly recommend this car for those who want to have the fun of driving a BMW and have some luggage to carry with them. Watch out for gas expense! Premium fuel only??!!"
car_1475,BMW X3,I was very pleased with the reliability of this first model year vehicle. It has a lower profile for an SUV allowing for better turns and sports car handling. I have had no mechanical problems and the included service contract is a plus. The only problem is the lip or running board. It is sometimes difficult to get in and out of the vehicle. I would like it to be thinner. Overall I am very satified with the X3.
car_1476,One of the Best,"This is a wonderful vehicle. Had good experience with Highlander and Lexus RX300. X3 is different animal, performance and handling is awesome no comparison. I've put 60k miles on it with no issues at all. Drove X3 from Virginia to Jersey in heavy rain and absolutely loved the handling and performance. Drove Highlander and Lexus in heavy rain from DC to Jersey. X3 made highlander and Lexus look like a puppy. I'll keep X3 till it dies. I put my life on my cars and get my car maintained by authorized dealerships.Its maintenance cost over all per annum is almost same as Highlander and Lexus. In fact I ended up paying more for the Highlander and Lexus cause I put more miles."
car_1477,Franks car,an absolute pleasure to drive and the navigation system will get you anywhere you want to go. Plenty of power in the engine and response is immediate when needed to make a quick pass.
car_1478,Good but not great.,"Purchased this car to replace a Tahoe for fuel economy. Gets great fuel economy, 2.5l is adequate but wish I had gone with the 3.0l. Excellent stability in poor driving conditions.  Fit and finish is severely lacking. Ash tray lid won't stay closed. Paint chipping on roof rack. Often have issues with door locking system.  Radio seems to delete all preset stations every couple days.  I also have 330i and experience none of these issues. BMW really missed the mark with this car. Feels like a Kia."
car_1479,I'd recommend it,"It's been over 2 years I've been hauling around in this baby SUV, and I'd say it's been a great car.  The styling is excellent, the quality is there, and the XDrive feature has great in heavy rain and at the beach.  It's small enough to park but the interior is surpisingly roomy (I'm 6'5"" and fit just fine).  It's the first car I've ever owned that the seats go back farther than I need them to."
car_1480,Fun to drive - but some problems,"I own the X3 2.5 for 4 years now. Fun to drive and a smart looking crossover.  However Airbag mat (now a official recall) broke 5 times, windows seals have been replaced 3 times and car still CREAKS on every turn and pothole. Steering rack start creaking, too, and was completely replaced.   I do find those problems not acceptable for BMW and will stay away until the get their quality back.  BMW paid for their mistakes: I have bought their extended warranty for about 3000 extra to extend to 100k/6 years and they will fix no matter what without question ask.  Do not get the car without warranty or prepaid service - it´s a money pit !"
car_1481,BMW X3,Nice SUV (SAV).  If I were shopping for a vehical today I would buy it again.  This is the first vehicle I have owned that I can say that about.
car_1482,Airbags Failed to Deploy in Rollover,"Although very happy with my BMW Certified Used X3 the first year I have had it, when the time came for this vehicle to come through with safety features, it failed me. I just had an accident with my 2004 X3 yesterday in which there was a side impact followed by the vehicle rolling over to the left on the driver's side 3 times.  None of my airbags ever deployed in the rollover. My head impacted the vehicle frame 3 times, when in fact in a rollover, my drivers side airbags should have deployed. I just had BMW replace my airbags 9 months ago due to a faulty indication light. The dealership is showing no interest in my complaint."
car_1483,Pleased,This car is well built and lives up to a top quality vehicle for the open road or city life.
car_1484,BMW X3 overview,It is very responsive to the movement of the controls. Acceleration is good. Holds the road well. It is a surpringly nimble car for its size. The breaking is excellent. The interior is spacious. Dash board and instrument readouts are easy to see. I like the orange lighting at night. The exterior sun roof design is beautiful. I enjoy just looking at it.
car_1485,04 X3,"Great handling, fun to drive.  Excellent on curve-y PCH.  Fuel economy is not the greatest but enjoy driving it so much that I don't mind filling up."
car_1486,Got rid of it!,"I think I was just so excited to be able to say that I OWNED a ""BMW"" that I got too caught up in the name. I was so disappointed to find out that only weeks after I purchased the vehicle, it started rattling like a cage! It felt like it was falling apart. I expected alot more from a ""BMW."" I traded that sucker and am now the owner of a Lexus and I couldnt be happier!"
car_1487,Beat Expectations,After reading the review of others which said the suspension and ride of this model year was not up to BMW standards - I was suprised. The car is about as smooth as can be. It is a pleasure to drive. I see no flaws.
car_1488,40.000 mi X3,"The longer we've owned this car, the better we like it.  The biggest drawback is the protruding plastic bits under the doors, everytime you get out you get dirty.  Floor doesn't quite fold flat, but close enough.  We bought snow tires as we do a good deal of winter driving and that made a ton of difference.  The clutch and brakes have remained good, transmission and engine strong.  Ownership drawbacks - high priced gas and oil."
car_1489,Fun SUV,I purchased my X3 the first day I saw it on the lot. I have owned SUVs for eight year and love the elevated feeling they provide but I wanted a 'classy high quality' vehicle. I've found the X3 to be all I've asked of it. My only 'complaint' is the overly stiff ride. I know this is not uncommon with BMWs. Overall it's great and fun to drive.
car_1490,Just Bought a Used 2004,"I've only owned the vehicle for 4 days and I'm quite attached already. The engine is powerful. One caution to first-time BMW drivers, the car uses premium gas. There are plenty of unique features that I'll be reading about for days and learning how to use (rain sensing windshield wipers, self-adjusting headlights, etc.). It does seem a bit utilitarian in the scarcity of luxury-type interior features (where's the built-in sunglass holder and coin rack?). Also, the ride is very springy/bouncy, not as smooth as I expected. Nonetheless, I am smitten at least with the novelty of it all."
car_1491,CA's X3,"This car is our daily driver. It's a pleasure to drive and ride in, very quiet, smooth riding, plenty of power, outstanding brakes. The handling is superb, for a ""sport ute."" I really like the styling both inside and outside. It is a perfect size for our needs. I ski 40 days a year and participate in recreation that requires significant gear another 100  days a year. I think 3 people with gear is the limit for this car. Next ski season, I'll have a roof rack for skis as I don't like skis inside the car. 3 pair is the limit for the ""interior ski bag."" The car pulls our folding trailer, 1,800 lbs, plus camping gear comfortably. Mileage drops to 18.6 from around 21 when towing the trailer."
car_1492,Love my X3,"I have owned my BMW X3 3.0I for over a year and continue to love to drive it as I did when I first drove it off the lot.  It is a ""SAV"" but performs like a sports sedan.  The technology behind the ride quality, performance and safety is truly outstanding.  I am very particular with my cars and I have found nothing wrong with the X3.  In fact I keep finding out new things to love about it.  The service I get at my BMW service center is the best I have ever gotten from any dealership.  BMW knows how to design and build cars that are fun to own.  This is truly one of them."
car_1493,VERY HAPPY,"Love the car, very comfortable to drive and exciting. The sunroof is one of the best features. It's like having a convertible especially for the people in the back. Not as big as my previous SUV, but not as small as others.  I would get another one in a heartbeat!!"
car_1494,great road handler,"This is a great car, it accelerates quickly enough and it follows your intentions effortlessly and its overall dimensions are excellent, it is neither too small nor too big for driving around town or on the freeways. The roof skylight is just awesome because it lets lots of sun in. It is a pleasure to drive."
car_1495,no regrets,"i've been driving it for 1 and 1/2, and like it so much will likely buy it when lease is up. had an initial problem right after delivery - rattling windows. Dealer took care of it, no problems since. I have the faux leather interior which is awesome for my big dogs. Wish the trunk was little roomier and wish they had offered satellite radio at the time of purchase, but otherwise, it's great. Good gas mileage too. Would recommend this to anyone thinking of a crossover vehicle."
car_1496,The 2.5 Manual Has Enough Power,"The 25 liter 6 speed manual trans. offers gear ratio's which are correct for the nenine. I get 20 mpg around town and 27-28 mpg on the road. I have heard complaints about the power.  I live in the Rocky Mountains and have not trouble with power as well as no trouble with passing.  Perhaps, drivers don't like the managing the power with a manual transmission.  It takes deep snow well and will do a good job in mud (we have both).  I replaced the original tires at 20,00 miles with Kelly Navigators; good tires!  The only problem I have had is the seat cover on the drivers side cracking.  It handles so well I think many sedans would be poor by comparison."
car_1497,Closest SUV/Sports Car out there,"After 25,000 miles and almost two years this SAV is a very reliable vehicle.  It really took a full year for me to really appreciate it.  It is a sporty summer fun vehicle with the big sunroof and rips through the ice/snow with ease in the winter.  If you don't want two vehicles this is a great compromise.  It drives almost as sporty as a 3- series and is awesome in the snow.  Add the extra utility and it is truly a winner.  And pretty decent gas mileage too.  I routinely get 21 mpg and drive fairly hard on the gas pedal."
car_1498,X3 could be better,"With 18k miles, this car rattles from a few areas, and there is a water leak soaking the back seat floor. Car handles great and is fun to drive - the 6 speed helps! Overall car is comfortable and handles like a BMW. Quality of materials is a problem."
car_1499,E(X3)ITEMENT!!,"This is a great vehicle.   Build quality is superb and interior finishes are appropriate to the way the its used.   Cargo space is fine for most trips to the home center or warehouse store.   Long trips of 1,000 miles are comfortable and seating doesn't fatigue.    The most noticeable feature is the X- drive.  When in sand or loose gravel this vehicle is superb.  We had a drag race with a Benz G-Wagen while in Mexico and left our 90 thousand dollar friend far behind....  Great vehicle."
car_1500,Sexy X3,"Purchased for European Delivery - family of 5 and luggage. BMW discounts about $2500, buy it from your local dealer. Also save rental exp. I found this site looking for a chip I might add to improve gas mileage. I get a horrible 13.8MPG in the city driving softly. Other issues: 1) at 75 MPH a high pitched noise is induced. Got to drive faster or slower to avoid it. 2) The rear hatch often doesn't shut completely. Interior light remains on. Need to really slam it. 3) Order the back-up warning system because the rear window is so high you can't see the hood of the car your backing into. 4) Stearing wheel blocks the speedometer. Regardless great car. Hope MPG can be fixed."
car_1501,Me & My X-3,"The X-3 is a very tight riding, solid European car.  The exterior styling is beautiful.  It handles very well in snow.  The moon roof feels like a convertible when opened fully.  Gas mileage could be better, but I've used regular gas without any problems.  I do not feel the 2.5L engine is underpowered.  The interior I have is leatherette and somewhat plain, but spills wipe off easily.  The A/C could be a little better.  I wish it had a center console.  Overall,  I'm very happy with my X-3!!"
car_1502,perfect combination,"I've owned Porsche, several SUVs,, Chevys, Jeep, Subaru.  Looked at the Beamer cause I loved my BMW K100 motorcycle.  Since it is a little pricey, (not overpriced) looked at company cars with less than 9k miles.  Also drove Mercedes, Lexus, Audi Toyota etc.  Wanted performance AND 4X versatility.  Got both in spades.  Handles better than some sports cars.  Heated leather seats and all the bells and whistles you could hope for."
car_1503,Finally performance and utility,"The X3 is an excellent compromise between perfomance and utility.  I never feel as though I am driving a truck, yet when required, she will haul kids, boats, dogs, and the occational load of straw.  I fit 6 bails of straw with the rear door closed easily.  No need to worry about keeping it clean because it's a truck.  Actually the quality materials allow for quick and easiy clean-up.  This vehical is top notch and as motivated me to trade-in my MB c-class for the new 3 series."
car_1504,The Truth about the E83,"This is in response to the many people including Edmunds who claim that the interior is ""cheap"" and the ride is rough. Subjective tripe! If you bought this vehicle and have regrets, I have no sympathy for you. You didn't do your homework. Let me help. THIS IS NOT, NOR WAS IT INTENDED TO BE, AN ELEVATED 330xi! It is a completely unique vehicle by BMW. You will not find a soft, glossy interior. Instead, you are greeted by a rugged dash and a somewhat different look and feel than any other BMW, though there are similarities. It Seems to be very well built. The car follows the road. Rough road=Rough ride! Control is amazing. In short, I can't imagine a car more practical, capable or exciting!"
car_1505,Aaah!.. Now I Get It!,"I've owned Toyotas and Hondas for years for the reliability and resale value. Forget it! What good is a reliable car that you don't enjoy driving? The BMW is what you want. It's the closest thing to perfect I've ever seen or owned. The handling is AMAZING! The engineering is first class, and I've owned everything from Ford to Fiat. Ride is not rough, it simply follows the road. It does exactly what you tell it to. I HIGHLY recommend the X3 for the active person or small family. The CPO program is perfect; saved $10,000 over new and still have 3 years factory warranty- plus 2 years CPO warranty! AMAZING! WHY would anyone buy anything other than a BMW? Something to ponder."
car_1506,Best 'Car-like' Luxury SUV,"I hate SUVs. Needed more space, and didn't want a wagon, so looked at the X3, and haven't looked back. Closest thing to a car ride. Have bad backs, and dual lumbar support in front seats are THE BEST compared to other cars. Suspension is a little tight, though not as bad on mine w/o the sport package. Base sound system so/so only. Panoramic sunroof amazing. Backseat comfort very good - spacious, especially with sunroof. Fuel economy is my biggest gripe:  average 16 MPG in mostly city driving (with a heavy foot). Overall value was great with end of year deals -  probably wouldn't have justified cost otherwise. Got Aux. audio jack:  Works great with iPod (don't think iPod jack is worth it)!"
car_1507,Consistency,"I have owned BMWs since 1984. The X-3 is an excellent example of the BMW experience. It provides a solid ride, fun and is very functional. I bought it for winter driving. It is excellent in all conditions. It is fun and responsive whether driving on the highway or in NYC.The X3 is a good cross over between the X5 and the 3 series. I'm very pleased with it."
car_1508,Good or Bad,"We had a MB C230 coupe & loved it so much for a hatchback cargo space, the ride & of course the panoramic roof except rear wheel drive in snowy winter...It was time to change & get a BMW X3, more cargo space & more secure in winter driving. It's so grip on snow & no problem of getting out of driveway with fresh snow. It corners better than a car but a little bumpy on aged asphalt, which I think it's due to low profile tires."
car_1509,The Fun Driving Machine,"The X3 is so much fun to drive! It handles like a sports car. It's quiet at highway speeds. Great brakes! It has a fantastic sunroof that extends to the rear seats that brings extra light into the vehicle, as well as a sense of added interior space. The xDrive works great on wet and snowy roads. The automatic transmission with the 5-speed Steptronic shifter is really fun on a twisty road. The 2.5 liter six cylinder engine provides the X3 with plenty of power. The leather seats are supportive and very comfortable. For someone who does not like monster sized SUV's, but likes great comfort, safety and AWD performance, the X3 is the perfect vehicle for any road."
car_1510,EXTREMELY ROUGH SUSPENSION,"Purchased black X3 3.0 6speed with active xenon lights and Panorama roof.  Looking back, the 25 min test drive was on all smooth asphalt surfaces where the salesman directed me to go.  After driving home over patchy concrete and highway expansion joints I became worried.  The suspension was unbelievably stiff.  Yes the X3 handled spectacular, but at a huge price of feeling every irregularity in the road directly to your back.  Every single person who rode in my X3 commented within 10 mins how rough it rode (and I had normal suspension, the non-sport package).  Got to the point where I started seeing a chiropracter.  I called it quits and traded it in after 5 months of ownership."
car_1511,wowilovethe X3!,"Well I got this car in June, for my 
16th birthday. i liked the X5 but my 
parents thought it was too big so I 
got this. When I saw it online I was 
thinking wow, with these options and 
5,000.00 more you could have an 
Escalade. Well the dealers incentives 
are pretty good so then I got the car. 
It is black with grey leather and has 
the Sport pckg., Prem pckg., Prem. 
Snd, xenon lights, cold weather 
package, and steptronic plus 
navigation. WOW I am so impressed. It 
has adequate power for what I need and 
feels very safe. It takes corners 50-
55mph like a dime. It seems small on 
the outside but the inside is great. 
Spending the summer in this car was 
awesome! we just had a winter snow 
storm, was great"
car_1512,"First BMW ... a bit pricy, but solid","After driving an A4 for several years, was in the market for a vehicle with more space, but still fun to drive.  The X3 has filled both needs, but thus far it feels like it was $10K too expensive (mid $40Ks) -- after adding reasonable equipment to the 3.0 package.  In hindsight, wonder why I did not buy an X5?  Ultimately, extra cost up-front vs. vehicles in its class will need to gauged vs. long-term reliability."
car_1513,"Nice, but .............","I originally started looking at the Cadillac SRX, but didn't like their bundled options and price. I love the styling and performance of the BMW, but there is a lot of room for improvement. The ride is a bit stiff.  Acceleration and handling are great making this vehicle fun to drive. This is my first SUV and I couldn't believe the poor gas mileage, on premium fuel! Next, the front door seals protrude into the doorways, making them susceptible to damage during entry/ exit. And the cargo area is poorly lit by a light on the tailgate.  If you slam the tailgate too hard, the bulb pops out of its socket! I wish they would pay more attention to the details. Nice, but not worth the $43k price tag."
car_1514,BMW X3 3.0i,"The handling is great for this car.  
Xdrive is impressive. Though fuel 
consumption is high and the gearbox 
seems to be stucked at 3000rpm.  I'm 
not sure whether it is just my car but 
the automatic transmission from gear 3 
to gear 4 is not smooth and it stucks 
in gear3.  But overall, the car is a 
great impressive car with excellent 
handling in winter condition."
car_1515,BMW's Super SUV,"I owened a BMW 325 ci before I got my 
X3. I never thought I would be getting 
into a SUV, at least not for a while. 
Although, this car is incredible. It 
does everything you ask it to do, and 
then some!!  The handling on the car is 
superb! I would even say better than my 
previous sportpackage coupe. Also, 
another plus is it's enormous moonroof. 
A must have!!!  The car is so great 
that my mom and sister had to get one."
car_1516,Best of Both Worlds,"The X3 is the best of both worlds, 
small and nimble and drives like a car, 
yet big enough to be practical and has 
one great all-wheel drive system.  It 
is, by far, the best driving SUV I've 
ever driven.  Couldn't be happier with 
my purchase."
car_1517,Okke's review,"Great lively car to drive.  It has lots
of features but that makes the car a bit
too expensive.  Car looks smaller than
it actually is, which for some people
may be a disadvantage.  Very easy to
drive and handles more like a sportscar
than a SUV.  BMW calls it a SAV for that
reason I suppose."
car_1518,BMW X3,"Experiencing a BMW for the first time, 
I was impressed. The sound and feel of 
the engine, the firm handling, and 
general ambiance of the vehicle. 
Taking it out on the streets is a 
thrill, taking it out on the freeway 
is relaxing. Those who say the ride 
feels too ""harsh,"" thats 
understandable seeing what the 
philosophy of BMW is, to provide firm 
handling, no matter what. In terms of 
versatility, it is perfect for a 
suburban setting; not too big and not 
too small. From a design point of 
view, the whole package is refreshing 
when many designs these days 
are ""cookie-cutters"" and do not have a 
design philosophy behind it. To sum up 
the BMW X3, simply great."
car_1519,"What happened to the ""MDX""",I had my heart set in the Acura MDX until I drove the BMW X3 3.0.  The car is so much fun to drive and stands apart from the other automobiles on the road. With a powerful engine and great cornering ability it's hard for people to keep up with you.  So far so good.  I can't wait to drive on a long road trip!!
car_1520,Bring on the winter!,"Coming off a Z3, I expected to be 
disappointed with the SUV experience.  
I was wrong.  The X3 is fun to drive 
and handles incredibly.  The interior 
is luxurious (more so than the Z3) and 
the features and options are just pure 
BMW.  No words can describe the 
panoramic moon roof! This truly is the 
ultimate driving machine.  Bring on the 
winter!"
car_1521,From SAAB to X3,"Okay, it was time to dump my great 2000 
SAAB 9/5 loaded wagon before the 
warranty ran out. I looked all summer 
at Jeep, Suburu and Mazda 6 deals and 
then saw the sign and drive ad for the 
X3. The dealership had a black on black
""basic"" X3 and with one test drive, I 
reached for my wallet. What a great
vehicle.  It handles like a sports car,
gets great mileage and I don't miss 
the ""loaded"" features I was used to.
The six speed is awesome and of course,
the ""six"" has no turbo, thus no ""lag"".
The only strange thing is not to have
cruise control as standard equipment.
My buddy says I'll be paying for that
.....in fines. It is very smooth and 
quiet at high speeds."
car_1522,love this SUV,"We have owned various Jeep Grand 
Cherokees, and the Lexus RX 300.  By 
far, the BMW is the superior car.  I 
have no idea what reviewers are talking 
about-  we got ours for the low 30's, 
not the mid 40's, and love the vehicle. 
We specifically got it with just black 
interior-  no silly wood, very 
teutonic, and love it.  The ride is 
superb, stiff-  not like a caddy, 
fortunately...  It is undeniably the 
best SUV on the road for us.  To test 
drive one is to love one."
car_1523,A great car from BMW,"The X3 is a great SUV for people that
want the SUV flexibility but a car-like
ride. The X3 is very roomy altough it
does not look like a behemoth on the
road (like the new SUVs from Nissan,
Cadillac, etc.) The external style is
very sport but elegant at the same time.
Interior finish is high quality. The
ride may feel a bt stiff on very bumpy
roads, but when you ride on winding
roads or on the highway you can really
enjoy the sporty ride. BMW aced this
car. I used to drive an X5 and, although
the X5 is more luxurios, the X3 has
nothing to envy at all to the X5
(interior room is better in the X3, in
particular in the back seats."
car_1524,An die Freude!,"When they say ""Ultimate Driving 
Machine"" they ain't just 
whistling ""Beer Barrel Polka""!  I was 
almost dissuaded from buying the X3 by 
a partially negative review. So glad I 
dismissed it.  Took my new X3 from the 
showroom on an 800 + mile trek, loving 
every minute!  The vehicle performed 
flawlessly.  Stopped once for 
breakfast, a few times to gas up...I 
don't let it go below 1/2 a tank...a 
couple of stretch breaks.  Arrived 12 
hours later with my usually painful 
back feeling great. I expect the 
return trip to be every bit as 
enjoyable."
car_1525,Buyer be careful,"My loves her new car. We upraded to a 
VW from Hondas and now we were getting 
our first SUV the cute BMW X3. We test 
drove the 2.5 & 3.0 & did not notice a 
major difference. Both cars had an arm 
rest cruise etc, standard in all our 
other cars. We wanted a white car. We 
got a white car at what I thought was 
a hell of a deal.My wife drove her new 
car home.The next morning my daughter 
came to see the new car. Dad 
where is the arm rest, where is --- 
the list went on. I called the dealer 
said that what we got was not what 
we test drove. Basically was told you 
should of read the window sticker.
Warning  first time BMW buyers read 
the sticker, nothing is std on an X3"
car_1526,Great SUV,"My  husband and I were looking around 
for a new suv for both of us. We test 
drove many SUVs.
After driving the X3, we were sold.
We purchased two X3's August 2004, one 
black and the other silver. 
Unfortunately, after 3 weeks, I was T-
boned by a toyota on the passengers 
side.The other vehicle's whole front 
end was demolished. My X3 stood the 
test. I was protected by its well built 
solid body and I was not harmed."
car_1527,Euro Delivery,"Ordered a 2005 and took delivery in
Munich on 11 Oct. We spent a week
driving through Germany on and off the
Autobahns and what a Blast! I love the 6
speed and panoramic roof. Up and down
through the Black Forest and along the
Rhine for a truly fun time. The last
instruction from the delivery center was
to keep it under 100 mph and 4500 rpm
which was a challenge but even at that,
I averaged 20+ mpg.

I can't wait for the car to make it from
Munich back across the Atlantic. I need
to some reprogramming of the automatic
adjustments for the seat, mirrors, theft
alarm, lights, etc. but that's secondary
to the pure fun of driving this nice
little piece of German engineering."
car_1528,X3   3.0   the best,"awsome ride!
fast.
responsive, excellent handling.
good looks.
more like a sports car than an SUV.
BMW makes an excellent engine!
highly reccomended.
the price is right."
car_1529,X3 Fun,"BMW has a real winner in the new X3. A 
slightly smaller version of the X5. 
Great gas mileage,plenty of cargo 
room,comfortable and all the luxury of 
a BMW expected.The cuurent warranty of 
4 years 60,000 miles down to the tires 
is a real key in and drive no stress 
(free tow) if there is a problem BMW 
grand perk. The mileage counter onboard 
tells you when service is due based on 
your driving habits,counting down from 
15,000 miles ! No more shop visits 
every 3-4000 miles ! The suspension is 
a bit stiffer than my last 328i but 
that is to be expected with this 
versatile SAV that is multi-functional 
with equal gas mileage.I will always 
own a BMW SAV in the future."
car_1530,x3- good deal,"This is a great value for anyone 
wanting higher ride than a sedan, a 
Euro import and fun car. Have had mine 
for a month and with the exception of 
a belt that needs to be tightened all 
is well (knock wood. Spend time with 
your salesman though... there are may 
variatons of the X3 and it wasn't 
until after delivery that I realized 
there were options I would have liked. 
On the other hand, do you need radio 
controls on the wheel, fog lights etc. 
I saved some $$$. Buy this car if you 
want this size suv... hands down it's 
best deal out there"
car_1531,"Puts the ""U"" in SUV","Was looking for an AWD vehicle that 
had comfortable seats for long drives 
to Yosemite and Lake Tahoe.  
Aggressive (high residual) factory 
financing from BMW lease promotion 
made this the logical choice over the 
325xi sedan or wagon, or competitors' 
vehicles (yes, it's a minivan more 
than it is a sports car).  Interior 
materials are better than what should 
be expected in a ""utility"" vehicle.  
Pretty quiet at highway speeds.  
Looking forward to testing in the snow 
this winter.  My X3 replaced a Jeep 
Cherokee; I don't expect the X3 to go 
off-road.  But with all maintenance 
covered for 4 years, I don't expect 
unforseen maintenance expenses, either."
car_1532,Love my new X3 - 3.0,"I just picked up my X3 from Sonnen 
BMW.  The car is perfect.  It’s mystic 
blue, 3.0 automatic with navigation, 
xenon, park distance control, premium 
and sport packages, premium sound.  
Handles better than any other SUV I’ve 
tried and very similar to my 2001 
330i.  Really looking forward to 
taking it in the Tahoe snow this 
winter."
car_1533,Love it so; But I wish..........,"My girlfriend and I recentley 
purchased an 04 X3 2.5i Auto.. We have 
had so much fun in our X3 and we have 
only had it for a couple months. This 
vehicle can do anything you want, and 
then some! We love driving it, even 
rock, paper, scissoring to see who 
will drive. Overall we are in line 
with most reviews you will read. It's 
a great vehicle, but watch that bottom 
line. Although from most measurables 
the majority of X3's look and perform 
very similar or the same, the prices 
are very very different."
car_1534,This is an awesome car,"I am thrilled with this car.  I 
purchased a 2.5 6speed manual which 
handles beautifully.  There is plenty 
of power, and top notch performance.  
There is plenty of room for childrens 
car seats and the extras in back."
car_1535,New Owner,"this is a fun vehicle that has a smooth 
ride.  The interior is superub with an 
oustanding speaker system."
car_1536,Great Car,"The X3 does everything perfectly and i 
love it."
car_1537,I fell in love...,"There is really nothing I could want from my X3, 
that it does not offer.  It handles roads amazingly, 
feels light like a feather in comparison to my mom's 
X5...  

As usual the BMW in-line 6 reigns supreme.  The 
power is very good with the 3.0, and can take out 
any Lexus's or other wannabe SAV's (they will try 
and challenge you..) easily...

The NAV is great...  Its pre-iDrive but still very very 
good by german standards (which are pretty low 
since we have MB & Porsche horrific nav's)...  Its 
great how it rememebers its previous position and 
flips up or down when you start the car..."
car_1538,An Excellent Ride,"My experience with this vehicle has 
been outstanding. It is a SAV that 
drives and feels like a car. It has 
exceptional performance, manuevering 
capability and load of safety features. 
You just cannot go wrong with this 
vehicle."
car_1539,Satisfied,"I am enjoying my new X3. I like that I 
can go anywhere with my new X3. It is 
agile enough to manover in the city and 
ruged enough to go off road into the 
mountains. 

Very Satisfied, Thanks BMW for a great 
vehicle."
car_1540,Fair Warning....,"Although we generally like the 
vehicle's ride, handling, and the 
sporty design, the constant trips to 
the dealer (once a month for each 
month we've owned it) for fixing of 
constant defects clearly make this 
$45k car a waste of time money."
car_1541,BMW X3,"First BMW. We had a Toyota 4runner.  
The X3 is the perfect size car for my 
wife. Love the sunroof. fair gas 
mileage of about 27 on first trip. The 
car handles great.  Fit and finish is 
very good...I can't find any rough 
spots yet or defects..except for the 
the transmission computer failure which 
was replaced in two days and they gave 
us a loaded 525 to drive. Lucky it kept 
running until we got it to the garage."
car_1542,Happiness is driving a X3,"Fun to drive SUV. Excellent handling 
under any weather conditions."
car_1543,Alternator,"Well, we have had the x3 for 3 weeks 
now and we have already had the 
alternator replaced. I am not sure 
what is to come but outside of that 
minor problem BMW totally took care 
us. This was purchased moreso for my 
wife and I look forward to weekends 
when I get my turn behind the wheel. 
It handles very well and if you cant 
seem to get the finances together for 
an x5 this is the way to go! I am a 
die hard Subaru fan and I cannot wait 
to see what this car does in the dead 
of winter up in our mountain area. The 
all wheel drive was a huge selling 
factor along with the overall inside 
safety features."
car_1544,Quite a Surprise,"As soon as I test drove this vehicle I 
was hooked.  The vehicle has plenty of 
pick-up, is very comfortable and 
visibility from the driver's seat is 
very good.  I've read alot of reviews 
on this car and many of them complain 
about the ride but my experience, so 
far, is that the ride is just right.  
After all it's a BMW - my '01 3 touring 
rides just like it."
car_1545,Love the X3,"Had the X3 for a few months now. Zero 
problems/squeaks/rattles. Trans, cup 
holders, hatch, moonroof, AC, 
everything all work perfectly; a few of 
you guys must have gotten bad ones. 
Bought it to go up to the mountains in 
the winter; enjoy the incredible 
handling, brakes, visiblity, 
smoothness, stereo the rest of the 
year. Fits in the garage easily. Very 
comfofrtable to drive for long periods."
car_1546,FIRST TIME BEEMER OWNER,"I just traded in a toyota corolla for 
my first BMW. I previously owned a Ford 
Explorer Sport. The ride is amazing. 
MPG isn't so bad - appx 20mpg. 
Definitely worth owning. Dealership was 
very helpful."
car_1547,AWESOME,"Fashion Interior/Exterior Design 
+ the ""BMW"" Performance. 
You not gonna pass this one ~"
car_1548,Great Car!!,"My friend has a 2002 330 ci 
convertable, and after driving my new 
X3 asked if the dealer had any more 
outfitted the same! (I had to pry him 
out of the driver's seat. Love the 
performance and features. Much nicer 
size and performance than X5, retains 
the 3.0 liter 3 series performance. 
Easy to forget it's a SUV when 
driving. Great $$program thru BMW 
financial."
car_1549,AWESOME,"Fashion Interior/Exterior Design 
+ the ""BMW"" Performance. 
You not gonna pass this one ~"
car_1550,Squeaks Like a 2 Horse Wagon,"I bought the X3 to replace an aging 
328i, which stayed in the shop most of 
the time. Unfortunately, after a week 
the squeaks and rattles in the X3 were 
so bad, I had the dealer pick up the 
car.  Now, 2 weeks later I still don't 
have it back because the dealer is 
waiting for some kind of part from 
Germany.  To be fair, they have given 
me a loaner, but that is not the 
point.  I wish I had bought the 
4Runner."
car_1551,BMW  X3.25i Really is the Ultimate,"The car drives like a dream. However, 
the cabin interior makes creaking 
noises at slow speeds (5-10 mph), and 
you can hear the wind blowing at higher 
speeds (40 mph +)."
car_1552,what a car,"Bmw hit it big this time with a fun to 
drive, responsive felling SAV. The X3 
is beautifully designed and has all the 
toys car buyers love this days.It's 
technology,although many times 
invisible (Xdrive,Dynamic stability 
control)gives the driver a sense of 
security and control. A great 
alternative to monster sized SUVs. This 
is a size conscious,performance driven 
family car."
car_1553,Excellent SUV,"This is a great value for the money. It
may not be as comfortable as my old
Grand Cherokee, but it drives 100 %
better. Its handling is what you would
expect from a BMW. I am very happy. The
lease price was much less than SUVs with
far less ratings."
car_1554,Got Much more than what I expected,"I Recently purchased an X3 2.5i not nowing exactly 
if I bought it because it was a BMW or because it 
was a car that made sense for me. After a month 
driving it I relize that I got a lot more than what I 
expected. I was scared of criticism of a very 
stiff suspension but is not an issue at all. It is not 
soft but if that's what you want you don't want a 
BMW. The standar features make sure that your 
driving experience is pleasant, fun and safe 
including all kind of airbags, ABS, DSC, etc. Yeah if 
you want leather and other gimmicks are extra. But 
your basic driving needs are covered."
car_1555,New to SAV,"I just recently purchased my SAV and 
like it very much.  It takes a little 
getting used to to sit up higher than 
my previous sedan.  This vehicle is 
very comfortable and the instrument 
panel is typical BMW.  The driver is 
the main ingredient with their design.

Mileage should improve with age and 
more prudent driving.

The exterior is awesome in its design 
and the Silver Grey Metallic paint is 
flawless.  This should be a keeper for 
some time."
car_1556,BMW X3 2.5i,"Amazingly fun to drive. excellent compromise 
between exterior size and interior room"
car_1557,X3 Fun Machine,"great, fun to drive car. Handles great"
car_1558,This car is GRREEAT!!,"I just bought my X3, and it's 
wonderful!! I love the way it drives, 
it doesn't drive like an SUV at all.  
The car hugs the road, so you feel safe 
in it. Great price for such an all 
around beautiful car"
car_1559,X3 Enthusiast,"We have owned our new X3 SAV for almost two
months and have logged 4300 miles on this 3.0 6-
speed manual.  This new introduction into the BMW 
line-up has more than lived up to our expectations.  
The X3 is based along BMW's 3-series and stays 
true to form in its ability to provide a more sports-
car like feel to a SUV body.  The X3 provides 
excellent braking, is very agile, nimble, and 
responsive.  The 6-speed manual reinforces BMW's 
reputation behind their manual transmisions.  To 
those buyers who are looking for an SUV that will 
offer better handling characteristics, braking and 
overall performance .. X3 owners will be favorably 
impressed with BMW's new introduction."
car_1560,BMW does it again!!!,"I love everything about this truck. 
From its tight-handling to its 
panoramic sun-roof!! It drives like a 
dream....like a 325 on stilts. This is 
what separates this sporty SAV from 
the rest of the SUV pack. 

The interior is typical BMW - 
functional and not too flashy. There 
is enough room for a family of 4 with 
all their gear. 

It's not the most spacious, nor the 
most powerful, nor is it the most 
brutish SUV on the road. This is the 
perfect SUV for those who plan to 
drive (like most of us!) most of the 
time in the city."
car_1561,Great Handeling,"The 2.5L engine seems to be a little 
under powered for the wieght of this 
car.  The handeling is by far the best 
out of any SUV on the market.  
This car seems to be way over priced 
for what it is.  If it wasn't for such 
a great lease, the car wouldn't be 
worth it if I had purchased it.  
What your buying from the X3 is BMW's 
great handeling engineering."
car_1562,John B Review,"This is a superb car-like SUV. It 
handles like a 5 series auto, but has 
the advantages of an SUV."
car_1563,"Nice vehicle, but not worth the +$40k","I just love the way the X3 handles and 
its compact young look. It is fairly 
spacious inside and provides a sporty, 
if sometimes somewhat rough ride."
car_1564,Great Car!,"This car drives like a 325 ro 525 with 
the benefits of an SUV - great car!!"
car_1565,If it's what you want,"3.0 engine rocks. Much better than 2.4. 
Not your standard luxury SUV-not 
bloated or soft. Cat-quick, great 
handling. Tranny smooth as butter. 
Interior materials superior. No junk. 
Tasteful. Sport setting on transmission 
works best. Seats wonderful. Only SUV 
my wife (4'11) and I (6'3) can both 
actually drive comfortably. Leather 
nubby but I like it. Stiff suspension 
but only feel it on really rough roads. 
On the highway it runs like a dream. 
It's like driving a sedan with a very 
large trunk. Had no intention of buying 
a BMW but after driving them all fell 
in love with it. Deserves a long look 
and long test drive."
car_1566,This Vehicle Is Superb!,"This vehicle is a perfect mix of class 
and sport.  After reading Car & 
Driver's scathing review, I was 
apprehensive but this car drives great -
 smooth, comfortable, and intune with 
the road. 2.5 liters is all you need! 
BMW has really hit the ground running 
with this one."
car_1567,I wish I bought the XC90,"Good car with great handling. A little 
stiff though."
car_1568,x3,"I love this car it is a great machine
the car handles like a champ. It is the
ultimate driving machine."
car_1569,Spec,"no problems so far, some doors noise & 
airconditioning on when starting the X3 but 
otherwise fine"
car_1570,My best ever car,"One of the best cars to drive in the 
Greek roads.
I have a  package of three cars in one!
One limousine for driving in the town.
One safe and fast car for driving in 
the highways.
One offroad for havig fun everywhere."
car_1571,STICKS LIKE GLUE TO THE ROAD,"Traded my 525 I for this 3.0 X3. Very 
roomy inside great visability cruises 
at 80 mph without feeling  the road. 
Eats thru wet roads look forward to the 
snow season.Great Brakes. The ulitmate 
driving machine. You won't be 
disapointed."
car_1572,"BMW X-3, 2.5","the X3 is a dream to drive.  More like 
a sports car than a ""truck.""  Plenty of 
power, 6-gears and lots of features.  
The full time 4-wheel drive gives a 
real feeling of holding the road in all 
conditions.  I live (and drive) in 
Germany and the X3 is great on all 
roads, autobahn or winding back paths. 
My 5th BMW but first SAV.  It won't be 
my last."
car_1573,It's a NICE RIDE!,"I love it, personally. It drives like a 
car, but has the four-wheel drive 
capabilities of an SUV. Yes, they say 
it doesn't do too well in off-roading, 
but I am not about to hit any desert 
dunes any time soon. The sound system 
is also incredible, it comes standard 
with 10 speakers. The peppy engine, 
comfortable leather seats, and the 
awesome sound system make for an 
incredible driving experience. Highly 
recommend it."
car_1574,PERFECT,"I HAVE OWNED ALOT OF VEHICLES BUT THIS 
ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST IN PERFORMANCE, 
COMFORT AND LOOKS. BMW HAS A GREAT ONE 
IN THIS SUV. THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR 
LOOK IS EXCELLENT. I LOVE THIS ONE!"
car_1575,Interesting package,"My X3 2.5 got all options but premium
sound, 10-way seats and heated steering.
After reading reviews, I was afraid of
the build problems, but my car got
almost none. Reflex LCD Nav unit and
sunroof are great. Interior material
quality is fine (same as Z4). Engine is
ok for everyday drive, would feel better
w/manual. So 3.0 is not really needed,
unless you think you can race an SUV. I
mostly miss alarm, premium sound and
lumbar support. Also do not expect much
in electronics dept, as Austria is far
behind Japan for things like MP3 and
bluetooth. Also, typical to BMW, most
necessities (i.e. all-weather mats) are
 not standard."
car_1576,X3 X-cellent,"Just purchased the X3, and couldnt be 
more pleased.  I believe that BMW may 
have some future design changes, but 
the ultimate perk to the X3 or any BMW 
is the service plan.  You may pay the 
higher price, and compromise the 
luxury, but you wont have to do a thing 
for the life of the car. BMW takes good 
care of its owners."
car_1577,Great Car,"Overall, love the vehicle.  The safety 
features are incredible.  After driving 
a Jeep cherokee with nothing for safety 
this is great.   Weird quirk-can't open 
the rear hatch from inside car; must 
use key.  The xenon lights are amazing 
and truly increase visibility at nite.  
The dash area wouldn't win any beauty 
contests, its a bit rustic."
car_1578,Happy,"Compared to my last car, Freelander 
HSE, the X3 is a dream.  A quiet ride 
for the most part.  A few distant 
squeaks associated with the panaromic 
moonroof.  The cargo area is a good 
size for a small SUV."
car_1579,"Nice, fun...","I just purchased this SUV 4 days ago 
and I love it!! I love it inside and 
out! This vehicle it very solid."
car_1580,Much more fun than X5!,"This vehicle feels roomier than the 
first generation of X5's, has a better 
sunroof, and it's definitely got a nice 
price. The drive is beyond amazing and 
there are no blind spots whatsoever. My 
only issue is that at low speeds, the 
entire vehicle creaks whenever I make a 
turn. Maybe it's an SUV/4WD thing. 
After 6 great years with Audi, it was 
tough to leave, but they are currently 
lacking an SUV in their line-up. I love 
my X3-what a great introduction to BMW!"
car_1581,My birthday present,"I purchased this car the X3, about a 
month ago.  What a pleasure to drive.

In a previous life, I was 
manufacturer's rep and put on 100k 
miles/2years.  I spend alot of time in 
the car.

I feel very secure and safe driving in 
the crazy Atlanta traffic,"
car_1582,Love my 428I,Great car. Fun to drive. The cars feels like its part of you. Not the most comfortable car for a passenger though

car_1585,"Great Car, LOUSY Company","The car itself is fantastic.  Bought the six-cylinder version not because of the added power but because there is no comparison in smoothness.  Incredibly smooth power with great brakes and handling.  Nice styling and finishing, as one should expect.  Beautiful, comfortable interior although the leather in the driver's seat developed a wrinkle across the back TWICE until BMW finally had an upholsterer add additional attachments (I'm 6-4 and 190, so it's not my weight).  Stereo, navigation, and bluetooth work easily for me, although it would be better yet if you could get both the birdseye view and the rearview camera view on the same screen.What ruins the situation is the LOUSY manner in which BMW treated me over a $100 repair.  One (1) wheel developed black spots that leached through the paint and left streaks.  The other three wheels were/are perfect because I am obsessive about cleanliness.  The dealer tried to remove the spots with solvent and instead removed the silver paint and left the black spots.  They referred me to the Regional Representative, who declared the spots to be ""probably tar,"" not even ""definitely tar"" -- how can they say that when solvent takes off the paint and leaves the spots, and there's not a spot of tar on any of the other three wheels?  And to make matters worse, I waited a month for that appointment and then sat there for two hours to discuss the problem, and he totally blew me off.  Upon learning what he had written on the repair order, the dealer offered to goodwill half of the $100 repair bill.  I refused because it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing.  It's bad paint, cover it under the *(&^ warranty!  I then elevated this to BMW NA, where things went from bad to worse.  They ignored my complaint for weeks, didn't return phone calls, and didn't respond to followup e-mails.  Finally a ""Resolution Specialist"" rudely told me that they didn't know what caused the problem, but it wasn't covered by the warranty.  So I asked him -- do you mean all everyone from BMW that I've spoken to so far have been WASTING MY TIME when it wasn't even covered by the warranty?  He said yes.  He couldn't tell me where it said this in the warranty book (paint defects are not excluded, road damage is), so I wrote a letter to the President of BMW NA.  A lady responded and looked into it, but the result was that they would ""goodwill"" the entire repair.  This is better but I'm not satisfied because they still won't tell me why it's not covered under the warranty, and there has been no apology for the bad information, wasting my time (if it's really not covered), or the delays or misinformation.  Oh, for my ""goodwill"" the repair -- I was told to speak to a specific person at the dealer -- who has thus far refused to return my phone call for four days.  BMW, if you're listening, your car is great but I'll never buy another because of the way you treat your customer over a $100 repair.  You lose my business forever to save yourself a $100 repair -- that's sure a funny way to do business."
car_1586,"I haven't had it too long, but no complaints!","I have owned several BMW's in the past and the 4-series first attracted me due to its aesthetics.  I figured that it wouldn't perform to my ultimate expectations, however ended up giving it a test drive, the AWD X-Drive handles GREAT.  The interior is beautiful, fully loaded and has all the cool things (GPS, Bluetooth, Premium Leather, ETC) that would would expect in a BMW."
car_1587,"Great car - but I dislike ""I-Drive"" electronics","This is my 2nd BMW coupe.  I had a fabulous 328i which I drove for 16 years with almost no failures/repairs.  My 3-year old 435i with 2WD and 6-speed manual is fun to drive, comfortable, great looking and overall a pretty good car.  with just miles my car has been back to the dealer twice for repairs.  The ""computer"" that controls the fancy electronic dashboard needed to be replaced because if could no longer connect via the AT&T 2G network - which no longer exists.  And then just a week later, that new control unit failed and needed to be replaced again. Despite being advertised as getting just 25-28 mpg, I am finding that I get about 28 mpg in the city, and 32 mpg on the highway (driving at a steady 79 mph).  The manual transmission clearly helps me on gas mileage.However:  the BMW I-drive controls for the audio system are pretty sad. When getting back into the car, the display screen will never be the same as previous.  This means you will always have to press buttons to return to the display you want to see.  (I wonder how long before those buttons wear out...... Probably just after warranty expires!)  And every time you use the car you will need to turn up the audio volume again.  Stupid.stupid.stupid.   But worst of all is that the logic behind the operation of the audio..... Well, it just defies all intuitive logic!As much as I love manual transmissions, I doubt that I will buy another BMW with this crummy electronic control system.Another complaint:  Run-flat tires.  These are noisy, harsh-riding, expensive, and are already more than half worn-out after just 14000 miles.   I intend to replace them with standard type tires.   Then I'll buy an emergency inflator kit and maybe a membership with AAA."
car_1588,Try the 428i,"Picked up my 428i yesterday. Was worried that the 4 cyl wouldn't be enough, and that I would not be getting the BMW ""experience"" if i didn't get the i6.  None of these fools must have driven the 428i, because they could not have been more wrong. I started driving my car around and seeing what it can do and WOW... I couldn't possibly want more. This car is fast, and I mean FAST. This car is superb, and does not need the i6. In all fairness I am sure that the i6 is fantastic but make no mistake ladies and gents, the BMW 428i will knock your socks off and gives very, very little reason to upgrade to the 435i. I am aware that the M4 may be another story,but that will be reserved for big spenders"
car_1589,Excellent car for demanding drivers,Got mine a month ago with the sport package.Drives really well especially in sport and sport+ modes.Cornering is excellent as is acceleration and braking.Road noise is higher that I was expecting and there is a little bit of vibration in sport model at slower speeds especially with the sunroof open.Asbsolute fun to drive for demanding driver..
car_1590,I (almost) love everything about it.,"As far as I could tell there were only two cars that met my desires for a coupe with AWD, Manual transmission and forced induction for Colorado altitudes. The BMW 435 ended up being my choice. The other choice was the A5/S5.The 428 would have been a competitor for the A5 if it was available with manual. Anyway I drove a S5 and compared it with the 435.I preferred the S5 looks but engine dynamics are noticeably better in the 435 (if the sport mode is active). My car has a manual, so sport mode doesn't fool with the transmission shift points as it does in the Automatic cars. As expensive as it is the 435 seems a better value than the S5. I wish it was all wonderful but it could be better."
car_1591,European Delivery Experience,"We've just returned from our European Delivery experience and it met and exceeded our expectations.We picked up our F32 at the BMW Welt and toured the factory.In the week before turning it over to be shipped to us in the US we put over 1,800 miles on it and toured Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France.The ride was super and although I did obey the break-in guidelines, did not exceed 100mph or 4,500rpm, the car performed very well.It's a much smoother ride than my '09 335i which has the sport package.Having the ability to select between ""comfort"", the default, and ""sport"" or ""sport +"" was very nice. Although the numbers don't reflect it the cabin feels noticeably larger. 4/2/16 - UPDATE:  After almost 2 years with this car I still love it.  Other than the turbo-charger needing to be replaced I've had no issues with it.  Still drive, runs and looks great!  Very convenient when my wife is with me in the car that when her phone rings the car's blue tooth picks it up and allows us to answer with the car.  No switching between phones."
car_1592,435i xDrive - They got it right!,"This is my fourth BMW coupe and my favorite by far.It is powerful, yet refined, it can be a beast or a comfortable daily cruiser depending on what mode you put it in.Gas mileage is decent for a car with 300 HP, but Sport mode will of course decrease efficiency.I decided to custom order and get almost every option, including the M Sport Package.I test drove a ""Luxury Line"" and almost changed my mind about ordering the car - but glad I didn't since the M Sport just felt and looked 10 times better.Don't go cheap on the options unless they don't matter to you.I like the fact this coupe is larger than than before, it is actually a tiny bit longer and wider than the 3 series sedan."
car_1593,Very balanced car,"Ordered a 435xi luxury edition in sparkling brown with cold weather, driver assistance, premium and tech packages. The sparkling brown paint is lovely and depending on the lighting, it can appear black or purple too. The acceleration is quick and the car is fun to drive in sport/sport+ mode. I find the eco mode to be a little slugglish, especially after starting from a full stop. The engine auto shut-off is a nice feature and you can how much fuel you are saving by driving it in eco mode. The rear seats also have decent room for a mid sized adults. Overall, it's definitely an improvement over the 335 since it has a wider stance and it feels more sure-footed especially in fast corners."
car_1594,Amazing car,"Just traded in my 2011 328i coupe for the new 2014 428i. I am very pleased with it so far. Right away, I have noticed that this car uses a lot less gas than my previous car with the new engine and transmission. You'd never know it's a 4 cylinder with how fast and smooth it is. This car also seems smoother and quieter than the previous one. The iDrive and modes makes it feel more up to date on the interior. I have gotten lots of looks and thumbs up driving this car around town. The mineral gray paint color is amazing."
car_1595,This is my second 645 Ci ! I LOVE IT!,"You should know you're going to have a timeless classic that is the best driving car you will ever own! Just drive one; any one. You will want it and make it happen if you're lucky. It is perfectly designed and balanced with flawless road manners. My mouth waters, thinking of it. I keep it in storage for the Buffalo Winters. My first one, I had on the road for occasional winter driving and it was fine."
car_1596,Love my Bimmer - But I'm a hands-on owner,"Unless you have deep (very deep) pockets, or are comfortable doing routine maintenance on a high-tech vehicle, the 645ci probably isn't your best choice unless you're able to purchase an extended warranty. I drove a 1984 633csi for about 20 years -- thoroughly loved the car. When work required more travel, I upgraded to the 2004 645ci. I was able to pick one up a 2-owner with 85,000 miles for right around $13K. Financed through the credit union and added a $3,200 3-yr/36K bumper to bumper warranty; total price $16.5K or so. (warranty paid for itself the first trip to the shop when the transmission started leaking -- $5,300 expense; I had to pay a $100 deductible). The Bimmer is a FANTASTIC touring car on the road and fun to drive around town... Has plenty of power and a beautiful and unmistakable design."
car_1597,Excellent condition,Fast vehicle
car_1598,This is the best BMW I have ever driven,"I purchased my first BMW in 1987, a BMW 325is. Since then I have owned a BMW 528i, 328i convertible, 1988 M6, 540i, 745Li and now I own a 2004 BMW 645ci Convertible. I will tell you this as a prior BMW owner this is the best BMW I have ever owned. I love this car so much I can't bring my self to even drive it in the rain. I only have 14,000 miles on the car. This car turns heads, causes other vehicles horns to blow and lights to flash when approaching. My Lady always wants to a company me in the passenger’s seat. She's is nobody's fool. She knows wherever this car goes there is a lot of attention given and she enjoys being apart of it. This is truly an Ultimate Driving Machine."
car_1599,"Beware ""the convertible roof""","Love to drive my 645 when the roof works which is not very often over the last year.  BMW can't fix it after 4 attempts on my nickel and I can no longer afford these repair bills.  Like some women, this car looks absolutely terrific, but don't even think about getting too close.  It'll cost you!  There are other cars out there that are a joy to drive, do the right thing - buy a coupe!"
car_1600,Too much fun in the sun,"This car is not the best in any category, there are better looking, faster, cheaper, whatever the category.  But as a package, this car is the one to take out on a winding road on a Saturday afternoon.  Or you can just drop the top and actually enjoy your drive to work, as I do.  It has all the power you need to be pushing well to the right side of 100 by the end of the average on ramp.  It sticks to corners like glue.  And yet is behaved enough to not look like you are finally living out your high school fantasy - even if that is exactly really what you're doing."
car_1601,Awesome,"Awesome is the only word to describe this vehicle. Engine performance, handling, braking, comfort, exterior, accessories-it has it all. The closest to perfection I have seen."
car_1602,Beauty in motion,A blast to drive - can't leave it in the garage and take the Lexus!
car_1603,Outstanding,"A dream come true. I am a car fanatic and I have had cars ranging from Fords to Mercedes to a Viper.  The moniker ""the ultimate driving experience"" is so true. I love my 645ci with the sport package and 6 speed manual. Performance and handling is exceptional and the sport seats are so comfortable yet will hold you in place when you zip into the twisties.  No complaints against the car not even the I drive which once you get used to becomes second nature."
car_1604,Sporty yet practical.,"Just invested in a used 2004 645Ci convertible, Sapphire black on cream leather with a 6-speed manual transmission, with only 16000 miles... great vehicle!! Combining performance, fun-to-drive factor and practicality (can take some friends in comfort in back seat). Although the design is now nearly 3 years old, the 645's beauty will never age. Would recommend the car to anyone with car-fever."
car_1605,Best Car I ever owned,"I have owned 6 BMWs in my life starting with the 2002tii in 1974 and continuing through a 530i, 633csi, 740iA, 745i and now the 645. It is by far the best car I have ever owned and still makes me smile after 2 years of driving."
car_1606,Fun But ...,"This is a magnificent car, providing more niche-fillers than any other car on the market: a true sports car, with excellent speed and handling, top luxury, eye-catching look, available with a stick, and a back seat and trunk that are actually useful. However, the alloy wheels are so soft I'm on my my third set, and despite their advertising, BMW will do anything to avoid having the warranty cover anything more than the usual minor issues. The software on the care is unreliable too and the car is a gas hog. Even so, I love it, but it's hard to accept being treated poorly by BMW given the nature of their advertising and the cost of this car."
car_1607,The feel good factor is priced in!,"The 645 is truly ""sport"" luxury.  Not nimble and quick but muscular and responsive.  The extra horses of the 650 should help.  The iDrive is not difficult...if you can't figure it out you most likely can't afford the car anyway!"
car_1608,Porsche 911 Carrera meets practicality!,"I would choose BMWs over Mercedes and other equivalent cars. Having said that only cars I would drool over this one are BMW M5 and M6. I got this car with full option and everything ranging from parking distance control to cold weather packages, all very useful. If you hear people complaining about the BMW iDrive system, don't believe them. Unless you are very old- fashioned and don't know how to use a computer, you won't have a problem with the iDrive function. This car has a surprisingly big trunk and back seats are plenty for people under six feet tall. This car drives like a Porsche 911 but it can also be driven like a luxury sedan so it's lot more practical for everyday use."
car_1609,"Not an M6, but it is pretty....",The vehicle handles wonderfully and weight is perfect.  One of the best 2 door convertible on the market... The Aston Martin Convertible DB9 is the only thing that can touch it...
car_1610,Couldn't Be Any Better!,"Best vehicle I've ever owned. This one has it all: performance, sporty, luxury. Great combination of mastering the road and pampering the driver. I'll probably get another one when my lease is up. This one turns heads and gets lots of compliments all the time - and is still exclusive enough that I rarely see another one on the road."
car_1611,645 ci has no equal in the market,"SMG makes the car hard to drive smoothly. Active steering feels awkward and unnatural. Otherwise the car is a terrific driver. I can live with the iDrive. I think there is a little dodge stratus in the back. It makes the car look cheap honestly. I never quite got used to the awful trunk. The car seems confused on whether to ape porsche or dodge.The front is unique, not really attractive but not particularly ugly either. Saddle up behind the seat, and the outside won't matter any more."
car_1612,Awesome!,"Talk about a fun car to drive! I don't 
get very excited about driving cars, 
but when I got behind the wheel in a 
test drive, I immediately knew there 
was no other. Now that I have the car, 
I don't want to stop driving it."
car_1613,A great car,"If you like to drive you'll love to 
drive this car.  I've owned five 
convertibles, my last being an SL500, 
and none of them comes close to 
the ""ultimate"" driving experience. I 
can wait to get it out wesr with no 
speed limits!  It is very comfortable 
to ride in, which my wife really 
appreciates. A great automobile."
car_1614,love my 645 coupe,"i love to drive my 645 coupe. i feel very safe in it. 
the power and handling are fantastic."
car_1615,645cic,This is a great car!
car_1616,Was this a Good Choice?,"I love my car.  I love that fact that 
you don't see one everyday.  My 
problem is my car has been back for 
service 4 times 4 mths. 4x for the 
flat tire monitor.  Its in the shop 
now and has been there for a week.  My 
A/C comes on by itself, sometimes the 
window 
goes back down when you roll it up 
and the radio has frozen up three 
times.  This car was not ready to be 
sold.  I love the power and 
performance.  Heads turn everywhere I 
go.  If BMW can get the computer 
system under control, this would 
almost be the perfect car.  Even 
though it's a 
sports car, the convience package 
would be nice to have for the price.  
I can't wait for the M6."
car_1617,If you're REALLY a car person......,"and money is no object, this is the car 
for you. The design and styling is 
something very special and the drive, 
handling and sound of the vehicle is 
unmatched. I heard all the comments on 
the I-drive and expected a lot worse--
it's not a problem to work at all. Grab 
the Sport Package is it adds bigger 
wheels and very comfortable seats, plus 
some other driving goodies. For a 
fairly large car, it handles like a 
little sports car without sacrificing 
comfort. It's a very special and unique 
car for someone who does not have to 
ask ""how much"" when ordering one. I'm 
thrilled with my silver convertible 
with a black top and cream beige 
interior. One of the best cars I've 
ever owned."
car_1618,Best Handling car ever owned,"I had been a Mercedes CLK 320 
owner..loved that car UNTIL I purchased 
the new 645ci Convertable. There is NO 
comparison. The BMW handles better,is 
more efficient,does what I ask it to 
do,responds beautifully.drives smothly. 
Have not yet driven in snow,but I am 
sure will be fine. The convertable 
mechanism is great,,absolutly nothing 
to do except press one button. top 
up/or down in seconds.Cannot extol 
virtues enough. will NEVER go back to 
Mercedes. BMW also much easier to do 
business wiht."
car_1619,Bugs in the Computer,"Love the car, drives like a dream.  
Brakes are wonderful.  Car attrackes a 
big crowd. Unfortunitly, severe 
creaking with body twist and active 
steering gets floaty over 105mph.  
Back seat is just for groceries.  Car 
has been in the shop for total of 15 
days and 4 trips in first 2 months, 
all computer related.  No radio, no 
phone service, navagation meltdown, 
iDrive meltdown.  This car was just 
not ready to be sold to the market, 
they needed another year to work out 
the bugs."
car_1620,Will drive this car for 10 years.,"What I think is best about this car is 
how well it operates in the two roles 
of luxury cruiser and sports car 
convertible. Overall it is 
exceptionally self assured and holds 
the road with tenancity.  The low 
grumble from the v-8 sounds great. As 
a luxury car it compares to anything 
out there. But put the top down, 
select the sport setting on the 
transmission and you have a car that 
will give you all the excitment you 
want and remind you of what fun 
driving is.  Additionally the 
aerodynamics are phenominal. At any 
speed up to 80 mph, with the top down 
and windows up the car is quiet and 
there is virtually no wind buffeting 
in the front seats."
car_1621,Phenomenal,"This is an amazing car. The i-drive is 
not as bad as some say, but it is a 
silly piece of show-off design. That is 
the ONLY quiblle about this car. It is 
astoundingly fast and handles equally 
well. It turns heads wherever you go, 
and the interior has all the comforts 
you could want. The best car I've ever 
had."
car_1622,my thoughts,"awesome performance, BEAUTFUL with the 
top down,with onlt pretty up."
car_1623,In for service,"Over 20 days in shop in 3 months.

the ride the feel and the pure stick to 
the3 road handling that BMW is known 
for. For total luxury in an automobile 
I would vote Mercedes, but when you 
combine Luxury, styling and just pure 
adrenaline nothing touches what BMW has 
done with the 645 CiC. Gotta go know, 
81 degrees no humidity and the sun

7's) for 20 years--- while nothing 
competes with the new 745I for sheer 
comfort and overall drive, the same can 
be said about the 645's looks, handling 
and performance in a sport coupe--the 
only complaint I have is the lack of 
little amenities such as a coin holder 
or the placement of the extra outlet 
for your phone-otherwise it was worth 
the 15 year wait. Driving the car makes 
driving fun again-like it was when you

car_1640,Lucky to have found one,"I just traded in my 5 series for the 6 
series coupe without ever seeing the 6 
series in person. The driver that 
delivered it said about 200 people 
honked at him between 
Ga. & Tx. with a thumbs up sign. The 
engine ""RUMBLES"" like a race car at 
same time the car drives like a dream. 
And finally, cup holders that work!"
car_1641,Gift from the automotive gods!,"This car is elegant, muscular, and sexy.  The fit and 
finish is world class. The exterior angles are unique

the way.  I can sleep, just thinking of it in the 
garage.  The Jet Black is gorgous!!"
car_1642,6 Series Convertable,"An extremely comfortable automobile 
with fantastic lines both inside and 
out.  The car responds very well at 
both local and highway speeds.  The 
triple lined top is unusually quiet; 
its operation a snap.  With the front 
seats brought partway forward, the rear 
was able to hold my petite daughter and 
six foot son.  In two weeks of 
ownership, I have been stopped four 
times by complete strangers remarking 
on its beauty."
car_1643,I'm Lovin' It!,"I owned a 2003 MB E500 (and an SL500 
before that) and I got tired of the 
electronic problem in the E class. 
Went to the BMW dealer, drove the 645, 
fell in love, went back the next day 
and purchased.  This is the nicest car 
I've ever owned, hands down.  It has 
it all over the SL500 which is not a 
true sports car!!  The SMG tranny 
takes a little getting used to but is 
more powerful than the automatic.  And 
I love, love, love the exhaust note!"
car_1644,love it!!!,"Traded 5 series w/sport package for 745 
in '03. Liked it but missed the 
handling/performance of 5 series 
w/sport package. After 5 mos, went to 
dealership for a part and saw 6 series 
on showroom floor. Couldn't resist. 
Walked out with a new 6 coupe even 
though we could not test drive. After 
driving for 1 month, I am in love. It 
was a costly impulse, but surley no 
regrets. Love it more each time I drive 
it. Glad I went for the part."

picking up my 2004 530i after a minor 
service, and KNEW that I had to have 
the car. Living in LA, it's destiny to 
drive a gran tourismo coupe.  The 
cockpit styling is sublime, the Logic 
7 Sound without compare. With active 
steering and roll stabilization it 
corners like on rails.  Wish the moon 
roof actually opened, but then again 
they do make a convertible.  Bluetooth

car_1651,Awesome New BMW 645Ci,"This is BMW's best automobile now.  The 
exterior and interior are flawless. 
This coupe is fantastic for taller 
people.  It's trunk space is 
phenomenal. Best of the all the driving 
is fun and the handling for such a big 
coupe is unsurpassable.  Be sure to 
take a look at this car if you are 
looking into a sports coupe.  I would 
take it over a Mercedes, Jaguar or 
Porsche any day.  The only car I think 
that is better is the Maserati Coupe."

car_1654,What a Ride,"My first BMW... a great place to start! 
Very attractive, comfortable and quick. 
Love the level cornering and the 
instant acceleration. Very smooth 
shifting. An eye catcher on the roads. 
Forget about the back seat space 
complaints... that's not what you'd buy 
it for. I-Drive is a foolish invention, 
but merely a nuisance once you get the 
hang of it."
car_1655,Best Coupe Available,"I just test drove both the coupe and 
loved it.  Great power and handling.  
Although some don't agree, I love the 
appearance.  It has strong elegant 
lines.  I have one on order.  It will 
be a blast to drive, but it is going to 
be hard to wait for arrival."
car_1656,The 645 is Incredible,"I just test drove the 645 coupe and 
convertible.  Both were just incredible 
although I settled on and ordered the 
coupe.  Mineral silver with black 
interior.

I think that BMW has hit it on the 
button with the 645.  I love the 
appearance of the coupe.  I think that 
its lines are strong, and classic, but 
definitely different that all of the 
other coupes out there, that seem to 
all look similiar, or odd.

Its acceleration and handling on turns 
was perfection.  Just a joy to drive.  
The interior cabin is appropriately 
luxurious for a sports coupe and with 
the idrive not cluttered up with a lot 
of unnecessary dials and gadgets."
car_1657,"SUN ROOF ""less""","This was always my dream car,, but a 
major Draw back for a Coupe that cost

design,, also extremely tight in rear 
sit."
car_1658,X-3,"The X-3 is just what we were looking 
for in the SUV class. It actually is 
considered an SAV(Sports Activity 
Vehicle). We recently had a baby and

transporting all the necesities. We 
like the smaller size than the X-5 
with better handling. The style is 
sleek and interior is roomy."

defective and am waiting for the 
dealership to get replacement parts."
car_1672,BMW,Wow!  What a great BMW!
car_1673,Love it!,"Would never believe I would have an 
SUV.  The little car is amazing in town 
and wonderfully handy after having 
driven sedans for business all my 
life.  Handling is brisk, pickup almost 
frisky, and the features are world 
class.  I have loved cars all my life 
and this one is a surprise.  The size 
is one of the best features-small 
enough to be nimble, but carries people 
and cargo like a bigger vehicle.  Glad 
I didn't get the smaller engine.  And 
people notice it everywhere.  My boss 
has a 5 series and she prefers mine in

car_1681,Fun car,"Great Car, fun drive but a little 
stiff. 3.0 is the engine to go with if 
you want to have some reserves, the 2.5

design and wonderful for a family with 
lots of storage and trunk space."
car_1682,Just what I've been looking for.,"Quicker and less expensive to drive 
than my 4Runner.  It holds the road and

the 6 speed and am very happy with the 
performance, in every respect.  I have 
put 2400 miles on it in all types of 
driving and conditions (no snow yet), 
and have yet to be disappointed.  I am 
averaging 20 mpg at an average speed of 
34 mph.  The cargo capacity is more 
than enough for the luggage of 4 adults 
(including 2 women) for a week, and 
passenger room is much more than I have 
been used to in other cars.  Premium 
package is worth the cost."

handles remarkably well for a vehicle 
this size."
car_1684,Went from X5 4.4 to X3 3.0 sport,"and have no regrets. This is a great 
vehicle for the right person. No, it 
is not cushy. No, it does not have as 
much wood in its interior as does the 
X5. But it is not meant to be either. 
It's a whole lot more fun to drive -- 
I have a smile on my face everytime. 
Is it the right vehicle for everyone? 
No -- but it's perfect for me."
car_1685,Amazing and fun to drive,"This has by far the best build quality 
of any car I have owned. I traded in my 
325I for the X3, and can say that the 
handling is almost as good. Of all the 
SUVs I have tested the X3 stands alone 
on it's performance and handling. The X-
Drive is a pleasure on snow or slippery 
conditions. Seats are very comfortable, 
and driving position is where it should 
be. The interior bike rack is a great 
feature for my Wife and I. I just can't 
say enough good things about this SUV."
car_1686,Awesome Ride,"Love this SAV. Handling is outrageous! 
This BMW begs to be driven hard. Sure 
this SAV might ride a little firmer 
but at least it doesnt wallow and feel 
as you though you are in a boat like 
most SUV's.  If you are going to fork 
over 40+K at least get the leather 
seats vs vinyl- and of course get it 
in manual!"
car_1687,X3 and I have one,"X3: tall seat and handling. Why not M3 
or Lexus? Or, as C&D mocks, leave 
the ""sports car on stilts"" and buy a 
wagon. Hey I want to sit a higher and 
enjoy sport handling. Some people get 
off on creamy leather, glossy veneers, 
bum warmers and don't want to feel 
anything -like say the road. It’s not 
the leather, veneer and truck feel of 
the X5 or Lexus that I want. I am from 
the BMW old school and not the fat cat 
who wants their BMW to be an ideal 
Lincoln. The wagon is great, but don't 
dismiss the X3 because it is not 
European. Europhiles state wagons are 
big sellers in Europe and the X3 is a 
nod to the US market. Wise up. UK 
presold their allotment for 2004."
car_1688,ONLY THE BEST,"What do I like most?-Where to begin! 
How about 4 years free BMW service, 8 
air bags, all wheel control, an 8 
speaker teriffic stereo/cd/etc. 
standard, turns like a cat, shifts one 
can't possibly feel, outrageous engine 
that's a delight just to listen to, 
quality abounds even in very hidden 
areas, a BMW team that will support you 
no matter what, and a GPS/emergency 
radio transmitter standard. I could go 
on but- just drive one. They'll have to 
pry you out of it!"
car_1689,Right on the money,"Traditional BMW quality and 
performance delivered as promised.This 
vehicle is pure pleasure we love the 
performance,wow what brakes and 
handling.The five speed automatic is 
smooth as silk and what fun in manual 
mode.Engine performs very well and 
fuel economy of 18/26 helps also."
car_1690,Daddy like!,"If you have the extra money and are looking for a quality built vehicle, the BMW 4 series Coupe is hands down your new car.  Handling, acceleration, comfort and just a damn fun car to drive.  There are to few cons to mention except for the elephant in the room.  The fully or even semi fully loaded 4 series will cause you to dig deep into your pocket book or wallet.  The only look the basic no frills 4 series  Coupe gets is as you pass them by in the lot on your way to the well equipped model.  The price was the only obstacle that prevented me from owning one of these dream machines."
car_1691,Just about perfect for where we are in life,"I just retired and my wife is about to retire.  It was time for a ""life-style"" car.  We wanted a convertible but, it had to be a hard-top for city parking and, to deal with our snow, we wanted either front wheel drive or awd.  When we saw this car at a car show it 'spoke' to us on an emotional level and it had those important features.  There aren't too many hard-top convertibles anymore; the EOS is on the way out, the Volvo C70 is history as is the Chrysler 200 hard-top.  The Lexus has zero trunk space even with the top up, and the Z4 and SLK are rear wheel drive.  The 428 x drive 'vert is just about perfect!  We decided to take delivery at the SC Performance Center near Greenville and it was a spectacular experience.  They let us drive their cars at high speeds, on a slalom course, on an off-road course, and, most impressively, on a skid pad that dramatically demonstrated the anti-skid program that prevented spin out.  Amazing!  Our car was dramatically delivered (and programmed) in perfect condition and we then took a 1500 mile road trip through the Outerbanks and mountains.  Over that distance, the car gave us ~31 mpg on 89 octane gas in ECO mode.  It's true that that hard top does take up trunk space but, we were able to easily carry two carry-on suitcases that allowed the top to be lowered.  (Our extra debris ended up on the small back seat.)  With the top down, the included wind blocker installed and the windows up we were able to easily talk without any buffeting.  Our local dealer has been extremely solicitous on price, and they threw in winter BMW mats, caps and usb charger.  We're very satisfied!Update:  We've now owned the car about a year and a half.  It continues to greatly please us.  Not a rattle, squeak or issue with anything.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product.  This is a premium car!"
car_1692,Happy NC driver,"I just bought a 2015 428i last month. I added a backup camera and the oyster dakota leather seats but kept the price under $42K. The 2015 model also comes with bluetooth streaming. (The tech is OK but not on par with many other 2015 offerings from a range of brands.) 

I'm a big guy (6'3"" and 300lbs) but I fit nicely in the wider, longer interior of the 428i whereas I always had trouble in a 3 series. I was also a bit cramped in the 2015 MB C300 and I didn't fit at all in the new Acura TLX.

In my opinion, the ride, transmission, and handling are far superior to my previous two cars (an Infiniti G37 and Lexus ES350). The closest competitor is the 2015 MB C300 (or wait for 2017 Audi A5)."
car_1693,Only car that people stop  and say nice ride.,Only car that people stop  and say nice ride.
car_1694,BMW 650i Convertible,"After driving a Lexus SC430 for 6 years, the only other reasonably priced car that caught my eye was the Beemer 650i Convertible.I was sold the minute I test drove it.My biggest concern was wind noise through the soft-top.That concern evaporated at 110mph on the freeway.This car is quieter than the Lexus with a hard top!!!Secondly, the car excellerates very well.Almost as well as my '66 Big Block Vette (but it's far quieter).I do miss the 4-speed shifting, but the sport mode while in the manual shift mode makes up for the need to clutch.This car handles like a dream.Lexus, take note: When you hard steer into a corner, the tires don't even while a bit.I love this car!!!"
car_1695,Best bang for your buck.,"First of all, you have to know what the 6-series is and is not.It is not a canyon-carver w/ it's porcine weight, but a GT rocket ship most comfortable near three-digit speeds on open road.It's the 2nd most depreciating car on the market, so if you find a good used example, snatch it up quick and thank the previous owner for taking the full brunt of depreciation.No problems and smooth.No car for this $ gets the nods, 2nd looks, thumbs ups, and in one case actual cheers, for it's mere presence.If you're a DIY'er, get on bimmerfest and learn the easy maintenance steps and save even more $.Note: 0-60 is nothing remarkable.60 - 120 is absolutely frightening."
car_1696,It's been fun,"After my 4-years with the SC430 from Lexus, I was unhappy with its soft steering - heard the purr of the 650's engine and fell in love - at last the muscle car I could not afford as a teenager, with the class that comes with maturity (OK agreed - if I was so mature, I wouldn't care - right?)."
car_1697,Very happy,"This car is a true driving experience. It is very comfortable even with lower back issues.  It has more power than we can use on most California highways.  The stereo and blue tooth phone systems are outstanding.  A truly wonderful ride in either Sport Mode or Comfort.  Recommend that all new car purchases have a complete detail outside their respective dealership and do not forget to include a ""clay"" of the finish.  This brings out the full metallic or standard colors in a beautiful way."
car_1698,2007 650i,"Total cost of ownership compared to competing cars is much lower. Acceleration and handling is great, so is the sports suspension."
car_1699,"""OH MY GOD""","What a great car Handling and power are incredible. Came out of a 530, never going back. what a ride."
car_1700,BMW 650i is superb,"Some don't like the car, but I have dozens of people telling me how much they like it. I had a 2004 645ci and it went like stink. Now my 650 simply is fantastic. Both cars have the most amazing grip and impart a feel of confidence. The iDrive isn't too bad, if you can't master it you must have a very short span of attention."
car_1701,6 series convertible,"This car MUST be driven to be appreciated.  Once test driven, I had to purchase it.  Acceleration is awsome.  Dynamic stability control keeps the car perfectly level in corners, as they say, like riding on rails!  And BMW quality speaks for itself!  Now thinking about the M6, but that may be too much power.  This car is the perfect performance luxury vehicle!"
car_1702,As always - Excellent!!,"Having owned BMWs over the years, I love and expect the superior quality, safety and performance these cars always provide. When BMW came out with the 645 I fell in love with the new, bold and innovative design, but it wasn't the time to buy a new car... and there's always a reason why! When I was ready to buy the 650i had been released and I bought my beautiful Monaco blue convertible. It's far and away the best BMW I've ever owned and well worth the wait! I cannot recommend any other car more highly than this one, it's worth every bit (and more) what I paid for it."
car_1703,Incredible value,"I got my 650i convertible with most options in mid-June and it was delivered flawless and has been flawless in the first 2000 miles. The iDrive is easy to use, although boot-up sometimes takes a while. A few minutes with the manuals is worth the time. The 650 is very well balanced and after break-in seems to get better mileage and has better response. I have owned more expensive cars that do not come close to this one dynamically or stylistically . It is not the fastest car, but it is fast enough for me. Lots of compliments on the design. When compared to cars costing over $20000 more the 650 comes out on top, IMO."
car_1704,BMW 650i is the one to get,"This car is just an extreme pleasure to drive, the handling, acceleration and features far exceeds the my other luxury coupe test drives.  The complaints on the iDrive are understood, but I use the voice control to access just about anything on the menu, without touching the iDrive. I live in the Miami area where there are many, many lux coupes out there, but the BMW always turn heads. Absolutely, no regrets buying this car."
car_1705,so sweet...,"The car is exceptionally beautiful, with clean sophisticated lines. The top is a wonder and absolutely effortless.  The car drives like a dream, it never seems to run out of power.  It is responsive and surprisingly nimble considering it's size.  I will never regret buying this car."
car_1706,WOW!,"I just took European delivery of my 650i convertible in Munich, Germany. I loved every minute that I spent in the car. I am already in withdrawal waiting for the car to arrive in Atlanta! Even though I was babying the engine for the 1200 mile break-in period, I was still amazed at the power and performance even though the rpms didn't exceed 4500.  I was even able to go 150 mph on the autobahn and not go past 4500 rpms. In a word: WOW!"
car_1707,To Live For,"I just knew on the day that I test-drove both the coupe and the convertible that I was going to get my own coupe. The look says: That's right, I am mean. You insert the key and you hear that aggressive rumble in the back. You press on the throttle a couple of times and you realized that you've been smiling like an idiot. Depress the traction control and activate the Sport button and the car takes off likes hell on wheels. Find a loop and keep pushing against the curb -never touch the brakes- and you'll feel like you are ready for NASCAR. All the while, people will try to catch up with you so they can give you the ""thumbs up"". The car makes you want to drive while making you look better."
car_1708,Better than expected,I love this car. Driving it is even better than I imagined it would be as I waited for it to arrive.
car_1709,best convertible ever,This car handles incredibly and offers a very quiet interior ride compared to many convertibles.
car_1710,Best of the Best,"This car is top notch !  After evaluating several convertibles and fun cars and considering the BMW 7 series (there isn't a convertible) I chose the 650 convertible and haven't been sorry !!  The POWER is incredible, the looks I get driving it and the special fun of driving with the top down !  GREAT GREAT GREAT car !  Love the voice commands !!  J."
car_1711,Great car... but,"Car is a great blend of luxury and performance.  It is really a great driver's car able to do the commute as well as the weekend get away.  Trunk is small with top down, but still fits golf bags.  Don't get this car if you don't like to draw attention to yourself.  Am always having people come over and talk to me about how the car looks."
car_1712,Awesome car!,"If you can afford this car and want a FAST, great handling coupe, go buy one. My old BMW doesn't even compare to this car. You won't see very many on the road and heads will turn when you drive by. I can't say enough great things about this car."
car_1713,Gonna Love It,"This a sporty car, very confortable for 2 passengers. Lots of power, Stupendous handling. Sound system its great."
car_1714,The most amazing car to drive,"This car has it all: amazing power (360 hp), exceptionally comfortable seating, ever bell and whistle (every single one!), sexy exterior, and it's a convertible. You will love it... I certainly do!"
car_1715,Close to Perfect,"I bought this car because I wanted to know what it was like to drive on the autobahns of Germany at speeds they were intended for, and the 650i lets me do that.  I haven't had to pull over to the right lane for anyone yet.  The acceleration, whether starting from a stop or at 100 mph, pulls you into the back of your seat.  Merging and passing is effortless.  The car grips the road at top speed (157 mph), around corners, or even on wet surfaces.  It makes you feel almost too safe.....  I used to be a Mercedes guy, but I have definitely switched.  This car drives so nicely and smoothly, has such a simple elegance inside, and turns heads because of its awesome exterior.  I am 100% satisfied!"
car_1716,What a rush,"From the moment I got in, it was and is an experience I look forward to every time I use the car.  My only two complaints are 1)  the seatbelt is uncomfortable (what one isn't)  2)  A slight hesitation off the line.  Otherwise an exhilarating and awesome experience."
car_1717,Overall Excellent,As cars come and go -- and for me there have been many -- this one ranks at the top with my Porsche.  Far surpasses the Mercedes CLK430 that it replaced.
car_1718,BMW Engineering at it's finest,"Over the years I've had quite a few cars. I test drove the 650 and was instantly sold. The performance is stellar, the handling amazing. This car does everything right. The people that complain about the iDrive, haven't used it or taken the time to learn. I had it down within a couple of days and appreciate the simplicity. BMW has won me over, I don't know what took me so long!"
car_1719,Dream Machine,"Without a doubt, the BMW 650i is the hottest car I've ever driven.  You just have to be careful about your speed because as you step on it, you can't feel anything shift... it literally glides from gear to gear like no other car I've driven. I see tickets in my future and I'm not talking about the ones for a show.  I had concerns about the iDrive, but I found it pretty intuitive to use and I'm getting more comfy with the voice commands.  All in all, the car is a beautifully tuned machine.  The front end of the car is a lot prettier in view than the back end.  But then the ""not so pretty"" back end gives the car a hint of less pretentiousnes with a really big trunk."
car_1720,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"In January, I traded a 1996 Porsche 911 C4 Cabriolet for the BMW 650 C Convertible.  This was the first vehicle that had the WOW factor for me since the Porsche.  BMW does a much better job with both interior and exterior finish than BMW, has a better warranty, better service, and now  has built a coupe that handles as well as the Porsche.  The upgraded sound system blows you away and the car is teaching me how to use voice commands. I'm learning.  Steering is responsive, acceleration is as good as the 96 Porsche, it is more comfortable than the BMW X-5 I own and I can't find anything BMW has left out.  GREAT AUTOMOBILE!!  If you can afford own, buy it."
car_1721,Best Luxury Sport Convertible,"This by far is the best vehicle I have driven, and the best looking. I have had the Nissan 300z turbo and test drove the new Mercedes CLS and the SL 500, there is no comparison the performance and luxury you get with the 650I. The iDrive was confusing until I took about two hours to learn it while parked in my driveway and now it is easy. The voice commands also eliminates a lot of manual functions that comes with the iDrive."
car_1722,I love it (but!!),This is the best operating and driving car I have ever owned. My only beef is that BMW forces the iDrive which is at very best dificult to operate. I have been in DP fof 30 years and I struggle with it. The dealers and the consumer service folks are nice but don't understand the iDrive either - I would pay extra to have the car without it!
car_1723,First Month Review,"Overall this car has been great fun to drive--a great performer with solid construction.  The big V8 provides ample acceleration to dust away those pesky Mustangs.  The interior treats the driver and a single passenger to indulgent comfort, but back seat passenger = contortionist.  Style, comfort, acceleration, fit and finish all get high marks.  Less impressive is BMW's implementation of the iDrive interface, with special admonishment for the MP3 system's inadequate display of song information.  Stalwart critics of the Bangle Butt have a point, but are typically so far behind me in traffic that I can't hear them.  This is a car that demands attention while putting the driver in command."
car_1724,The 650 Rocks!!,"Great car - fast, incredible handling - much better than the Mercedes Benzes that I've owned. The back end is still a bit too much Bangle, but performance is amazing."
car_1725,650i BMW Convertible,"I have been used to Mercedes since 1985 and fine this a fun car to drive. Needs some help in the rear seat area. Also needs touch screen when using your bluetooth phone. Passenger side needs memory seats. The ""I"" (information) button and screen are a little confusing and you have to be careful using it when driving. I did not get the head up option and that would be helpful using the navigation screen and the ""I"" system"
car_1726,Awesome wheels,"In spite of Chris Bangle, this car rocks. It just oozes,""Move over, I'm here."" Great looks, performance, comfort. It says, ""I've arrived."""
car_1727,FUN,"Fast, fun to drive. Looks great and has the comfort of a sedan, at least in the front."
car_1728,Away with the iPod,This is a wonderful automobile except for two very annoying things. 1. The iPod control knob is a disaster. It requires unsafe driver attention to use and is a dangerous distraction if used while moving. 2. The stereo system turns on each time you start the car. This is very annoying.
car_1729,AAAAWSOME CAR,This car is EVERYTHING I expected it would be. Great to look at and drive.
car_1730,ultimate driving machine,"I have owned Mercedes for the last ten years I owned a Porsche and Jaguar. This is the first BMW I am totally pleased with my 650, its the fastest car I have ever owned, and the interior is not only beautiful but very user friendly, I recommend this car to anyone that enjoys driving."
car_1731,A driver's car,"Super fun to drive. Extraordinary power surge in overdrive. Road handling second to none, even on wet pavement. Haven't had the top down yet due to endless rain in NYC, but can't wait to get to Florida and let her rip."
car_1732,WOW,"It does not get any better than this. I traded a SL500 as I felt it was all name but poor mechanically. What a shock to drive this 650! I am sort of a car nut and buy lots of cars - I have never owned anything this much fun to drive, this comfortable as a sporty car should be. In short, If a converitble is in your future, this is the one - comfortable in the back, plenty of trunk space and no lack on driving thrill. I am a tough critic and this is the best."
car_1733,Great car,"Drives great and feels the way a BMW should feel. So far my only concern is that the quality of the standard fake-leather seats does quite meet my expectations, and then the front door in the coupe version is so long that getting out when parked next to someone is often a challenge."
car_1734,BMW has its mojo back,"In Jan 2017 I replaced my bmw435i xdrive  with the 440ixdrive with track package and manual trans; while the cars are very similar, the440 is big improvement; for a slight increase in price, more items are standard; seats better, interior nicer; entertainment system better ;although the is no longer hardwire controller for the i pod;but the main improvement is in PERFORMANCE;the new six is stronger smoother with better gas mileage; handling improved with quicker response more accurate steering ; more powerful brakes ;firmer but comfortable ride and that was with winter tires; the above mentioned is even better with the stock non runflat  Michelain pilot  summer tires;while the 435 was extremely  competant, this car has a stronger driver connection and is fun to drive"
car_1735,Sexy and powerful,"I fell in love with the BMW F32 4 series the first time I saw one.  Long sexy lines, low and wide stance, long drop hood and long sloping rear.  The new inline 6 cylinder engine is a major refinement for what is probably the most successful sport sedan/coupe in automotive history.  When you start the car, it gives you a heart pumping exhaust note.  Not obnoxiously throaty, but simply exudes power.  The 8 speed auto transmission is silky smooth as a BMW should be, easily shifts down when power is needed.  Handling is tight and controlled, the low and wide stance coupled with nearly even weight balance front to rear means this car can corner almost anything. You really appreciate the extra torque when you punch it on the highway, no hesitation, just presses you into the back of the seats.  Awesome.  I have owned three BMWs and the technology is finally catching up.  The new iDrive version is intuitive and much quicker than earlier versions.  I actually use the voice commands; they are intuitive and much easier to use than in past.  I particularly like the connected drive app to send destinations from my iPhone to the Nav system in the car so when I get in, my destination is ready to go.  I also like that Pandora and Amazon music are fully integrated to the app so I can stream music directly through the car and dump SiriusXM once the free trial is over. The front sport seats are super comfortable and adjustable, while the back seat is not really usable for adults (short trips only).  It's a 2-door coupe, I didn't buy it for the rear seats.  I'm 6'-2"" and very comfy in the cockpit.  Ok, for the not so great - for 2017 BMW changed their included maintenance to only 3 yrs 36k miles which means three oil changes.  No more wiper blades, you have to buy a $600 upgrade to get wiper blades in the first 36k and another boat load of cash to extend the maintenance another year.  It's a real downgrade for buyers and makes BMW much less attractive to own.  If you have a 36 month lease, this doesn't affect you.  I have the same complaints as everyone else - run flat tires suck, are expensive to replace and harsh to ride on, the electronic steering is mushy compared to the old days although every car comes with it these days, because the suspension is taught the ride can be harsh especially on crappy Northeastern roads.  It is a great car, pure joy to drive, sexy and powerful.  Definitely worth considering despite the maintenance plan change."
car_1736,"Great car, but could use a few improvements.","This is my second BMW convertible. My first was a 2008 328i. This new 2017 430i convertible is a very nice car with some improvements over the 2008 model but some disappointments also. First the good news. The 2 liter 4 cylinder dual turbo engine should satisfy most drivers. It has great pick up and is perfectly mated to the 8 gear auto transmission and greats 25% better fuel economy than my old 2008. The fit and finish is excellent and I feel confident this car will be just as reliable and trouble free as the 2008. The navigation is excellent, as is the voice commands. Gets it right 99% of the time. Now the bad news. After 9 years I expected a few more improvements.  The standard sport seats (which I had on my previous car) give great back support but are definitely too firm on the bottom portion of the seat. The blinkers on the side view mirrors are a nice touch, but are distracting at night. The dashboard layout is very familiar, but also a bit dated. For some crazy reason BMW decided to move the cruise control from a stalk behind the steering wheel to buttons on the steering wheel and in the process remove the power button for the radio from the steering wheel. I use the radio everyday. I rarely use the cruise control. The steering is lighter, but I think a bit too light. Brakes are also a bit too soft, compared to my 2008. All in all, a very nice car that I doubt will disappoint many people. I test drove other convertibles and came back to BMW. Choices are few if you want a 4 seater convertible."
car_1737,Good but not good enough,"I lease a 428i and was looking to lease a 430i. I did an apples to apples comparison to a Mercedes C300. The BMW came out a few dollars cheaper at MSRP, but I got a better deal with Mercedes AND the Mercedes has a much nicer interior and more comfortable seats."
car_1738,LONG DISTANCE TRAVELER,"WOW - What an automobile! I've owned a 
bunch of rides but this one really 
stands out. It's quick, very stylish 
and about the safest auto built. To 
really appreciate all the safety and 
comfort built into this car I suggest 
reading the owners manual several 
times. It has a very powerful A/C, for 
example, but one must learn its 
features. In summary - I could have 
bought any automobile but thankfully I 
bought this one."
car_1739,what is that light that keeps turning on,"it is a fun car to drive. this is my 
first  BMW. I had a vw jetta before, it 
sure rides more like an SUV than a car.
the 2.5 has sufficient power without 
having to spend the extra 6k dollars 
for the 3.0."
car_1740,Typical 1st year Bimmer,"BMW tends to use the 1st model year out 
as a beta tester, and the X3 seems no 
different.  I'm not a BMW basher, just 
someone who had an E36, then an E39, 
collectively, for 10 years.  My 
suggestion is to wait a year or two, 
BMW will get the X3 right."
car_1741,The New X-3,"We have been driving this new 
automobile for a month now and it is a 
superb SAV! The only negative comment I 
can make is the GPS Map is located on 
top of the dash board and in bright 
sunlight it is not very visable.  If 
this could be located lower on the dash 
board it would be much better.  Other 
than that it is a fun car to drive and 
is an 'eye opener' to look at!  BMW 
should be proud of this auto."
car_1742,Simply........FUN!,"Some of the reviews I've read say 
the ride is too rough.  Just not true 
in my opinion.  The sports package 
might increase the stiffness of the 
ride a bit.  It was a great mix of SUV 
feel with the fun of a sports car.  It 
is truly SUV meets 300 series BMW.  If 
you are interested in this car, don't 
listen to the few negative reviews 
that are out there in regards to the 
smoothness of the ride, but, rather, 
go test drive one of these beauties 
for yourself and you, too, will 
discover a sweet little ride."
car_1743,97-Z3 to 01-Z3 to 04-X3,"This is my third bimmer and it is no 
wonder why I'm hooked!  My biggest fear 
when leaving the convertible behind was 
the lack of open wind/sun when 
driving...NO worries!  The X3 sun roof 
is so sweet.  Got cooked yesterday 
driving along beach roads.  This engine 
is the same that powered my 01-Z3 and 
it is no less impressive in the X3.  I 
highly recommend this vehicle to 30-
somethings looking for more utility, 
superior performance, and the 
convertible, open-air lifestyle."
car_1744,WHAT A CAR!,"Today, I bought a BMW 2.5i. The best 
choice I ever made. What a great car to 
keep my kid, and my wife safe on the 
road. It grips the road like the tires 
are glued to the pavement. It's very 
good."
car_1745,GREAT AUTOMOBILE,"I traded in a great car for the X-3 
(Honda CRV, EX, Automatic) and got a 
better car. Look anywhere, try any 
control, try nearly anything with this 
fine automobile and you'll be thrilled 
at it's quality and performance."
car_1746,Where's the cream filling?,"Strongly built vehicle with nice 
exterior design.  Great acceleration in 
first but lags in higher gears (with 
automatic)and the engine is loud.  
Interior is downright chintzy (except 
for the sport seats). Visability is 
excellent.  Holds the road 
exceptionally well.  Nice cargo space 
and rear seats fold down flat and 
easily."
car_1747,Out of Yukon & into fun SUV,"Kids are off to college, out of the Mom

incomparable.  The handling is super!! 
the best!!!  I traded my old RX300 and 
drove the new RX330:the drive are the 
same.  The new RX330 had some minor 
detail enhancement and that's all.  I 
was not impress at all and to think 
that I've worked at Toyota in Torrance 
for more than 6 months. I know fully 
well that after owning the RX300 for 5 
years which  that the X3 is really

about the same with my old car, but of 
course I've been driving the 
freeways."

the post!!!"
car_1751,Very Disappointing!,"Test drove and compared MDX, ML 350, 
X3 and RX330, had high hopes for the 
X3, but is very disappointed. X3 is 
overrated, and disappointing in 
everyway except it is a BMW, has a 
good engine and is fun to drive. But 
the ride, forget about it. We are not 
racing everyday, we need a SUV 
attentive to our everyday needs, plus 
the options will eat you alive, about 
$46,000 for mine. So leave the option 
box unchecked! For close to $50,000, 
one could find much better cars. The 
style is OK, but the inside is cold 
and cheap looking."
car_1752,Hugely disappointed,"Went from a 325 to the X3 and boy am I 
disappointed.  The ride is atrocious - 
I could have saved myself the money 
and bought a Ford Explorer.  It 
bounces around the street so much that 
I don't feel in control at all - and 
that sense 
of control is what BMW is supposed to 
be about.  It rattles all over and the 
interior design is not consistent with 
a $40+ vehicle.  It shows no 
originality (unless you count rain 
sensing wipers!) - seems to be just a 
hodge podge of the 3 series and an X5 
and it doesn't work!  BMW should be 
ashamed of this one."
car_1753,some criticisms/some praise,"2.5L slightly underpowered. A/C 
problems. Ride very harsh. However,

car_1761,Superb Vehicle: Complaints unfounded,"Fantastic car to drive. Critics say the interior 
not up to BMW standards. But I find it very 
similar to the Z4 sportscar, and no one says 
the Z4 ain't good enough!"
car_1762,Cute and Sporty,"This is an excellent car for someone of 
any age. It's fun, reasonably priced 
and a performance vehicle all packed 
into one. What more could anyone ask 
for?"
car_1763,Is the X3 just a smaller X5?,"The X3's performance is outstanding as you 
would expect from any BMW; however, the 
interior quality and materials are definitely 
sub-par for a BMW and come nowhere near 
matching the X5's much nicer and more 
expensive interior.  Overall, I feel like the car 
isn't as solid as an X5 (the doors are lighter, it 
also feels much lighter when you drive it), 
although it handles very well.  For $48,000 
fully equipped, you should definitely get more 
quality for your money, but it is a good 
vehicle."
car_1764,Day One,"Picked up the X3 today after not 
being able to get together with the VW 
Dealer on a Toureg. More money than 
the VW but I think I will really like 
the choice. Tested the X5 also. The X3 
seemed as comfortable...felt a little 
lighter... and more nimble. Feels more 
agile than the Toureg.  Opted for Met. 
Black w/ 6speed manual. FUN!!  Quality 
seems great, fit and finish perfect, 
milage shows about 21.5. Clutch is 
touchier than my Jetta TDI but am 
getting used to it. The 3.0 doesn't 
seem as quick as my wifes A4 with the 
1.8 turbo. I'm sure after it loosens 
up it will be quicker. Corners, stops, 
accelerates on packed snow 
flawlessly.  So far am lovin' it."
car_1765,My BMW X3 2.5i,"If you like the X5, but can't afford 
it, look at this. The X3 has the looks 
of the X5, and the pricetag of the 
325i. Right now, I'm 13 years old. My 
dad bought one and he loves it! He has 
to drive about 60 miles a day and its

car_1768,Good car little maintenance required,Good car. Which required very little maintenance other than brakes which are very expensive to change.
car_1769,Good Daily Driver,"This is a great all season driver's vehicle.  It has good power and great safety.  It's excellent even in moderately bad conditions. Overall quality has been excellfent. However, Maintenance can become quite expensive as it ages."
car_1770,Eleven years going strong,"We purchase this 2005 3.0 X3 brand new. Besides its normal wear and tear and routine maintenance it has be by far the best and most reliable car we have had.We really got our monies worth, being with the military this car has been up and down the German Autobahn and cruising the Interstates in the southeast.Update: still running like a champ.."
car_1771,Worse Vehicle Ever!,"Rides rough, lots and lots of repairs. I have had the moon roof repaired 2 times over 9k, new brakes, lots of electronic problems, water pump, radiator, heck the whole car has had problems.  I only have 100k miles on the car. It has cost me a fortune."
car_1772,LOONG ROAD TEST!  181K,"I have to say, I really love this vehicle.  I have read many reviews about the poor quality, repair frequency and lack of comfort.  I think if buyers are looking for the softer ride of a true luxury vehicle, buy a Range Rover.  This little machine is still kicking butt at 181k!  I have had the normal repair costs; tires, brakes, etc.  The shocks and struts where changed at 175k.  They were the originals!  I think I have more than gotten my moneys worth.  The only real complaint I have is the panoramic roof.  It stopped working about 10k miles ago.  I have a fix for it, just haven't done it yet.  And the paint/stain on the interior.  The thing is, I just drove a 2008 X5 and that problem still exists.  I still gotta give my little 3.0, 6-spd manual, 181k mile Bimmer 9 outta 10.  Handles like no other in rain/snow, darn good fuel economy for an all wheel drive (averages 23mpg) and with all those miles and the black obsidian paint, it's still a head turner."
car_1773,Extremely poor reliability,"This car has terrible reliability in 3 yrs I have spent nearly $10,000 in repairs.- two A/C compressor hoses- sunroof leak- air mass meter- all for O2 sensors- complete radiator replacementDo not buy this car."
car_1774,Made Me A Believer,"So, always wanted a BMW...finally bought one off a 3-year lease that was certified.My salesperson said that once I owned a BMW that'd it'd be the only car I'd ever own again..he was SO correct!!The handling is great for an SUV; just like a sports sedan.And, yes, the ride is bumpy. I've read that it's been improved after 2006.But I don't mind..because it handles so great in snow & rain.I've had gas mileage 35 mpg on highway.Of course, with A/C on and driving in city, any car can be as bad as 10 mpg, no exception to date.Even with gas prices predicted at $5.00/gallon, I'd rather be in something safe than a roller skate getting 40 mpg.Think about it!!Planning on keeping this."
car_1775,First BMW ever!,"After my wife and I have bought the 2005 BMW X3 3.0i. We had no idea how different BMW's where compared to us having a toyota corolla and growing up with ford cars and hondas. At 82K miles we have yet to have any issues with our X3 3.0 aside from guzzling gas at an unexpected rate. But thats a given since we love to put it to the mettle with our 3.0i V6 on the high ways everyday we go to work, and we are on the highways a lot. We where surprised how a midsize SUV like the the BMW X3 3.0i can pack so much and have so many little surprises that you wont find out until you push it to the limit. It has ample enough room and yes the ride is rough, but this is a sports based midsize SUV."
car_1776,Good,"All around great car for design, reliability and comfort. Interior lacks a bit in luxury (for a BMW). Power to weight ratio also lacks a bit."
car_1777,Lovin' it,"Love this car! Nothing to wrong with it..they couldve really made it more fancy in the inside for a BMW..its lacking. Stereo isn't great, again for a BMW."
car_1778,62K miles and going strong,"Just had the BMW dealer do a full inspection of it and found nothing wrong at 62k miles! All I have done is change oil and buy new tires. The 6 speed manual allows me to have great performance but also allows to get the same or better gas mileage as any 2010 American or Japanese competitor SUV with 6cyl awd. Only difference is the required premium fuel, which is only like and extra $2 per fill up so who cares. Pretty sporty too, topped it out at 140mph before. Awd makes it handle corners and snow excellently."
car_1779,"120,000 miles later","Consider this a VERY long term road test. Everybody loves their new car, but after 120,000 miles ours keeps getting better. It had some minor problems which developed under warranty and which were resolved while we drove new BMWs when ours was in service. Great in the snow, great long distance cruiser. Mpg annualizes at 21.7.  All electrical stuff still performing well, gps probably ought to be updated but we don't use it all that much. Only possible drawback is it eats tires getting maybe 35k to a set."
car_1780,New to BMWs,"First time BMW owner, and so far impressed. Responsive steering, excellent braking, front seats very comfortable. Could have used more sound proofing for interior. Road noise and wind flowing across top noticeable. Tight fitting vehicle, no rattles. Titanium int. seems durable.  Easy to handle. A head turner. Cargo area seems small with rear seats up."
car_1781,Not happy,"I had a 528i before this (loved it). I thought I wanted an suv and bought this x3 with both the sport and premium pkg. Not nearly the quality, Interior is cheap looking and black on black peels off. Head lights didn't stay aligned, and having them aligned was not covered by warranty. Keys remote doesn't always work and I have to lock it with key. I have taken the keys back to BMW four times to have them reset. What a pain. Fuse went out on auxiliary outlet and BMW says not covered by warranty (this fuse cost less than $1.00). The car looks ok on the exterior, but the sunroof rattles like it is broken, BMW says it is normal operation. Overall, this is a car."
car_1782,Stiff ride,"It is unbelievably bumpy and you will feel every seam and pebble in the road. The handling is great, though and braking is the best I've ever experienced. Peppy and plenty of power but at an expense (91 octane fuel) The leatherette seats are just awful, ugly and uncomfortable. Cold in the winter and probably hot in the summer. Get the leather. The wood and aluminum trim provide the only other classy touches to the interior. It's a head turner around town. Black sapphire is gorgeous in the sunlight."
car_1783,Incredible SAV,"I have had this x3 for 4 months and MAN, it's great. We own a 2003 325Cic, and the x3 handles and moves better. Stability and handling are just amazing, let alone the braking capabilities. The 5-speed auto tranny is just right and shifts smoothly, the sport program feels eager to go, downshifting and holding gears in the right moments and situations. The tiptronic manual program is great when you want to really drive. I would rather have a 6 speed manual, you lose invaluable torque with the automatic, but not a big deal. Cornering is just like a 3-series. The aggressive look is perfect, it tells BMW all around, love the style."
car_1784,Not happy,"This is my second bimmer, I realize it is not the luxury model of my 528I but the sunroof rattles, the fuses to my 12v outlets keep blowing,Interior black on black is peeling, none of these things are covered and I must pay for diagnostic to discover problems and then they aren't covered by warranty.  I'm thinking about trading. Love the look, hate the quality."
car_1785,Buy it!!,"We replaced my wife's 2000 528i with this beauty. I could not say enough good things about X3. If you are worried about gas mileage, or expecting soft Buick like ride then BMW is not for you. BMW is The Ultimate Driving Machine not a sofa."
car_1786,There are better values out there,"This X3 is a sharp car and drives like a 3 series sedan...this is a blast to drive. Outside of that, it gets less attractive.  It isn't very big for an SUV (ie Doesn't carry a lot of stuff or people). The fuel economy for a V6 is horrible (maybe 17-18MPG?) Four passengers in this thing feels like too many. The trunk is tiny (can't fit 1 set of golf clubs across). And the interior features aren't stellar for a $40K vehicle."
car_1787,Great Car,"The 2.5 has been surprisingly zippy to drive.  It is the best car on snow that I have ever owned.  Very rough ride and poor fuel economy are my two key complaints.  I've never had any significant problems and I have about 45,000 miles on it now.  It had several nuisance problems while under warranty like rattles and problems with warning lights but nothing significant.  BMW seems a little loose on their quality control, especially for the price. Overall, however, the car is excellent.  I have noticed it is a head turner too.  People still stop and look at it in parking lots and it is two years old."
car_1788,Head turner but only adequate value,"BMW X3 is the best SUV design on the road as attested to by the many copies springing up these days. The exterior alone sold me. Perfect size, perfect space, more car than truck-like, very open interior, very solid feel and very sporty.  If you want to keep some of your youth but want room to haul a growing family, this is your SUV.  One suggestion though: get the premium package (leather).  The standard (non-premium) package feels like driving in a big styrofoam cup that's always rubbing you the wrong way and the sport package will likely make you sick on long drives. My major complaint is the price, esp. when compared with similar SUVs (Volvo XC90) that offer more."
car_1789,The best SUV for the money,We have owned our 2.5L X3 for over a year now and we could not be happier.  This is an excellent crossover SUV.
car_1790,Not the most reliable,"Want to love my vehicle, but it was towed 8 days ago because it wouldn't start and service dept is still trying to figure out what's wrong with it.  Has spent 30+ days in the shop since I leased it at the end of Aug 05, and has less than 12,000 miles.  Multiple repairs, including replacement of belt tensioner and pulley (twice), parking brake repair, mold in A/C system at 8000 miles, transmission reprogrammed, key FOBs keep failing, hatch out of alignment, various rattles, sunroof malfunctioning, dash keeps going black while driving, airbag mat replaced.  Too much of a headache for the hefty price tag."
car_1791,Love Love Love Love It....,"I looked at the X3 on the advice of a friend who had one. I will never buy another car again. This is a fun, reliable car that is a blast to drive. It handles like any other BMW I have had the pleasure of driving. It is truly the Ultimate Driving Machine... the X3 is meant to be driven. I love the blue tooth option, hands free cell phone with my son in the car. It's great. An excellent choice for moms on the go."
car_1792,Disappointed,"The car is not built very well - it has developed all sorts squeaks, creaks and rattles. The ride is very firm, even a slightest road irregularity gives you a hard jolt. The cargo capacity is surprisingly low, although the car does not look too small. I would not buy this car again and would not recommend it to anyone else."
car_1793,X 3,"Nice SAV ride could be a little softer, great handling, good traction interior dash could use some improvement (looks) gas mileage ok. This is a performance SUV."
car_1794,Fun to drive,Great car to drive a little bumpy but not bad.  Fuel economy isnt as good as I hoped but better then others.  Overall like the car funt to drive will probably buy another BMW.
car_1795,"Fun to drive, room to spare","Buy the X3 if you are looking for utility and fun! I haul my dog and my wife's shopping bags almost daily. It is also my daily driver to work. I can get there in style and have fun with it. It has AMAZING handling. This SAV has good punch to it, too. The only bad thing I would say is the gas mileage."
car_1796,Love it ....but..,"Great to drive, well built, but way to complicated gadget wise.  If one were to learn to operate everything this vehicle has without repeated references to the manual, one would be qualified to pilot a 747.  Setting radio stations required over an hour of poring over the manual.  Give me an AC system where I can set the vents and fan speed and not have the computer change it every minute.  My husband was seriously considering buying one for himself, but has now changed his mind."
car_1797,Blue Water~~,"I so love my x3~~had an x5 and felt it was bigger, slower and boxier.  This is a fun car for everyone!"
car_1798,SUV like a sedan,If somebody doesn't need a roomy SUV X3 is a great choice. Very good performance and handling. Nice exterior design. Fantastic x-drive system makes it really safe on every road. Driving feels like being behind a sedan wheel.
car_1799,Great car--except...,"Great car, except it is tight in the back with three adults. Drives perfectly, and handles more like a sedan then an SUV. This is a bigger and more fun version of the 3-series. Same great handling as the little 3 but with all the fun of an SUV. Haven`t tested it out too much in the snow, but I am looking forward to the challenge. 4 years free maintenance is ALSO great.."
car_1800,Pure fun and excitement,"A family of four, we live at 9000 feet in the Colorado Rockies.  This vehicle has plenty of power, top end speed, and cornering ability. Very sure footed on ice and snow.  The hill descent control works great on steep and winding snow packed roads.  The cargo area, while small, holds a surprising amount of stuff.  The xenon lights are great for illuminating elk and deer along the road and peeking around corners further than normal lights.  It makes the 70 mile round trip to work everyday through a winding canyon a pleasure.  I would highly recommend this car for the mountains.  The body of an SUV and the soul of a sports car."
car_1801,love my beamer,"Excellent overall performance, its dependable, reliable, gives great mileage on the highway for a suv."
car_1802,Wish it used less gas,Wow what a great car/truck/suv.  I would expect it to get better gas mileage since it is based on a car platform.  Awesome ride and handling and what an amazing sunroof.  Got the red leather interior.  Interesting no one has it so it looks sharp.  Easy navigation system.  Not that much room in the trunk area but certainly enough.  Feels rock solid on the road and safe.  Memory seating build into key fob has to be one of the best features along with heated steering wheel. Great sunroof. It sure holds its value. Hope this helps. Thanks
car_1803,"Goodbye Trailblazer, 4ever.","A pleasure to drive.  Quick, nimble, safe, efficient, comfortable, sounds great, looks great, smells great.  Better Me Walk is not so true.  BMW For Life.  If people do their research, they will know that the X3 has a stiff ride.  It is a small performance truck.  DUH!!!!!!!!"
car_1804,Nothing to get excited about,"This is a noisy, uncomfortable vehicle with nothing to recommend it except for sitting up high.  Its power is ordinary; its ride is noisy and rough.  It has a strange rattle in the sunroof.  After all is said and done it is over-priced, too."
car_1805,first time Beemer fan for life!,"G-friend turned me on to bmw!  I wanted the utility space, high sitting position and a sport like performance.  This car, like the write ups states, is the car to get!  Only draw backs: the arm rests - slightly slanted downward my arm never finds comfort.  The leg room seems a bit confining - however with all the adjustments it all works out!  Gas fuel economy is not too bad if you are patient at 55 mph.  I have clocked 29 mpg on the h-way!  Usual combined city/ hway: 21 - 24  in a 3L engine with 224 hp - that rocks!"
car_1806,Great ride!,Never owned a BMW before. This 650i is pure fun to drive. Excellent performance combined with nice technology.
car_1807,Fun everyday,"I have put about 2000 miles on this car in a month.This car begs to be driven hard. It does everything asked of it and more. The gurgle of the engine is the sweetest sound I've heard.It has added a smile to my face everyday since I bought it. Pure fun.The car is extremely comfortable for two, tolerable for four.It is extremely smooth.Handling is superb especially in sport mode.It corners like it's on rails.The best display of power is between 60 and 100 mph.I was a little hesitant to buy a car with such a haughty image in a fairly conservative Midwest town but after driving it I don't care what anyone thinks. This thing is heaven on wheels!"
car_1808,Convertable Top,"I bought my 650i in 9/16/2009 with 3864 miles at a reasonable price.I now have 24,500 miles on it.I love the cars looks, styling and driveablilty.My problem is the convertable top censor.I have had it to the dealership and they have been great, but they cannot find out what is causing the problem.I have had it to the dealer on at least five separate occasions, it works for a while and then the sensor shows the top is not closed properly.Itstarted again today.Any ideas.I want to keep the car but I think I have a lemon."
car_1809,Smooth and Powerful Convertible!,"I bought the convertible three weeks ago and after 1500 miles I have to say that this is one sweet and powerful performance machine.  Around the city, the gearing and torque make the ride seamless, and on the highway the car has a blacktop-eating ride that wants to run much faster than the law allows.  Very happy with my CPO purchase - the car had depreciated $50K+ in three years, so with the extended CPO warranty to 100K miles and with BMW NA including free no-cost maintenance out to 100K miles as a sales incentive, it also fits the bill from a value standpoint.  sweet convertible that gets many a look"
car_1810,the '07 ages well,"I picked up an '07 650i coupe for $51K, plus trade in of a '99 M3 with 80K miles on it.  The 650 is a delight (sure, you say, what wouldn't be compared to the rusty horse I'd been riding), and in unexpected ways.  The seats envelope in a way superior to those in the 2009 MB CL I  rented and are far superior to those in the Carerra.  The engine sound is of elegant fortitude, the handling pugnacious when demanded but otherwise smooth and flat-out fun.  The sports mode is a bit jerky at times, but darn quick off the line (the normal mode, which my wife dubs 'the macher mode,' is far less responsive to the pedal stomp yet very smooth).  I feel very safe in it, although the A-pillar obscures a bit."
car_1811,Rear suspention problems,"Overall is a great car don't get me wrong. im been an BMW enthusiast for years but the dealer can't fix the wear of the rear tires on the inside. They want me to do alignment and put new set of tires at 22000 miles at my expense! Thats the reason i purchased a $80,000 car on the first place, insane."
car_1812,Unlike any other car....,"I looked at every ""similar"" vehicle - Porsche 911 and Cayman, SL-Class - but just couldn't find the right fit.  I am so pleased with my decision!  The car has enough ""sporty-ness"" to feel like a performance car, but without the harshness or diminutive stature of so many other ""sports cars"" (I'm 6'3"" and 250 lbs).  To say that it is in a class of its own is too trite, but there really isn't anything comparable.  Thus far it's been a whole lot of fun.  I'll let you know what long-term ownership is like."
car_1813,Exceptional Car,"For months I had been test-driving different cars looking for ""the one."" Porsche 911, BMW 335i and 135i, Mini, Audi and even the Volvo C70.  In my opinion, nothing else comes close in terms of the whole package.  This is a sexy car that flies, turns and brakes on command.  I just came out of a 530i and at 6'00, 250 lbs., I am more comfortable in the 650i.  Smooth and quiet, powerful yet reserved -- until summoned."
car_1814,BMW 650i overrated,"The BMW 650i is not what I expected. This is NOT a sports car. It is an overpriced  ""sporty"" sedan.  The manual transmission is awful.  The navigation system is worse. The car handles well for a sedan.  Acceleration from zero is not great, but it does have a great deal of power from 30 mph to 100 mph"
car_1815,Fabulous!,"I've owned a lot of great cars (i.e. Porsches, BMW M3s, etc.) but this car is the ""complete package"". The styling is gorgeous, great performance, superb handling and decent mileage for a V8! And if that's not enough, it's a convertible with 1 button control. I love this car!"
car_1816,Over rated,"This is NOT a sports car.  It is a ""sporty"" two-sedan.    The manual transmission is very disappointing. The car corners well, but is not very quick 0-60 mpg.  However, it does well getting on the freeway (30-70mph) It does not compare very favorably to a 911 Porsche, but it competes well with the SL 500 Mercedes."
car_1817,Severe problems in manual mode,"The 650 has what BMW calls an ""inherent characteristic.""  If you drive in ""manual"" shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop.  Imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard.  The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 (such as you might in a parking garage looking for  a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp) and to a lesser extent in automatic.  The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour.  BMW states the problem is with the  software-it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle. BMW won't fix the problem.  Stay away from this vehicle."
car_1818,Mile eater,"This car is a great touring vehicle. Very refined, comfortable and easy to gain speed. In a sense, this car is too good for American roads as it truly comes to its life and purpose at 130-150 mph, which is absolutely illegal in states. It effectively replaces a small airplane in Europe and loses much of its value stateside."
car_1819,Take a second look at me!,"I have now owned my 2007 650i convertible for 8 months.  Being a longstanding BMW enthusiast, I traded in my 2004 M3 convertible, a car that I truly loved. With the 650i, you get M3 neck-snapping acceleration with a more luxurious ride and interior.  The iDrive, although a pain at first, is actually pretty neat.  Go for the options: nav, Sirius, comfort access, bigger tires.  What's a few extra bucks at this point? This car will make everyone take a second look, especially when you're effortlessly passing them at 110 mph. This Beauty is a Beast!"
car_1820,Muscle Mania!,This car is a hot rod with the comforts of the 750i. I look forward to waking every morning and driving this car... great fun.
car_1821,This car has far exceeded my expectation!,The second day I drove this car down a two lane road with the top down listining to the purr of the engine I was filled with satisfaction that I'd made the right choice.  WOW! What a beast.
car_1822,Previous Porsche owner's observations,"Unmistakable German engineering.  Handling excellent for a car this size, but not as easy to corner aggressively as with a 911 and its ""oversteer"" which makes any turn at any speed effortless. This is more a touring car and less a sports car. Very comfortable and manageable interior.  The iDrive is very easy to learn and use.  Sport package, comfort access and heads-up (I do not have HUD) a must. You can't see the speedometer or tach when cornering which is a distraction when pressing the car around turns.  Overall a very impressive and formidable automobile.  Not quite the Ultimate Driving Machine, but an excellent stand-in.  A 911 is a 911, period."
car_1823,Awesome on the Autobahn,"Drove it on the Autobahn after European delivery in Munich all the way to Vienna - awesome power, handling and comfort. Navigation and heads up display took me right to my Vienna hotel. Car is great fun to drive and a real head turner - would strongly recommend 3/4 hours with the iDrive manual in order to fully appreciate it, particularly if used in conjunction with the steering wheel controls. Trunk handles two golf bags and rear seat is definitely functional. Heads up display and sports package a must as is upgraded stereo system. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle and also the European Delivery program - BMW does it right."
car_1824,You will not be disappointed,Went for a drive in the country last weekend and all I can say is WOW! Car was rock solid at 110 and when passing a car it was still pushing me back in the seat at 80. Has all the torque you would ever need. Soft leather seats and a well laid out interior. The exhaust rumble make you want to drive it. This car is a keeper.
car_1825,This IS the Ultimate Driving Machine!!,"This is my 2nd BMW 650i I had purchased 2/2/2007. I traded my 2006 650i coupe for a 2007 650i convertible. Since the sun roof did not slide back on the coupe I got the convertible instead. I am very happy and pleased with the convertible. This car has the perfect package: comfort, luxury, handling, performance, agility, and beauty inside & out. The color of mine is Alpine white with the new upgraded leather beige. Mine came fully equipped with all options except HD radio, which you cannot have if you have the real-time traffic for the navigation. This is an awesome feature to have. iDrive is not difficult to use, as long as you are willing to learn! People stop complaining!!"
car_1826,Best Car I've Ever Owned,"Although I've only had my 650i for a week or so, I am already impressed with the quality and feel of such a high performance, luxury coupe. It has plenty of power and very stable handling. My last car was an '05 Porsche Carrera. This BMW is much more luxurous and as much fun to drive without all of the bumps of a much stiffer suspension. Beautiful lines, classy interior, and the iDrive isn't at all that hard to use once I spent some time with it. I'm very pleased with my choice."
car_1827,One week old,"I purchased a 2007 650i convertible one week ago and here are my initial comments. The iDrive was easier to learn then I expected and, though working, the radio is certainly more complicated then having a couple of buttons, still the iDrive gives you access to many sophisticated features. That said, my wife, who owns a 2002 BMW 535, will not replace that car with another BMW if it has an iDrive which is too complex for her to operate."
car_1828,Stealth,My only complaint really is ease of access entry and exit. The front seats the lumbar sticks out too much and one has to twist to get in or out and it isn't not great on a problematic back.
car_1829,Black beauty review,Black beauty review
car_1830,Buy the best- my 15th BMW,"This is my 55th car and my 15th BMW.  I have always driven BMW's,Mercedes as well as all the Japanese competitors. I bought my 10 650 Convertible when I actually went in to buy another M3 Convertible and have no regrets. I am a small person so was concerned about the size of the car (I am 5'8"") I got the fully loaded Sport with every available option and got a fantastic deal. Just 2 days after I bought it, I took it on a 2000 mile road trip, what an amazing car! I averaged 24-26 MPG (at between 80-90 MPH) having coming from an 09 M3 Coupe, I do miss that punch that the M3 delivers, but my 650 handles very well and is quite quick.  The creature comforts are far superior to any competitors!"
car_1831,Get the Convertible!,"I recently purchased my 2010 650 CIC and I traded an 09 M3 Coupe and an 09 G37 Convertible for this beauty. Although I was very reluctant to give up my M3, I was happy to dump the Infiniti after only 3 months.  I am a small person (5'8"") so was concerned about the size of the car.  After test driving it for only 5 minutes, I knew it was going to be my next Beemer (my 15th). For the size of the car, when I am driving it, it feels like a comfortable coupe, excellent driving behavior and surprisingly good on gas (25 MPG HWY at 80 MPH average).  I got it with the sport package and every available option (black and beige) it is comfortable, fun to drive and has excellent road manners.  Perfect"
car_1832,2010 6er Germany,"This car is straight up powerful – and I have the luxury of living and driving in Germany. Bringing this car to the US will be a sin as one cannot fully appreciate the power and excitement that this car delivers. I dread the day when I have to drive the stagnant highways stateside.  I will miss the infamous autobahns and the speeds at which I can drive this great car. Handling is effortless and superb. ""I live for the moments that I take my 6er either to work every day or just out for a spin on weekends”. My 2010 BMW 650i Coupe is a world class car and true head spinner from the poor slackers that are stuck in their tiny 3 Series and Z4 Coupes."
car_1833,"Fun, reliable and good gas milage","Traded a Lexus RX300 for the BMW. The BMW is far more nimble and fun to drive. My gas mileage has been great, 18 to 20 in town and 25 to 26 on the highway. The BMW is not as quiet or luxurious as the Lexus but has more room behind the rear seat and the seats are more comfortable (still pretty hard though). My only complaint is that the interior is dfficult to keep clean. The dash and synthetic seats look tough but show every spec of dust. Advice: don't get the black interior."
car_1834,X3 Rating,"The only objection I have to this vehicle is the need to use premium fuel.  However, maybe that's necessary because of the outstanding engineering."
car_1835,Great SUV,The BMW X3 has great styling and sporty ride.  I can't wait to drive it in the snow.
car_1836,My first BMW!,"I waited a LONG time for this BMW..I wanted a smaller suv, always dreamed of owning a BMW, and fell in love with the X3 the first time I saw it. It's great looking, but I never expected it to be SO much fun to drive! This is my dream car. Gas mileage? Not bad... but the ride and handling alone have made me a BMW owner for life. Excuse my excitement, but every time I get into my X3, all I can think is.....""I'm driving  a BMW..finally!"""
car_1837,X3 3.0,"Had a 325 sedan years ago which was perfect but, with family needs, I needed a bigger car (Navigator which I still have and use).  But I had to get back to the BMW 3 series.  The X3 seems like a perfect marriage of many worlds -  its large but its compact, its fun but its safe, its fast but gets decent mileage, its a single passenger vehicle that is also for a family, its well made but not outrageously priced.  The car feels like I'm glued to a track.  The engine sounds are great.  I love it."
car_1838,sporty suv,I traded in my Trailblazer for a more fuel efficient car.  I love the stiff handling.  Almost as if I am in my own personal roller coaster.  The leather seats hug the driver and the simple yet classy interior make the driver feel like he is in the cock pit of a sports car.  Love my new ride and find the engine to be quite responsive with decent gas milage
car_1839,X3,The X3 is a very fun to drive SUV.  More carlike in its attitude with great traction in rain and snow.
car_1840,X-3 RIDES LIKE A TRUCK,"I now have 25,000 miles on my Bmw X-3 AWD with the 3.0 engine.  The reliability is excellent and i have had no maintenance problems.  The ride of the car is the big issue. I have this as a leased vehicle for 36 months and I can hardly wait for the 36th month.  I have even tried to trade this car for a different BMW at the dealer but getting out of a lease is too expensive.  The car rides like a truck-especially in the rear seat.  I feel sorry for those who have to sit back there so I usually take a different car if anyone has to sit back there.  The leather seats in the rear are uncomfortable too.  The people in the rear are bumped up and down even on smooth roads."
car_1841,Best mid-size SUV yet,"I decided to replace my 2-yr old Jeep Liberty with a sportier SUV, and found the perfect choice with the X3 3.0i. It is the perfect balance between function and luxury, not as soft and plush as the Lexus and not as utilitarian as the Subaru Forester. Handles like a BMW 3-series and has the hauling capacity of the Jeep liberty."
car_1842,"Great, reliable, and fun.","It is a wonderfully fun car to drive yet still is reasonable in size, fuel economy, and features.  The 2.5-liter engine can be a bit underpowered but most of the time gets you around with plenty of power to spare.  Fuel economy is great for the type of vehicle and interior design is wonderful. If I could bash on one thing it would be that the interior be a little quieter other than that the car has great visibility and can fit five comfortably it's a great buy. It of course drives like a BMW too so why not buy it."
car_1843,Besy Performance SAV,Outstanding Ext./Int. design and with one of the best 3.0 engine in the world
car_1844,New for 2005,"Although it has not been publicized, the 2005 X3 got a completely new suspension making it a much smoother reider than the 2004. Mine has the standard suspension and it is hard enough. The choice of tires is also important and the OEM Michelins ride far better and soother than the OEM Bridgestones which were rated as less than safe in the wet by Tirerack. Note that the cars are delivered with less than perfect alignment and when checked at an independant source, it was found so out of alignmemnt that it took the dealer hours to realign under warranty. Other than that the car has performed flawlessly and the assembly quality is better than on the X5, very much Austria built! Great car."
car_1845,Stiff Ride,very stiff ride without sport package. I wonder if the tires make a difference. Mine has Michelins.
car_1846,nice for an suv,"I traded a 3 series for this car and the extra space is great. I miss the handling of my 3 series but I like the compact nature of this SUV. Highly rec not getting the sport package as it is way too stiff. I also feel that this car, even with the 3.0, is not as powerful as it should be. We are a BMW family and it is hard to be fair comparing it to a sedan, but it is great for our growing family. I also like my installed DVD's in the headrests."
car_1847,I'll keep it,Performance and quality top notch. Ride rough on rough roads.
car_1848,Nice Little Beauty,"I also have a 2004 330i, so I was expecting my little X3 3.0 to be a smoker too.  Well...I know its not a fair comparison since it is encumbered by some extra weight and the drag of an all-wheel-drive system.  I was just expecting a little more POP. Nevertheless, this the most fun to drive and nimble SUV I tested.  Definitely handles like my sedan and gives me the same sporty feel. And - without a doubt in my opinion - the best looking SUV on the road - well...except for maybe the X5."
car_1849,I Love It!,"I have had my car for 6 months and continue to love it every time I get in the car! I had two 3 series before the 3.0L X3 and I loved them, but this car is wonderful! It's sporty yet luxurious."
car_1850,My X3,"This is a great car. I love SUV's.  My earlier car was a Ford Explorer.  This smaller vehicle is far superior for the city driving I do.  I don't particularly like the fact that I have to use premium gasoline, but with the good fuel mileage I get it's really not that much more expensive to operate.  It handles wonderfully and is fun to drive."
car_1851,WOW,"this car handles wonderfully. We had a huge snow storm, and we all felt safe in our X3.the interior of the car is very nice. We have owned Saabs,Hondas,Audis,and Mercedes, and we have never had a car this good.We will commit our car business now to BMW. Also the dealership was very nice to us, and gave us a great price on the car"
car_1852,First Impressions are lasting,"Recently traded an 98 Infiniti I30 for the X3. Always driven sedans but the X3 sold me on its practicality, fun to drive factor, and design. Solid feeling, spacious, engine growls!, perfect height for my 5' wife. Expensive but worth it. Very impressed!"
car_1853,Super Mid Sized SUV,"We traded a Mercedes ML 500 for an X3 3.0 a month ago and couldn't be happier with the change.  The X3 handles fantastically and is a blast to drive.  It has the tight finish quality that the American made Mercedes lacked and it carries as much cargo as the ML.  Ours was delivered with a faulty navigation computer, but this is being fixed and it doesn't affect the operation of the car.  Our only wish is that we bought the X3 sooner!"
car_1854,Best Car,Rode very well. Perfect amount of horsepower.
car_1855,BETTER THAN THE REST,Really love my X-3. It is the right size for me. I hate large SUV's and the other SUV's in the size category can be seen everywhere!! I went to the mall one day and came out only to find five Black Infinity FX's in the same row!! Love the look of the X-3. I get alot of stares. The power is perfect and I can still park in all garages. Quality of the craftmenship has been great. Buy something else if you want ugly styling or an SUV that nearly everybody has(i.e the Lexus.) This is my first BMW and I won't be going to any other brand in the future!!!
car_1856,Great car to drive,"I used to drive an Audi A4 and was unsure how the transition to a SUV would be but the X3 has not let me down!  It is wonderful, fun, comfortable and handles well.  For those of you looking for a truck that drives like a car, this is the one for you!"
car_1857,Pretty good - a few faults,Great drive and awesome performance! Had some problems with CD player and some interior finishes.  Don't lock yourself out - no way to open the doors without a key or being towed to dealership for reprogramming.  I had to break my own rear window to get into my car when I locked myself out.
car_1858,The little SUV that does it all.,This is a great little all around fun drive. It can haul my wife two large dogs and me and still have room for garden plants. With the fold down back seats and an open sun roof my wife can visit most of the garage sales in our area without having to stop to unload.
car_1859,Great SUV!!,"I've had my '04 X3 for about a year and I absolutely love it!  Fun car to drive, very reliable, great maintenance program, handles great in snow and rain and nice peppy engine for merging onto highways.  It sure beats the VW I sold to get the X3!"
car_1860,X3 BMW Beyond Expectations,"I just turned 19000 miles.  My gas mileage in light to moderate traffic is consistently between 20 and 21 mpg.  On the road the mileage is consistently between 26 to 27.5 mpg.  The handling is great; few cars handle this well!  I think the 2.5 is enough power and transmission shifts nicely.  I live in mountainous country and the 2.5 is just fine on steep grades at altitudes from 4000 to 9000 feet.  It is great in the snow, on wet roads and even muddy conditions.  The X-drive works almost instantaneously.  You can spend more but I don't think you could buy anything better.  No I don't like the clutch and break pedals so close together."
car_1861,Happy but Sore,"Have had this car for three months, and so far absolutely no complaints other than a very harsh ride with the sport package.  Believe them when they say it is harsh!!  This is not a problem at all on regular roads, but uneven pavement/ dirt roads/ speed bumps, etc are brutal.  Good handling makes it worth the sacrifice, maybe. Navigation system is a fun feature, although inputting the destination is a little time-consuming.  Some passengers have commented that it is difficult to get in and out, although I have had no problem.  Very fun commuter vehicle overall, looks great, and has a nice cargo space as a bonus!"
car_1862,"Beemer, but a step down?","I also own a 745li. This is absolutely nothing like that, of course. If you are looking for a low priced, quality, but not to any extent luxurious suv, get the X3. It is tremendous in the snow and conditions like that. The navigation system is top notch. It is extremely easy to operate, and works to perfection. DO NOT GET LEATHERETTE SEATING, I have leather and that is not comfortable either."
car_1863,A nice all-in-one package,"She wanted the height and the all-wheel drive of an SUV and I wanted the fun and spirited drive of a convertible sports sedan.  The BMW X3 exceeds all of those desires.  The driving qualities are second only to that of the BMW and Audi sports sedans, far better than any of the other SUVs we tried.  Plus, it has the added versatility of a deceivingly large cargo space and an excellent all-wheel drive system.  To top it all off, the panoramic sunroof makes it feel like a convertible.  You'd be hard pressed to find a more versitile vehicle.  Having seen the 2004 and 2005 models, the issue of interior build quality appears to have been dealt with. The X3 provides good value."
car_1864,Bimmer,"Great car, owned 5 months now, typical bimmer quirks-power locks have acted up, passenger side rear view stopped working when putting car in reverse. And, of course, I could care less since this is the best performing car for it's size i have ever driven. I love it. Of course I want more power, but this puppy is ample for sure."
car_1865,Fun in the Sun,"Very good experience.  Excellent handling and a safe drive in snow & ice.  I have about 5000 miles on the car and had no problems whatsoever.  This machine is finely engineered and does not remind me that I am in an SUV, except through its amazing x-drive and a high seating position.  In addition, with the high residual value and low leasing rates, this car is a steal, especially compared to similarly priced cars."
car_1866,Good Car,"Fun to drive great car for running around, easy access to trunk to throw things in like a 5th door."
car_1867,fun car,"Maybe not the most practical car of all time (especially if you need a lot of cargo space) but has all the features I want.  It is really fun to drive while at the same time providing some of the features of an SUV -- all wheel drive and a good view of the road.  Handles a lot better than any other SUV I've driven, including the X5.  Back seat is big enough to seat adults comfortably, which is not true of all the competition (e.g., Lexus).  And I love the huge moonroof."
car_1868,Our First Bimmer,"Our car is new, so my review is based on first impressions. The BMW X3 3.0l, is a great SUV that offers many standard option. I find the vehicle easy to drive and handle, this coming from someone who has always driven small sedans. I love the moonroof (very big) and the car key memory feature. I only have to open the car with my personal key, and the car readjusts the seat and the mirrors to my personal settings. My one con would be that the interior would look better with more wood trim then what is available."
car_1869,Best I've Owned,"Looked at the 2.5 in the 2004 model.  Waited and bought the 3.0 2005 model which included more options and priced better this second model year. This is an SUV that drives like a sedan with plenty of storage/hauling room in the back. I am very happy with the interior quality also. The handling is great... was amazing during the winter months. Would own two of these! Not only does the X3 hug the road, handle great, have great pick-up, but it is sooo much fun to drive.  If you are hestitant to buy this, don't be.. it will not disappoint."
car_1870,Great Crossover,Great performance from BMW as usual. Handles just like a 3-series. Fantastic brakes and road feel.
car_1871,BMW X3 3.0,"I have 1000 miles on the vehicle.  Not a single problem til now. The sun roof is gorgeous and unique.  Except the black bumper, the exterior design is the best in the segment, if not among all SUVs.  I find people checking my car all the time.  The performance is great for an SUV. Very confident drive in foul weather, rain sensing wipers and adaptive xenon lights help a lot.  I do not have the sport package and I find the suspension sporty and comfortable.  The transmission has excellent responses with the sport mode, however downshifts are late with the regular mode.  And it is not expensive,  I get 18-19 mpg, not bad."
car_1872,X3 is worthy of the BMW name,"If you are looking for an SUV that is big enough to haul some serious stuff, yet corners and handles well enough to keep a smile on your face, then this is the vehicle for you.  The suspension keeps the car from rolling in the corners, and the traction and stability control (both standard) keep everything firmly planted.  There is a ""sport"" suspension package available, but I didn't get it.  The 6 speed manual is the slickest I've ever driven in an SUV - it's very well matched to the in- line 6 cylinder.  The engine is sweet too, with plenty of low rev torque.  I've owned 7 new very nice sporty Japenese SUVs and liked them all.  But after driving the BMW X3, I don't think I will ever go back."
car_1873,Practical SUV and a joy to drive,"I shopped around for about a year and finally settled on the BMW X3. I would recommend the panorama sunroof and if you ride bikes, get the trailor hitch. No need for ski rack because skis fit very easily in the back. I'm getting between 20-23 mpg with regular gas. For little less than 35,000, it's a great SUV."
car_1874,Awesome,"Had the car less than a year.  With my previous car I needed a back support to drive long distances.  With the X3 I arrive at my destination fresh and ready to enjoy. It is amazing.  The driving experience is as advertised - fun.  We purchased the car because of its size, but strangely enough we have used it to move furniture, and other bulky items. so the car performs on many levels.  What is the most amazing - people actually think i paid more than the final negotiated selling price.  This is value."
car_1875,Solid fun ride,The X3 is an amazing ride. It is fun to drive and easy to handle. It has a smooth ride like a sedan. The cabin is comfortable and has a lot of neat fratures. We have had other SUV's in this class and they do not compare.
car_1876,Not as pleased as I thought I would be,"When we bought the BMW X3 (our first) we were very pleased with it.  As we drove it and got in and out of it, we were disappointed.  They put a stupid ridge that gets in your way when you try to get out of the SUV and you have to lift your feet up or trip. Same as getting in.  It's also hard to see out of when you are backing up.  Too many blinded spots and the passenger's mirror moves down when you put the SUV in reverse which can cause you not to see that well.  It is a stiff ride and god forbid you hit a speed bump too fast.  We bought the BMW X3 for the leg room, since I'm 6'4"", because I can extend my legs.  Would I buy the BMW X3 again, NO."
car_1877,Fun to drive,"This car is extremely fun to drive. Even with the 2.5l, the vehicle accelerates nicely. Handling is all BMW. While the interior is sparse, it is functional."
car_1878,Another BMW Winner,"We moved from a 3-Series to the X3 and really didn't miss a beat.  The functionality of the X3 was the biggest reason for us: hauling kids, dogs, hockey gear, ski and snow boards, groceries, etc.  I miss the ride and better grade materials from the 3-Series however and plan to order the new 325xi and give the X3 to my husband!  BMWs surpass all other cars we've owned with exceptional service, reliability, safety and incredible handling and braking.  The one thing I'd change about the X3 is the low hps in the engines.  With all the competition out there, surely BMW recognizes the need to boost the power without boosting the cost.  It shouldn't cost an extra $6K to get the 3.0."
car_1879,BMW X3,"Of the more than dozen new cars that I have owned; the BMW X3, 3.0  is the finest automobile that I have purchased. My first thousand miles have been a shear joy. If your looking for a car to get you and the family around town in, no matter what the weather is outside, then consider the X3. It has the accolades that you would expect in a BMW, (handling/performance, and quality). The X3 is a combination of cars, the sports sedan, and the SUV. BMW calls it SAV, (sport activity vehicle). However, if your looking to go off road then this my not be the SUV or SAV that your looking for. I don’t think it is “Trail Rated.”"
car_1880,BMW X3,"I really liked the BMW X3 because it was the perfect fit for a city person who somtimes goes out into the country.  It is comfortable on the road, had plenty of nice features, and it drives like a BMW should."
car_1881,great little suv,"First suv I have ever own. I was not  a fan of suvs,  but I love this vehicle. I like the size. It's easy to drive   the best handling and turning radius I have ever had in a suv or truck.  It drives like  a small car,   rides  a little stiff but not unbearable, the same as any sports car.  I love the interior layout   simple,  elegant,  straight forward,  good radio, and  great seats. Gas milage is better than I thought  I am averaging about 18  after the break in period,  mostly city driving too.  Reliability has been reat so far I can't imagine driving anything else"
car_1882,pauline's bmw,"Exciting car, fun to drive, took it cross-country starting with only 500 miles on it and it performed admirably."
car_1883,the bmwx3,"Absolutely a wonderful road care, in storms, weather just hugs the road and humes right along.  This is an auto atits best."
car_1884,I Love This BMW!,"When I was 20 (19 yrs ago) I bought a used 1973 BMW 2002 and I loved that car.  Since then I have owned many others but the most fun to drive with the most serious technology behind it is my 2004 BMW X3 3.0i.  It takes curves at full throttle like a race car without any roll/worries. I just love to drive it.  It is also a very comfortable car with a very nice fit and finish.  This is a 3 series that has  been given the blessing of X-drive and DSC and again it is a pure joy to drive (this vehicle was not designed to just haul your family around).  I again am reminded why BMW has the slogan ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"".  I would recommend an X3 to anyone who enjoys spirited driving!"
car_1885,Love the sporty X3,"An incredible machine, expensive for the interior room, but didn't buy it for cargo space.  Have put 7,000 miles on it in 6 months, absolutely no trips to the dealer for any issues whatsoever, unlike two of my friends who bought VW Toureags.  Mine is fully loaded, including the sport package which does make it stiff, but that really smoothed out at about the 4,000 mile point.  It is a joy to drive, especially here in Germany, and pull compliments out of even the most staid Germans for the great design.  Again, it was pricey compared to many US models, but compared to the X-5, with the same interior space, etc, I believe this car was a bargain.  Would buy another in a heartbeat."
car_1886,Its a BMW,"Traded in a 2003 330xi with 37,500 miles on it, for the 2005 X3 cause I needed more room. But still wanted AWD with X-Drive. Its a good safe SAV, but not a sedan. I would like it to have more power. I hope they put the 255hp Eng.in it soon. If you need a SUV thats Fun to Drive ""Its a BMW"""
car_1887,unsurpassed mechanical marvel,From the moment I sat on this sports UTE. I knew there was something special about this vehicle.
car_1888,Fun to drive,"Fun to drive. Inspiring handling, braking and acceleration. Great looking interior and exterior. Sure it's a little expensive but well worth it."
car_1889,Wunderbar,"Solid German build quality, superbly beautiful paint quality, reliable transportation, BMW expert service, decent fuel mileage, incredible sunroof opening which is the largest I have ever had, very comfortable and heated seats with (in my case the necessary) lumbar support, a wonderful stereo with rich low tones and crystal clear high tones, rich light wood accents and my wife’s favorite feature, a heated steering wheel.  This winter, we had to go to northern Ohio to pick up our son from college and despite sub zero temperatures, massive snow and seemingly impassable roads, the X3 handled it all like a genuine off road 4 wheeler in spite of all its sophisticated amenities!"
car_1890,There's a lot to love,"There really is a lot to love about the X3.  It handles beautifully, looks great and has just enough zip to get me to my boys baseball games on time and in style! I'd say overall I'd give it an A-."
car_1891,Excelent small SUV,Its a small SUV and easy to maneuver drives & runs like a sports car and function as an SUV. Luxury & style for younger drivers. Its not a box on wheels its an X3
car_1892,Fun fun fun,"After trading my 2000 3 series for a 2005 X3 3.0, I though that I would loose that BMW feel.  This car is an excellent replacement for the old 3.  The X3 is fun and crisp to drive. My only complaint on the feel is the automatic transmission.  It feels weird though - not sure - it seems to downshift late, and then when it downshifts it holds gear longer than it should, sometimes bucking.  I find Sports mode makes the car smoother."
car_1893,X3 hums,"The best looking SUV around. Tough interior that can  take some abuse. Gas mileage a bit disappointing but with its very good performance, not surprising. Superior warrrenty makes maintenance easy. Sound system is excellent. Unlike older BMWs, there are ample drink holders and good interior storage."
car_1894,X3 almost the Ultimate,"Before my X3 (3.0) I've had Audis and Volvos. The ride of the X3 is firmer and definitely more responsive--and as advertised, fun to drive. It seems to perform every bit as well as my wife's 325. The interior may not be quite as refined as an Audi but it is designed well and has a fairly decent audio system. The all-wheel drive works great. I found it to be much more comfortable in size compared to the X-5 and other of the larger SUVs. So far a real winner."
car_1895,Great SAV...,"Handles like a 3 series BMW..Great brakes, steering , etc..Typical BMW feel..Panorama Moon Roof is awesome..Excellent in bad weather, especially wet roads..Went through 15 inches of snow with ease.."
car_1896,This is a BMW?,"When reading this rating, know that I am comparing it to other BMWs.  I was greatly disappointed in pretty much everything, especially after driving a 330ci.  The X3 was a rough ride, the manual transmission felt empty, the automatic just wasn't that impressive.  The quality of the vehicle itself wasn't up to the usual level BMW offers.  The only thing that reminded me that I was driving a BMW was the symbol on the steering wheel."
car_1897,Fun to drive,"We wanted to buy a Lexus RX 330, but we decided to test drive the X3 as well. We were so amazed by the drive and the performance that we changed our mind. X3 gives you the peace of mind while driving, some undescribable sense of safety, and it has enough power to satisfy you under almost every road conditions."
car_1898,BMW X3 3.0i AWESOME RIDE!,"Drives just like a sports sedan. Handles curves great, smooth as butter and very pleasing to the eye."
car_1899,Great Car!!,"I really love this car.  If you are a fan of the squishy soft ride of American makes and lots of interior clutter marketed as luxury, this is NOT the car for you.  This car is clean and uncluttered.  It drives like a sports car!  It is a little pricey, but so are its American ""tank"" cousins cleverly disguised as SUVS and IT IS a BMW with all the engineering superiority that comes with it!!   The X3 is so solid!  The steptronic transmission is outstanding in bad weather.  It looks great and is truly a drivers car.  I can't say enough about it.  I love it!"
car_1900,BMW X3,"This is my 7th BMW and currently my ""winter BMW."" I drive a Z4 3.0 most of the year (with Dunlop winter tires for the winter: just in case I'm caught out without the X3). The X3 drives like the last 3 series sedan I owned (325i) and totally unlike any SUV. The stock Pirelli all season tires are somewhat of a compromise in the snow and on ice, but the X drive makes up for it. The trade-off is the dry weather handling, which is ""standard 3 series."" I would not consider the 18"" wheels, because of all the reports I've read and the fact that there are too many pot holes in Mass waiting to bend big rims. If you want a great combo, go for the Z4 and X3, which will exceed any one car's performance."
car_1901,"Safe, fun, good looking",With this car I have yet to have a backache.  I have the basic X3.  People think that the car cost 10k more than what i paid for it - even without leather seats.  Turning corners is a rush especially feeling very secure with the vehicle.  Can't rave enough about the steering.  My 2.5i is enough.
car_1902,Driving for fun,"BMW got the X3 just right, this car is just the most fun to drive! This compact SUV is just right the size, unlike some of those oversized monsters that hog the road, including it's oversized big brother the X5. The drive is quiet and very comfortable, and the peformance is thrilling, this baby drives! The X3 is a true BMW, the styling is a little conservative but the reeks of BMW confidence that does not need to impress, no vulgarity with this car, it does its job with style and delivers results that BMW drivers expect."
car_1903,Love my little SUV!,"I just love this little SUV! Everyone who sees my X3 asks why I don't have an X5, very snobbishly.  The fun part is when I get to reply that I do.  Well, it's my husband's car.  I had to drive his X5 while we shopped around for my car and I have to say I did not enjoy driving the X5 it was very hard to drive. It was a work out to try and turn this tank of an SUV the X5. My husband loves his X5 & all it's manly power. The X3 is very nimble and very easy to drive.  It is the ladies' BMW SUV.  And my two small children love that the sunroof opens all the way back over their car seats.  The X5 is bigger but the sun roof won't do that. Only con is small interior space. Mommy's cool car!"
car_1904,Disappointed! BMW X3,"Nice styling and handling. Poor fuel economy. Extremely cheap looking interior. Driving the X3 makes me feel that I am driving a 'Low End"" BMW. (i.e. BMW 318). It does not feel like an introductory level SUV. It feels like a ""Poor Man's Bimmer""!"
car_1905,Disapointed! BMW X3,"Nice styling and handling. Poor fuel economy. Extremely cheap looking interior. Driving the X3 makes me feel that I am driving a 'Low End"" BMW. (i.e. BMW 318). It does not feel like an introductory level SUV. It feels like a ""Poor Mans""Womens Bimmer""!"
car_1906,Fun to drive!,"I moved up from a Subaru Forester, which was a great, reliable little SUV, but no where near as much outright fun as the X3.  The X3 goes exactly where I point it, on curves and straightaways.  It accelerates smoothly and responsively, with a nice engine roar.  The only drawbacks are a rear cargo compartment that could be roomier, and a rather clunky exterior design that you either love or hate.  Fuel economy could also be improved.  But none of that matters too much to me because of the funI' having behind the wheeel."
car_1907,Glad I Waited For 05,"The 05 X3 3.0 comes in at around $2,500 less than the 04 version. Because the MSRP stayed the same, but the moonroof is now standard and the auto tranny is now a no cost option. In 04 those 2 cost about $2,500 combined. Yea, the ride is a bit stiff, but no worse than the truck I traded. Yet with the X3 there is no body lean in turns. Cornering is so much fun now, not like my wallowing truck. Gas mileage is already better (only 500 miles so far) than my old V8 truck and should get better as the engine loosens up. Even in regular drive mode it is spirited, in sport mode WOW, really quick! Great in the snow as well. I negotiated $1,750 off vs an Edmunds target price of around $400 off. Sweet!"
car_1908,Very nice SAV,"Handles better than any SUV,(SAV) Ive ever driven...Feels just like a car around turns, etc...Great in the rain and snow..Has that real road grippng BMW feel..Steerng and response are excellent and the brakes are great..Have a real safe secure feeling in it."
car_1909,Amazing X3,We purchased the X3 as a familly vehicle. We regularly transport our 2 (young) children in it. The reason we chose it is that we do not need a third row yet and we wanted as much as possible to get a vehicle that handles like a car without getting a station wagon. As you can imagine we also wanted at all costs to avoid the dreaded van. The X3 is just large enough not to feel cramped and yet remin nimble for city driving. The build quality is excellent; however the texture of the dash is questionable and the door handles could stand to look less like they were made in China. Handling is simply amazing: the truck handles like a (sports) sedan. We have found it comfortable (no sports package).
car_1910,My Review,"I have recently gotten this vehicle and I love it! I had 2 3 series before this X3, and I can't tell the difference in how it drives! It is still low enough to the ground to not feel like you're in an SUV. It handles well and is very comfortable. The design is great. I love it!"
car_1911,Not bad for the second year,Really like the car but certain interior materials should be of better quality. Rear visibility is poor so get the park distance control. The premium package is a must. Cold weather package is a must if you live in cold climate. Exterior is well thought out with no painted surfaces on the lower part of the body. Storage space is lacking. If you have an iPod get the connector installed. The bluetooth does not work with the Motorola V710 phone with Verizon Wireless. There are rumors of a software fix.
car_1912,New to BMW and loving it!,Great driving experience.  Respectable power on 2.5 liter 6-speed.  Feels like more power than what it's rated at.
car_1913,BY ENGINEER,"I traded in my 04 X-3 for this 05 - and yes, I like them that much! Once you get hooked on the outstanding build quality nothing else compares. And the performance of this turbine smooth 3.0 engine coupled with so many built in occupant safety features puts this SUV way ahead of any other choices I reviewed. Sit in one - don't even drive it - look around then turn the key on and watch it come to life just waiting for you to guide it and show what you want. It's there for you and years from now it still will be and with one of the highest resale values on the market. Guess you can tell I like this ride. Take one out - get close to it and you'll want to write something too."
car_1914,Looks and feels good,"For a combo of city and rural driving where snow is sometimes a factor, X-3 was the choice for me.  So far, it performs reliably.  Lots of fun to drive, for an SUV.  Roomy, but not impossible to park in the city."
car_1915,"""Everything""","After years of waiting for just the right time, I have finally purchased my first BMW. I must say the X3 automobile is everything I imagined it could be. With just under a thousand miles total, I have found the car to be responsive in every aspect of driving. The gas milage continues to exceed the norm  making the driving experience even more fun. For those of you waiting as I did, wait no longer, this automobile is ""everything"" you imagined it could be!"
car_1916,Just fantastic,"I love this vehicle.  If you like the squishy soft ride of a Cadillac or Merc and like lots of interior clutter marketed as ""luxury"", this is NOT the vehicle for you.  The X3 has a clean, elegant, uncluttered look inside and out.  It is so fun to drive!  It handles like a sports car but is great! in the rain & snow.  Just superior as far as engineering and performance.  I never thought I'd own a BMW... but I will be hard pressed to go back.  It is a little pricey, but so are the American tanks cleverly disguised as SUVs. Nothing against American cars.  The RX is simply for a different market.  I looked at the Japanese SUVs as well and really like them too, but I fell in love with the X3."
car_1917,Awesome SUV,We liked the first one so much that we went out and got another. Different colors of course.
car_1918,Excellent,Drives like a dream.  The inside is a little small but sufficient for a family of 4.
car_1919,Driving the Best,"I have owner Mercedes M Class, and Porcshe 944 as well as first 64 Mustang...needing an SUV due to reisidng in the mountains...my wife and I drove 20 different vehicles, before selecting this one. The second to start to drive it, you are impressed with the tightness, it feels like you are driving a sports car. Plenty of pep, and over all enjoyable ride."
car_1920,BMW X3,"Not only is it a great looking vehicle, it performs like A BMW should. Acceleration, handling,comfort and braking are exactly like the whole line of BMW vehicles. After driving all the competitive SUV's, which were like a ""Vanilla ice cream cone"", the X3 was like a"" deluxe bannana split""."
car_1921,Not good,Not a good experiance for what I paid for this crappy car. I think A hynduai santa fe has the same cheap looking interior of the the bmw x3. Plus a hynduai has a better warrenty
car_1922,"A bit pricy, but fun to drive.","I never thought I would purchase a BMW. While delivering some documents to the dealer, the owner of the dealership took me out for a test drive during a heavy downpour. The X3 handled like a champ! It performed like a sports car ... it feels like one."
car_1923,Great little SUV,This ute is a blast to drive. It handles great and is pretty darn fast. The interior is surprisingly roomy and the back seat is comfy for 3 adults.
car_1924,The Sport is the Best,"We went for the 3.0 sport and are very happy.  We have heard complaints that the sport rides too stiff and bucks, all I can say is it the most fun I have ever had with an SUV.  I have owned two Lexus RX 300's which honestly drive like a minivan compared to the X3. The X3 has a great sporty interior which in my book is of better quality and and design than the new Lexus RX 330 (which was the other car we were considering). With the deal we got from BMW we received much more car for our money than with a Lexus."
car_1925,BMW X3,"At first I was skeptical to this SUV. With only 184bhp and a large body I was seriously considering a 325xi.  However, the new body style, lower price and test drive of the X3 had me sold. It has a turnk the size of an X5 but drives like a 3 Series. The steering and suspension are tight but not harsh and if you really push it, the X3 hustles."
car_1926,If you need or want AWD,"Try to find a vehicle out there with AWD that has the utility of an SUV and the handling of a sports car.  Unlike the 3 series, it actually has a back seat.  And, it sits up just high enough to give you a commanding view of the road.  You get BMW handling and quality in a perfect sized package."
car_1927,A driver's small sport ute!,"We just recently had a baby and had grown out of our 330i. After looking at the crossover market and driving a few (Infiniti FX, Lexus RX, etc.) the Beemer won hands down on driveability and function. The SUV drives just like our previous 3 series, but has some decent cargo space and all wheel.  We have a larger SUV family truckster and vowed to never drive a mini-van. So now we have the best of both worlds with the X3.  A little pricey, but worth it if you want nimble utility."
car_1928,First time BMW owner impressed,"I've been driving Mercedes-Benz for over 9 years and decided to test BMW mainly because of the full warranty and the special lease promotion. I was impressed with the X3 due because it's not a massive SUV, has more space than a sedan and is all wheel drive. I was suprised at how comfortable and easy to operate all the little things. I'm really impressed with the acceleration from a complete stop. The ride is really smooth as well. Impressive safty features, and getting used to driving a SAV took about 3-5 days. Get one... you won't be sorry!"
car_1929,Fits the bill!,"I bought an X3 because where I live the roads are terrible and it snows.  If you need an SUV, but love to drive a sports car, this is a good alternative.  The all-wheel drive is amazing.  And it is smaller than the X-5, which if you live in the city, is a pain to park!"
car_1930,The Dream Machine,"This is an awesome car.  From the time you unlock it to the time you lock it and walk away, you are guarenteed sheer joy.  The car has so many dependability control and saftey features that it allows you to spend time focusing on the comfort and entertainment.  There is no shortage of that.  The ride is not too stiff (improved in '05) and I like the interior (light wood = the best).  The vehichle is very sophisticated if you equip it properly (please do).  If you just want a dependable car to drive, there are others out there.  If you will stand for nothing less than the best...name, engine, looks, entertaining and futuristic features, then equip one fully and join the club."
car_1931,x3 blue,This car is very fun for anyone. Its good for off roading and everyday use. It has alot of room on the inside.
car_1932,X3,"This is my first ""high performance"" vehicle. I am enjoying the driving experience in a vehicle that allows me to still have the carrying capacity that I need. My previous SUV was a Trailblazer. These two are so different you really can not compare them. I am definitely hooked on a BMW."
car_1933,It's an OK Vehicle,"I recently leased a BMW X3. The vehicles is nice. But BMW could give you more standard features. One example is Fog Lights which cheaper SUVs have as standard equipment and cruise control. Come on BMW engineers this is a BMW not a KIA or Hyundai. You even have a space on the bumper that looks like fog lights. I already got stuck with the car it wouldn't start with only 1500 miles on it. The BMW road service had to flat bed the car and bring it back to the dealer. The dealer tried to talk me out of a loaner. I got a loaner finally, a Toyota Camry which was ok. When I got the BMW back they did not replace the little cover on the bumper used for towing and it was dirty. Is that BMW service?"
car_1934,X3 Owner,"I have owned the 2005 X3 for about a month and I have truly enjoyed the comfort and solid performance. The 3 liter engine is responsive with 225 horsepower. The interior is very comfortable, even with 4 adults, but could use more storage space. Panoramic sunroof is great on the 2 trips I've taken with it. The automatic transmission has the ability to shift as a manual is a great feature when driving in the city. Overall very pleased."
car_1935,ALL GOOD,The X3 drives like a car instead of a truck.  I have the 2.5 liter and it is sufficient for the type of vehicle that it is.  The quality is exceptional.  BMW's are some of the best built cars in the world and this vehicle reflects that.
car_1936,A Non-Truck!,"I am not a big fan of SUV's, but finally needed something larger than my car. This baby does the trick! Styling, versatility, comfort, and performance all rolled into one! Inside you don't have the feeling of being in a truck or mini-van. Outside, there's no mistaking it for a pick-up with a cap. With the 3.0 liter engine you fly and if you feel sporty, the 5-speed automatic lets you shift manually. Between the roof rack, trailer hitch, and cargo bay you can put your bicycles on top, out back, or inside! It may not be enough room for a party of six, but it's more than enough for a couple or small family. Only knock is that the AWD gets 16MPG around town and requires premium gas only."
car_1937,X3 Worth the Ride,The ride and feeling of safety / security is something to be expierienced.
car_1938,BMW Makes it happen !,"What happens when you want a sports car but need an SUV ? Why you get a BMW of course! But why? While its true that one cost more then some other models in the same class you'll truly get what you pay for. The fit, finish and feel of this SUV along with its power and handling make it a car you'll love to drive day in and day out. It's reliablity has been excellent and I look forward to many years of great service."
car_1939,4 months experience with BMW  X3,"I was not thrilled with all the gadgetry I had to learn until one day I spotted the low tire pressure icon on the display. Sure enough, I had picked up a nail and the pressure in one tire was down about three pounds. The slow leak was not enough to keep me from driving to a repair place without changing the tire first. Without the display I might not have known until too late to save the tire. The vehicle is peppy and handles like a sports car even with the smaller 6- cylinder engine."
car_1940,640i review,Need to put better tires. Have had blowouts on 3 of the 4 tires and only10000 miles.Still tires are the issue!! Performance is the best for the money. Good overall value
car_1941,Nice Car Turns into a Nightmare!,"The engine in my 2016 BMW 435i literally blew-up and now BMW is refusing to honor the warranty. The repair shop claims they found water spots in the air intake plenum. They claim that due to recent heavy rains and driving through ""a puddle"" 5 weeks earlier caused a piston connecting rod to break through the side of the engine block! This is even though the car ran perfectly for the entire 5 week period and 2500 miles after the rain event without even the slightest vibration. What they couldn't explain, at all, was how enough water made it past the air cleaner without getting the air cleaner wet or damaged! The rain event did short a couple electronic systems as error codes indicated and put the car into a ""limp-home"" mode, but were simply cleared and reset after I had them checked. Interestingly, the service advisor and a service manager kept aggressively encouraging me to ""just file a claim with your insurance carrier"" and that ""people have been doing it there all the time""! It seemed like a ""go-to"" line for these guys even though any competent mechanic would conclude that this engine did not ""blow"" due to water damage! I checked with a few!  It has been my experience here that BMW, through their authorized representatives, will do anything possible to avoid responsibility in honoring their warranty including encouraging their customers to commit insurance fraud. At least this was the ""feeling"" I was left with after my conversations with the service staff at the particular BMW dealer in Long Beach, California."
car_1942,Every 2Dr Sports Coupe should be this good,"Definitely go for the x-Drive all wheel drive option, even in Southern states, as the almost .5 second 0-60 improvement over the rear-wheel drive model is more than worth it.  Plus the all wheel drive provides you with the best winter driving traction and control that you can get."
car_1943,Fast&Great Handling,"Made extremely well. The rear wheel drive has fantastic handling; car flat with no lean on curves. Seats are very comfortable on a long trip and have good support. Comfort Mode drives great, Sport Mode is very high performance. Electronics are very effective and intuitive. Trunk is narrow and small."
car_1944,Sun! Breezes! Fun!,"Fun to drive. Hugs the road in comfort mode and sports mode is even more fun. Love the sport seats--the extension makes it so comfortable for my long legs. The electronics aren't that intuitive--I'm learning but all the dealers have ""BMW Geniuses"" on staff to train you--I just haven't had the time yet to go in. Only disappointment is that mine doesn't have the premium package, which means I don't have keyless entry like I'm used to. Not a huge deal--just don't like having to dig for my keys all the time."
car_1945,Estoril blue beauty,"In my honeymoon phase.  Drove out of state to PA to pick up this totally loaded 2016 435i X drive.  I test drove the 4 cylinder. Trading in my 335,  I wasn't happy driving the 4. It was sluggish and heavy. Not with the v6.   Highly recommend the M Sport package.  This car was loaded ( MSport, Nav, surround cameras, entertainment, etc) with everything I would have ordered,  except the price and financing couldn't be matched by waiting on a 2017.  It truly is the best of both worlds. Top up zero noise. Top down, wow! :-).  If you can still find a 2016, equipped the way you want, then buy it. The warranty is longer, too. BMW moved to 3 years for 2017."

car_1949,428i gran coupe 2016,"I bought 428i gran coupe a month ago, drove it for nearly 1000 miles, this car is a beast on the roads especially when you activate the sport  mode you feel the car is roaring and eager for your push on the gas pedal.....handling and steering feedback is perfect, I used to have Mazda 6, honda civic, Kia sportage, Hyundai....This car is from another realm, if you are a type of guys that like fun in driving, acceleration and sharp turns then this car is for you....Add to that a great gas mileage for the power it generates. Around 27 mpg combined.My advice to you is that if you like to own the car until it dies then spend extra bucks on getting technology package (with head up display feature), premium package which adds a lot of conveniece, rear view camera, and if you live in cold area then add a winter package, believe me it worth every penny....It is a luxury sport car with acceptable cost and looks much better than 3 series ... If you are into luxury and do not care about fun in driving or if your budget is limited then search for a lower class cars.... (some new kia cars looks more luxurious from inside than my BMW, but driving and controlling is none compared to BMW)......BTW, if you have a family with big dudes (6'1 and above), then rear seating might become an issue....."
car_1950,Ultimate driving machine - for real,"This is our fifth BMW. Drove 3 series while we had kids at home. Then got a 1-series that was a blast to drive - handled like go-kart. Decided to go for the 428 instead of the 228. We got a 428i with a manual transmission. What a great car. Great handling and acceleration. Really nice transmission. A dream car on country roads. Took it up to Vermont on backroads and couldn't stop smiling. Quite and smooth on highways. Usually drive it in Sport mode - which makes a noticeable difference. The rear seat is big enough for adults, especially around town or for an hour or so. The 2016 model has so many great standard features. We don't care about GPS because we use our iPhones, so we didn't get that package. Just added heated seat/steering wheel. Makes it a great value if you don't load up on the options. Beautiful looking car with great lines. Many people comment on how great it looks. The Ultimate Driving Machine... and I don't work for BMW."

car_1952,Love BMWS - First Hardtop Convertible,"My fifth newly purchased BMW and this time I was looking for a convertible.  I narrowed my results to the Porsche Boxster or a BMW (4 Series or up...bigger guy).  I choose the BMW based on consumer and expert reviews, the hardtop opposed to soft top, and I love the four year no hassle warranty/service with these cars.  I may have went for the 6 cylinder (435i) because I prefer the power (as in past BMWs) but my wife owns a newer 328i and when in sport mode, I'm satisfied. Same case here - I have all the packages except cold weather (does have heated seats) including the 'M' package. More active suspension and acceleration....handles great.  Setting the level here though...this vehicle has so much technology that after reading the manual a couple of times, I still had a few questions for the dealership.  I'm a technology professional by trade so that appeals to me but for the non-tech types, the technology and/or communications package may be overkill since you'll probably never use the services.  My parents own an X5, are not tech savvy and barely use all the features available...just a point to consider. Overall, I'll probably drive BMWs for a very long time because I trust the product and the backend support/service.  One more note - I live in Central Florida so the chance to ride topless is pretty much year round hence desiring a convertible."
car_1953,Lots of fun in a ride!,"This is a great car for anyone who rarely uses the back seat.  The optional M sports package gives the car peppy acceleration and tight handling, making it everything BMW drivers live about the cars!  But for 5 series owners, the car seemed a little too crowded in the arm rest and lacked the thigh support seats that make long rides comfortable.    You have to add anther premium option package to get the comfy seats 5 series drivers expect."
car_1954,A true BMW Marvel,"A true luxury with comfort, class and excellent dynamics. The 4 series is a piece of art, technology, comfort and excellent dynamics."
car_1955,Fun Car,"The convertible is fun to drive in good weather with the top down. What pleasantly surprised me is how comfortable the car is in cold weather. With heated seats, the hardtop convertible feels warm and delightful on cold days.Update: Now that I have had the car for 9 months, my appreciation for the car has grown. Except for a small glitch on one day (which was corrected in one visit by the dealer), the car has been very pleasurable to own and drive. I am glad I bought it. I am proud to drive it and show it to my friends. My friends like it too. One of my friends said it was the most exciting car he had ever seen.The BMW dealership has given me nice loaner cars when I brought my car in for maintenance, e.g. a beautiful BMW convertible."
car_1956,"Possibly the best convertible ""sporty"" car today!","Overall, this is the best convertible I have ever owned, and I have owned 7 convertibles prior to this purchase, one of which was an outstanding 2005 BMW 330ci convertible!  I traded in a 2013 Audi A6 and 2008 Porsche Boxster for this car, trying to get a combination that best reflected those 2 cars combined.  The BMW is not a sports car, nor is it intended to be, but it has the feel of one!  It is by far the quietest convertible I have owned, measured both by top up and down.  The wind reflector really helps, but it only works with people in the front seats.  The back seats are ""adequate"" for adults around town, but not for long trips.  The heated neck ventilator is wonderful anytime it is below 68 degrees.  I deeply value a strong sound system, particularly with the top down, and the Harman Kardon system does not disappoint.  We have taken several 7 hour plus trips, and it is very comfortable on the long trips, top up or down.  The engine and transmission are smooth and powerful, and they are more than 90% of the owners would ever want or need.  I loved my 2005 BMW, but this car is much sleeker, with a larger and more comfortable interior.  The trunk and fold down rear seat are outstanding with the top up, and more that adequate when down.  We comfortably took a week long trip to the beach with beach chairs and top down, which you couldn't do in most hard top convertibles.   I have the following criticisms:  1)  A luxury convertible should have available ventilated seats, and they are NOT an option, 2)  the navigation and sound system are not as intuitive or efficient as in the Audi, and 3)  the climate control is not fully automatic, it requires you to manually adjust the fan's speed and vent direction.  Overall, these are minor detractors, but changes BMW needs to make in this car.  I have owned the car for 5 months, and I truly love driving it and am fully pleased with my purchase, and confidently recommend this car if it is what you are seeking!"
car_1957,Makes me happy on every drive,"Buy it 2-3 years,old, same car much cheaper. Mpackage, adaptive headlights, blind spot assist, heads up display, lane assist are musts"
car_1958,Head turner,I leased this car to be my fun car.  It is turning out to be my daily driver.  All wheel drive convertible.  I ordered it this way.  Worth the 90 day wait.  I love the heads up display and apple play.  I have owned most premium cars and this is at the top of the list for me.  For the dollar it is more than worth it compared to the Maserati and Mercedes.
car_1959,A BMW Boat...,"I am a big fan of BMW and have had several of their models in the past and still have a 118d in the UK and an X5 from the same year, but I have to say that I was not a fan of this particular car will not be renewing my lease.  It accelerates and brakes fantastically and has a surprisingly roomy trunk for weekend trips.  There was also plenty of headroom for my 6'1"" body and with the 17,000 miles I've had this car there were no issues with it and it was plenty fuel efficient.  It'll also do 110 mph on a straight highway all day long and it's quiet for a convertible.  But either because of it's enormous weight (over 4,200 pounds) or the fact that it is a convertible and thus not as stiff, no matter what mode the car is in the car is really too wobbly and you feel this from lane changes, slightly twisty roads, and definitely on mountain roads.  Because of this, I feel this is more of a highway cruiser than a sports car, I wouldn't even call it sporty.  It rolls around like a boat and I hated the way the car felt when the road even got remotely twisty.  Another thing that takes away from the sporty DNA I typically associate with BMW is the fact that the it has BMW's fantastic new 8-Speed transmission, but you really have no idea what the engine is doing because you could barely feel or hear the engine.  I also had major gripes with the value because besides the LCD dashboard screen, the interior didn't feel any bit as different as the interior of my X5 from the same year, which was much cheaper and has the same engine.  The X5 even had a plus on this thing because it had these interior mood lights which made you feel like you were in a nightclub or something.  The entertainment was also the same in that the stereo wasn't any better, and there weren't any more features as what I could work out.  Overall I thought this car was fast and comfortable on a highway, dependable and efficient, but also too expensive, boring, and the handling is terrible."
car_1960,Car of my dreams,"What more can a guy want?? Red 640I xDrive convertable.... every gadget and a wolf in sheeps clothing. Luxurious , heavy head turner. Haven't seen another on the road in over a week. Rare ??? expensive !  Love driving it. Very comfortable front seats and decent trunk space. Stereo is OK but I've had better. The digital display is amazing watching the entire display turn fire engine red when placed in sport or sport plus. The exhaust sings.... push me . Like I said car of my dreams. Perfect mid life crisis automobile... Oh I'm amazed at the MPG. So far about 29    Still smilingAfter owning for 5 months. Car takes time to warm up when weather is cold. Though the heat goes on right away  and blows cold air. Heated steering wheel is a major plus. When it rains and it gets cold the gas cap freezes and can't open until it warms up. Getting in and out can be a circus act as the seats sit very low but fine once your in the car. Finish is still perfect even after a few months of cold weather of ice and snow. Car can get up and go with little effort. In 5 months I've still only seen a handful on the road.  Still smiling."

car_1964,Headsup Fabulous,"This is one sweet automobile. So responsive, amazing comfort in the driver's seat ( great lumbar and head support). And the headsup display is invaluable - what a car.  Can't wait to really get it on the road for a trip.  Love it, love it, love it."
car_1965,650 convertible 2008,"I had the 650 for 12 months and I regret getting it: Too much money for what you get. I paid $90K+, includes: conv, auto, sports pckg, head-up display is an absolutely stupid option, convenience key is not necessary and HD radio that never worked right; dealer said it works best in the city but not in the suburbs where I live, thx and heated seats. I could have gotten a better car for $90K or a great car at a much lower price but not $90K+ for 360 HP. This is my 3rd BMW; I have a 01-740i and a 05-330cic; both are great but the 650 at this price level is a disappointment, not only in lack of HP but in technology/computer etc. Take your time, compare and shop wisely before you commit to a 650."
car_1966,Fun to Drive,"I have had lots of cars in my life, including MBs, other BMWs, a Porsche but none have been more fun to drive or more luxurious. The 6spd manual is terrific and the sport mode just adds a little more sports car feel. The iDrive complaints I've heard don't register with me. In less than a day, my phone was working with bt, I was using voice commands and the navigation system. This car is a head turner and all the gadgets are fun to play with, including the convertible top. I also like the throaty sound, especially in sports mode. There is no question that the backseat is next to useless but I intend to use this car as a two-seater any way."
car_1967,What a beauty,"This is by far my favorite car. The handling and power are outstanding. With the top dropped, my passion for driving fast can be fully realized. I would highly recommend this car to anyone who enjoys open air driving."
car_1968,What a Kick,Got an '08 Sapphire Black convertible with saddle leather. Awesome to drive. Extremely responsive steering and brakes. Doesn't feel like the heavy car that it is. Ample power and acceleration through all gears although could be quicker off the line. First time user of iDrive and find it to be much more intuitive then car magazine editor's complaints. Fuel economy is better then expected. Getting 26+ mpg on highways with 18 in city driving. Interior noise is also better then expected. The back panel window really cuts down on both noise and turbulence. Only complaint is that the rear speakers seem to be under amped and some navigational clumsiness between iDrive commands.
car_1969,Can't believe it is mine,"Custom made  for me, in Germany this year. It is truly beautiful. I ordered the saddle color seats. It is truly the best choice in convertibles and when the top is up and your on the highway so quiet you think you are in a hardtop."
car_1970,Adult Rollercoaster,"Take 1 drive in this puppy, and you will realize why they call it the ultimate driving machine. By far the most fun I have had driving a car. Eats a lot of gas, the backseat is for looks not for passengers."
car_1971,You Won't Regret it!,"Agonized many a times about spending this kind of $ for a car.   After 1 week of driving it, this machine is worth every dollar, not only in its performance and peerless handling, but in the way it makes you feel when you are behind the wheel.  Extreme luxury, awsome handle, superb sports performance, plus the WOW! factor; all in one package."
car_1972,Beautiful Car,"I haven't owned a convertible in years so I thought it was time.  I added the sport package, upgraded sound system and 21"" chrome wheels.  The car is stunning.  I get comments and looks constantly, especially when the top is down.  There is still not enough storage space inside the vehicle.  Glove box is small, center console storage is small.  Owner's manual(s) don't even fit in the glove box.  There are no cupholders in the front.  But for styling, power, comfort, and electronic amenities, this is a great car.  This is a true driver's car."
car_1973,Subtle changes make a difference,"After much deliberation, I bought a new 650i coupe. I always liked it generally, but could not imagine a car at this price without an opening sunroof. You have to drive it to understand that the trade off is a beautiful panoramic experience through the roof glass with ventilation still available. The trunk area, which I always saw as ugly Bangle bungling, is subtly changed and now much more acceptable to me. The brake light previously near the back window is now integrated into the deck lid. It just looks better. People really rubber neck; a nice extra."
car_1974,awesome,"the ultimate driving machine even for an SUV. love this car!! the way it drives and handles, awesome! ! If you love to drive .then BMW is the car for you! I have had it almost a year, bought it with 80,000 Miles, it has 95,000 now and it runs great.. car also handles very well in snow..I do know they are expensive to work on, I did buy a warranty and had to use it once....save me $600....so far so good with Warranty Direct"
car_1975,Best in class,"My BMW X3 seems to beg to be driven. It seems to be engineered to perform. The 6 cylinder has been very strong to have 130,000 miles on it. I would recommend anyone in the market for a suv to explore this option."
car_1976,fun to drive and reliable,"Its definitely not a luxury vehicle. It fun to drive. I live in a hilly city and this little baby just wips around the curves. The leather seats are horrible. Im use to better quality. I also live in extreme heat so the seats make everyone sweat. I wish it had more cup holders. The one on the passenger side is broke. Its cheap plastic. I will say I have 185000 miles on this baby. Its paid for and its mine. Its gotten me everywhere I need to go and Im grateful. My mechanic says it will run forever. It cost a lot when it needs something but as far as reliable ,well  Its on top The sun roof cover wont close all the way.I have to many miles to care. I'm giving it to my daughter and getting a newer suv. Just not sure what. I thought I would write a review since Im looking for a new suv and the smaller ones are not getting great reviews. To sum it up this baby has been worth it but I want more luxury. Have not had any complaints about the bigger suvs I have owned. Oh except gas mileage. Hope this helpshere is an update. Gave this car to my daughter going to college. She loves it and its safe. I bought myself a Lexus SUV and I LOVE it. Cant go wrong. My first review sums it up."
car_1977,Great car but repairs are expensive.,"Bought this car in 2009 and have nearly 100k miles.  It has been a great car but you need to be aware of some expensive repairs that will be needed.  Started leaking oil at 80K miles.  $600 to repair 2 seals at private mechanic, $1,200 dealer quote.  Broken rear springs at 80K, $600 at private mechanic, $1200 dealer quote. Replaced passenger front seat due to airbag sensor problem $0 under extended warranty.  Bottom line, get a good private mechanic if you want to keep your X3 long term.  ALL BMWS HAVE THESE SAME PROBLEMS. Dealer repair prices are a rip off.  You have to pay for the lush showrooms. All cars these days are meant to be leased and turned in before any manufacturing problems show up.In my opinion Acuras are more reliable but don't handle as well.Now problems with trim are showing up. Door handle cable broke and plastic map case latch broke. Still a good driving car."
car_1978,Manual transmission and Sunroof,"My wife and I traded in our car with our baby on the way and wanted an SUV that had both a manual transmission and a sun roof.NO new cars come with both so We picked up our 2006 X3 with 68K and now have about 77K after almost a year and absolutely love it!The storage in the back is a little tight but the movable tie downs are great.We ended up buying the crossbars for the roof so we can put a cargo box on top for our annually beach vacation.Worked wonderfully.Gas mileage has been pretty good, with summer gas and a trip to north western pa (No roof rack) we managed between 25-26mpg 85-90% highway. Around town we get anywhere from 18-21, depending on who's driving."
car_1979,Very good CPO Buy,"I bought this 4 yr old X3 in August and so far it is a very good small suv. The tranny is ultra smooth, the engine is smooth & torquey. Steering is BMW excellent. Build quality is very good. Consumer Reports gives it a best buy for the '06 yr & good reliability or I wouldn't have purchased it. So far no problems. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good used suv in the $20K-$25K range"
car_1980,Top SUV,"If you enjoy speed with a dash of mobility, flexibility, security and don't have a lot of commitment in life except to be with your love ones to include all your pets. This is the vehicle to get. Perfect size and comfort for the couple and/or some that just wanna go out and play some more."
car_1981,Why had I been driving anything else?,"After 130K in a Pathfinder, I was looking for something a little more sporty, solid, fun to drive but still large to haul kids.  Looked at a lot of replacement options but fell in love with the X3 about five minutes off the dealer lot in a test drive.  Transmission is great.  Smooth ride.  It's hard to take my foot off the accelerator.  Only complaint is the weird/basic radio system and ""always on"" lighter outlets.  Hate to replace the radio with an aftermarket, but I need satellite radio, USB port for I- pod and an AUX port.  Just learned today that they have discontinued production on Sirius receivers for the factory radio.  I'm going to put the Ipod/AUX ports up in the top dash compartment."
car_1982,"After 3 year lease, had to buy it!","After 35K miles, my assessment of this well-designed vehicle is you get what you pay for. It is not a sports car, so don't expect it to drive like a 3 series sedan, but then again, it doesn't drive like a truck either. The handling is still more impressive than a lot of cars, especially considering it's an SUV (er, sorry BMW marketing guys... ""SAV""). It's not a luxury car, so don't buy it if you're looking for a smooth, refined ride. However, if you want something that is truly fun to drive, yet also has a practical side (meaning you can actually give rides to adults and shop at The Home Depot) the X3 is a great choice. I constantly get genuine compliments from friends who own luxury sedans."
car_1983,It is all in the engineering! No frills,"I have owned this car for 14 months. One trip to the dealership for leaking oil was quickly resolved. Driving this car over 80 mph, winding roads or bad weather is where you  really appreciate and enjoy this car and its capabilities. It handles extremely well. I feel very safe driving this car."
car_1984,Love My X3!,"This is a great SUV. This is my first BMW but I have driven many other luxury SUVs. By the way I was torn between this and the X5. I am glad that I chose this one. Better pricing and, believe it or not, a lot more cargo space in height area. Smooth ride. People are always amazed when they get in my truck because it is much bigger on the inside than it looks. Very spacious! Just put 18K on my baby. I love to drive this truck!"
car_1985,"Great ride, but...","I have the X3 now for one year and love the way it handles. It does have a light hesitation, which is rather annoying (automatic transmission). My beef is with the electronics: the in-dash MP3 player is very touchy. My newer MP3 CDs didn't play at all (but they played in another BMW). Now I only get the ""CD Check"" 1/3 of the time, which means it can't read the CD. I had it looked at but they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Then the telephone function disappeared from my display.  Also, the navigation is always off. Sometimes I'm 50 feet in the boonies off the road, and the list goes on."
car_1986,BMW fan buys another good one,"This is my 7th BMW and I purchased this one pre-owned with about 10k miles on it. It is a great vehicle, handle like my 330ci and is really quick! Great view of the road, great long distance car also. Mileage is just ok, but that's to be expected of an AWD vehicle. Very safe for my wife and two kids under 2 yrs old! Confident and comfortable! Always enjoy ownership experience with BMWs - total ownership with no additional out of pocket expenses makes life easy!!"
car_1987,06 X3,"After 1 year and 12000 miles of ownership the newness has worn off, but the performance remains.  This is the best handling vehicle I have ever owned.  Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.  The price is high, but it is a BMW and leasing incentives make owning this vehicle very affordable for the first 3 years.  Problems:  radio display is malfunctioning (LCD screen is all messed up) and a replacement has been on order for over 1 month; recently have started to experience the door sqeaking or rattling when the windows are rolled up.  Also have an annoying headliner rattle above the drivers seat.  Hope to have these issues resolved when the new radio arrives.  Overall, still very happy."
car_1988,2006 X3 problematic,"I have had nothing but problems with my X3. The software for the bluetooth phone and GPS had to be reloaded several times because it starts acting flaky and eventually just dies every 3-4 months. The GPS has the worst user interface I have ever seen. The bluetooth phonebook interface is horrible if you have a PDA. The iPod adapter is useless (does not display artist or title). The main issue, though, is the transmission. It's jerky, especially when going uphill or passing on a highway. Also, the gas mileage is way below what they advertise."
car_1989,Perfection,What a great SAV. BMW hit the nail on the head with this one.  The only downside to the car is the fuel efficency.  Other than that I wouldnt change a thing.
car_1990,Great SUV... could get a little better mpg,Fantasic automobile.  No problems in first 6 months/8k miles of ownership.
car_1991,06 X3,"First let me say how impressed I was with the handling of this SAV.  Coming from an M Coupe I was not expecting a vehicle of this size to handle so well.  The only problem is the ride is very stiff- making driving on some roads downright painful.  The design is excellent, very solid and additional features- bluetoot and MP3 inputs were a plus.  And the heated steering wheel- very nice here in NY."
car_1992,Improvements,"Has some improvements over my '04 X3. Servotronic steering is nice in parking lots, but dampens the road feel somewhat. It seems to wander around. Ride is much softer than '04, so it feels like it leans a bit more on corners, but still holds the road. Too many people complained that it drove like a BMW, I guess. This is supposed to be a sports car, not a Benz. Transmission program is better; smoother shift to 2nd gear. (Auto Trans.) The '04 would sometimes hold on to 1st gear then slam into 2nd. Overall, I love this vehicle and BMW in general."
car_1993,Over 40?,"This is my 3rd BMW and I would get it all over again; I love the bluetooh capability since I am on the phone most of the time. Over 40? Well, this guy would make feel 20 again without driving the typical and larger dad's SUV but with big enough cargo space than most SUVs. This guy was built to perform - you will be satisfied."
car_1994,Overall Great Car,"I went from the 325i to X3 and have overall been pleased.  Minor issues are only one cup holder in middle; many come stock with fake leather- it looks terrible and doesn't wear well either.  Go for the REAL THING! It does feel more like a sports vehicle than luxury. But, it's fun to drive!"
car_1995,BMW X3,One heck of great car to drive. Solid and very responsive. Not like the usual SUVs. No problems at all so far.
car_1996,On top as usual,"Well, it's no surprise that the X3 has not let me down. It is, as with every BMW offered, the best in its class. No other SUV can touch the X3 mainly because it's an SAV... there's a huge difference.  Homerun! The only other small SUV I'd own is an 07 X3!!"
car_1997,I still love it,"I purchased this car in Germany and have had it up to 120 mph on the autobahn.  even at that speed it handled like a dream.  it seems to get its best mileage at around 70 mph on the highway.  My last vehicle was a Nissan Pathfinder and I thought I would miss the extra space that it provided.  I have had no issues with the cargo room with this car, even with two small children."
car_1998,Great SAV/SUV!!!,This is the best car I've bought so far. I love this car. It is really a luxury car with the capabilities of a sports and utility vehicle but small for easy loading and driving.
car_1999,2006 BMW X3,"If you want the smoothest x3 ride avoid the sport package and stick with the 17"" higher profile tires.  The handling is still great.  This is all the advantages of a truck in a package that drives like a sports car.  Nav system is easy to use and  pops up out of the top of the dash.  Upgraded sound sytem sould be a little better but isn't bad.  Seats and driving position are great but the bottom line is the x3 is just plain old fun to drive."
car_2000,BMW X3,"Handling as good as a sports car. Rear seats are way too rigid - not comfortable at all. This car is for city drive, not a real off-roader."
car_2001,2006 X3,"The X3 is one of the best cars I've ever had and I've had a lot. The only complaint is its gas mileage which I know can be better. Other than that the care is very well built.  The aluminum wheels also need to get better, they pit very easily."
car_2002,I love it!,"It's the best investment I made in years!! It's a great car for my son and me. Lots of space. I had lots of different cars in the past as well as driven other cars, but this car handles the road very well! Within the next 5 years my next purchase will be the 5-series."
car_2003,Great SAV - BUT......,"Bought my 2006 BMW X3 3.0i AWD here in Germany - beautiful vehicle with surprisingly useful amenities - (i.e. partial opening sun-roof shade for ventilation when closed). Drives wonderfully, handles well & looks great (blue)... however BMW makes you purchase almost EVERY option they make. The only exception are the options finally included from previous years. I drove my SAV 2,000 miles in 10 days around Germany, Italy & France through the Alps & even hit snow in June! It drove great, but only averaged about 20 MPG. My 1989 BMW 735i with 120,000 miles on it averaged 21 MPG. You'd think they would make an engine with better MPG in 17 years! NAV is slow and easily confused - Road noise is LOUD.  Autobahn speeds of 120 MPH - you had to almost YELL in the car!! Windy, forget talking!"
car_2004,Wonderful,I owned a 325xi which was a great car but this is more fun to drive.  For a small SUV it is great to own and drive.  I would buy one again.
car_2005,06 X3,"I had an 04 X3 that was totaled in a side impact accident from which I walked away relatively unscathed. So, when time came to replace it, I didn't hesitate to get another. I love this SUV. It's a joy to drive to work everyday.  The drawbacks are the inability to get the iPod dock or navigation system if you have the satellite radio installation. Another problem are the pirelli tires, I've had to replace three. They seem to have extremely weak sidewalls."
car_2006,X3 sleeper,"I've heard the ad's for the ""ultimate driving machine"". I've had many autos over the years. This X3 handles like a coupe, has all the luxury features I wanted.  THIS CAR IS FUN TO DRIVE. I look forward to entering the cockpit to spin the key. The gas mileage is a little thirstier then I would've liked. Buy it, you'll grin."
car_2007,Excellent,"I have had this SUV for two months now. It has been great so far. It drives like a sports car w/SUV seating.  For some people ride might be little stiff but this suspension setting gives it a better handling capability.  It is well built and well designed.  If you are very particular about what options and configurations you want on this, I suggest placing a special order.  I have mine built the way I wanted and it took from order to delivery about 5 weeks.  Fun part is, you get to follow your cars production cycle on the web."
car_2008,Fine Machine,"Great Driving car, and as a replacement for a ML V8, a great substitute.  Handles as well as my other 3 series coupe, keeps up with traffic and delivers over 22 mpg in combined driving to date."
car_2009,Amazing All-Around,"I had planned for months to get the new 330xi, but when I walked into the dealship and saw a Black Sapphire BMW X3, fully loaded, and with Terracotta seats, I didn't have to think twice about which car to purchase. Overall, the X3 is the best of both worlds. Smaller than the X5 and more versatile than a 3 series. The drive is amazing, it feels almost like a car. Obviously there is more body roll than a 3 series, but far less than an X5. In short, it gets me and all my friends and things to wherever I need to go...fast."
car_2010,"My first BMW ever, love it, love it!!!!!","Everything I expected and a lot more! I think it was a great deal, considering that it is a BMW! Two weeks and 700 miles, defective Sirius radio replaced in 30 minutes, works fine now, no other problems! There is no need to pay for the optional Sirius unit, the factory radio is preset for Sirius and all you need to do is to activate the service! Handling is awesome, ride is great, I don't think it's too stiff. May be I have not tried hard enough but I have not been able to push it to its limit in the corners. Gas mileage is a little low in NYC. Somehow my left leg is never comfortable."
car_2011,One of the best luxury SUVs out there,"X3 is a perfect all-weather luxury SUV with many safety features: front airbags, chest airbags for front passengers, head protection side curtain airbags, ABS, stability control, AWD, daytime running lights, flat tire warning system & telematics assistance.  X3 rides comfortably but not softly & it handles better than all other SUVs I’ve driven, including Cayenne, XC90, ML350, RX & GX.   Noise & vibration are well-controlled. Interior quality is great & it’s significantly better than those in XC90 & ML350. It’s roomy for 4 passengers but 5 is a tight fit.  Reliability is great.  Mileage is not good: 12 mpg overall with mostly city driving & a range of 17 to 20 miles per gallon on highways."
car_2012,Thrilled w/our X3!,"So far I could not be more satisfied and pleased with our 06 BMW X3. Ultra-sumptious interior, striking exterior and amazing smooth ride make this a great vehicle.  Our 2 bulldogs love the roomy rear area, too."
car_2013,My First BMW,"I originally was looking at the Mercedes ML350 but, I wanted a German made automobile.  I'm very glad I chose the BMW X3.  Man, is this car fun to drive.  This car handles the road extremely well.  Is very comfortable inside and also has plenty room.  The quality of the leather interior is amazing.  When sitting inside you know you are in a luxury car.  Hats off to BMW - this is a top notch automobile."
car_2014,Great Bang for the Buck,"My wife needed to replace her Mini Cooper with a bigger, safer car for our new baby.  She loved this car mostly for the looks, but she's been driving it for a few weeks and LOVES it.   It's incredibly easy to drive, has outstanding power, terrific maneuverability, and has handled the rare L.A. rainy season with ease.   There is also plenty  of room in the back, especially with the seats folded down.  The only disappointing thing is the gas mileage.  I expected it to be low, but we're below 14 MPG, including some highway driving.   Ouch."
car_2015,Superb,"It's surely the Ultimate Driving Machine. It has a very quiet ride even at high speeds. All the controls, switches, cup-holders are very thoughtfully placed throughout the interior of the vehicle. I get 21 MPG on highways which is comparable to any other of its class."
car_2016,Love this vehicle ...,This is an incredible vehicle in every way.  I wanted a sports car but needed an SUV - this is the absolute best blend on the planet.  I have the Sports Pkg - the seats fit like a glove and the handling is awesome.
car_2017,Very Nice,"This is my first German car. I have always had Nissan, Toyota, and Honda. Therefore, I love reliability. We got this car on a whim. So far it is outstanding! The drivability is awesome! Handles like a sport sedan and offers plenty of interior space. We love the safety features and secure feeling while driving."
car_2018,I'm very happy,I got my X3 3.0 in March 2005. This vehicle has everything I need. Besides a few small problems the car works fine. This the the 4th BMW I've owned. I live in downtown Chicago and this is an ideal vehicle for city driving. Great turning radius!
car_2019,2006 BMW X3,"Previous car: 1998 M3 (manual trans). It's not in the same league but I had to slow down anyway. The car still gives me a good feel of the road, handles very well, is stylish, and is well appointed. A definitely classy SUV compared with all others on the road. I've had it for 30 days and put 3400 miles on it. Drives great and I can only assume I'll love it for the next 6 years as I did my M3. And I like the 4- year no-maintenance costs. I bought it off the lot with the ZPP Premium package, cold-weather package, xenon headlights, and automatic transmission. Had to buy a bluetooth-capable phone, but it's worth it! Phone calls are very clear through the speaker system. No complaints."
car_2020,The 2006 BMW X3 - wow,"Wow!!!  I love this vehicle.  I have the silver gray metallic with the black and terra cotta interior.  It drives like a sport sedan, but with a higher view like a SUV.  The interior is very well done and easy to clean.  I have the auxillary input for my iPod, and with the upgraded stereo, the sound is fantastic.  I had a 2004 Acura TL, but this summer I hydroplaned and wanted to replace it with something all-wheel drive and more like a SUV without giving up the sportier/more luxurious side of driving.  I could not have asked for anything better.  The only...and I repeat, only downside is the fuel economy."
car_2021,X3 Rebuttal,"Previous car - 1998 4-door BMW M3. Though this car can't compare, it's a fun vehicle to drive. It's roomier than the M3, handles fairly well, has a higher ground clearance. Has Luxury yet not overly done, clean lines. Haven't had it long enough to experience any problems, but I had my M3 for 6 years before problems started popping up. I expect to have this one just as long. 4-years maintenance was too attractive to pass up. Test drove many SUVs (at least 10 cars); the rides were close, but BMW had the maintenance and the tighter steering. I don't mind a stiffer ride if I can feel the road. This isn't a smooth-car ride."
car_2022,BMW X3,"This is my first BMW and I love it, comfortable, fun to drive."
car_2023,2006 BMW X3 (purchased 10/22/2006),"With the 2006 iteration of the X3, the gray cladding is gone from the front end.  A matching painted from end with repositioned fog lights has dramatically improved the aesthetics of the vehicle.   Our X3 has been driven some 800 miles, and over these miles the vehicle has performed flawlessly.  The quality and  finish on this factory ordered X3 is first class.  The handling is superb. The X-Drive works to make driving in water-filled pitted lanes far less demanding of the driver.    The X3 isn't an M3 when it comes to handling, but is IMHO handily superior to the offerings by other SUV marques.  Overall, the X3 is quality and value under $50k."
car_2024,X3,There a too many malfunctions with the X3; 1) doors do not unlock and lock - intermittent. 2) Sunroof does not close completely - intermittent 3) Flat tire light stays on when tires have been checked by the dealer.  4) Jerks in 3rd gear. 5) Not roomy enough. 6) Does not give the BMW feel/lacks quality overall.
car_2025,Very enjoyable to drive but really a 2 seater,"I truly enjoy driving this car.  The handling and acceleration are wonderful.  Exhilarating.   was disappointed that Android Auto is not enabled, but I can connect via Bluetooth.  Tire wear does appear to be a concern as there is a sticker from BMW on the windshield to expect 20k or less.  When tires run more than $1300/set of 4 it is a consideration for cost of maintenance.  There is also no spare, so get run flats or risk getting stuck.  At my height, no one can sit behind me, and as long as your passenger is small, you could travel with 2 passengers.  No one buys this car to share the experience with more than one, and I love my BMW.  I would buy it again.  It is a wonderful car to drive and makes me smile every day."
car_2026,Disappointing,My 640I was the worst car I ever owned. The computer system went out causing the vehicle to malfunction. They replaced it. The windows would not go up in the rain. They tried to fix it but continued to be a problem. The navigation system is the worst. I got tired of all the problems and traded it in at 7000 miles. While driving it to the Chevy dealership to trade it in the computer system went blank and 1 at a time all the systems went black. Absolutely the worst car I have ever owned.
car_2027,Fun to drive but burns oil and idles rough,"I brought a brand new factory ordered 2012 650i 8 speed automatic with heads up display and drivers assist package and LED headlights-sport packaged 20 inch rims with manufacture date 11/2011. Fun to drive with nice design in/out until the low oil level indicator warning came on at 3248 odometer miles. Classic BMW dealership where I bought the car told me it was normal even though the car had short lived 1-2 sec of clanking noice on cold start and rough idle, evident with bottle water in cup holder. Dealership put one quart of oil. 3200 miles later I am low on oil again. Dealership put another quart of oil. Again I am back for 3rd quart of oil at 2794 miles later with 9610 odometer miles!"
car_2028,Wonderful combination of attributes,"The new 650 is surely a GT but it seems like more to me.I can explain best via comparison.It handles and pulls better than my Aston Martin.The cabin is richer than all but 65-level AMG cars.Technical geekiness is on par with a 911.On the other hand, it is not a rare British sculpture but it will have much greater reliability.It is not an S65 but feels better and costs way less.It is surely no 911 in terms of handling, but styling and grace, and lack of pretentious attitude give it the nod.I was ready for a less-involved driving experience, and the 650 is perfect.It is a demanding ride only until I am ready to just relax.I used to need 2 different cars for that."
car_2029,Awesome,"I currently own a 750il and a Range Rover Supercharged.And I have had other vehicles like the Mercedes 320CLK convertible. But I must say, next to the RR, the new 650 convertible is the best car I have ever owned.I wanted the 2011 model, but felt it was just a tad too small for me.But the enlarged the new model signficantly and redesigned many signficant features.It drives like a big car and a sports car.Its sexy and really fun to drive.Very fast and love the rumble of the exhaust.The app option is great as I can listen to Pandora on my iPhoneVery fast.And if you set the ride to comfort, it drives smooth and comfy.More so than the 750i. I highly recommend this car."
car_2030,Thoroughly Impressed!,"I traded in my M3 convertible and purchased the 2012 650i.I went with the M3 in 2008 because the design of the previous model was just not to my taste but the 2012 model definitely turns heads. The 650 isn’t the sports car the M3 was, but it more than makes it up in comfort and design. Don’t get me wrong, the 4.4-liter, 32-valve 400-hp V-8 engine with TwinPower Turbo is plenty enough for any road in the US (excluding race tracks) for most drivers and enthusiasts. It is definitely a great balance of power, performance, gadgetry, and style.Much better than the previous model."
car_2031,2012 BMW 650 M Sport,"I owned a 2009 650 convertible for three year and never had a second's trouble with it.I now have a 2012 650 convertible with M Sport and the Bang and Olfsen sound system.This is the most amazing car that I have ever owned.The power is unreal, it can float across potholes (in Comfort + mode) or feel as connected to the road as the old M6.It is stunning to look at, especially in white, but the best part about the car is the new Bang sound system.It is crystal clear and LOUD enough to shake your clothes.You can describe it.You have to hear it.I'm sorry about the post above that had a problem in the rain.So far, mine is better than my first one."
car_2032,The 2012 BMW 650i is UNSAFE to drive in a thunderstorm.,"The 2012 BMW 650i is UNSAFE to drive in a thunderstorm.I was driving North on Interstate 95 in the left lane at approximately 70 mph when I observed lightning strike about 200 feet ahead of me and to the right of the road.Almost all electrical functionality ceased operation immediately, including the engine and the power steering.Dozens of cars closer to the lightning than me were unaffected.The car has been in the BMW repair shop since July 22, 2011 (53 days and counting).Lightning did NOT strike the car.I observed and heard only one flash and thunderclap.The cloth convertible top is in pristine condition."
car_2033,"Simply, a blast. Migrated from  535i","2007 Z-4, Florida home. Avoid the bigger engine version since it comes only with the sport suspension which is a bit stiff. Test drive on less than perfect roads. Handling suspension terrific given mine was not the sport suspension. Paddle shifters. Decent mileage. Requires 91 octane for max performance. I gas up every 1/2 tank full, rotating between 93 premium and 87 regular. Get 24-25 mpg mixed city, country. Exterior finish exceptional. Abandoned run-flat tires. New set upon CPO purchase trash after 17,500. Switched the Michelin Pilot Sport A-S 3, std. replacement size 225/45/17. Less road noise, better handling. Also, so far 15,000 miles later, no road wobbling characteristic of many run-flats. Wobble symptom: (1) car jumping upon hitting routine concrete highway center seams and (2) on well worn country roads, tires tend to cause car to wobble sideways as tires run in routine tire track road surface depressions. Finally (at last, right?), car maintenance cost after warranty rather expensive, parts and labor. Bottom line, too bad BMW abandoned the Z line effective with 2018 model year."
car_2034,Classic Coupe,"Great looking, really fun to drive."
car_2035,Most enjoyable car I've owned,"This is the most enjoyable car I have ever owned. I got my 07 Z4 Si on a 2 year lease. After 18 months I had a lot of miles left because I also owned my last Corvette and can only drive so much. My wife and I took a 2100 mile road trip to Disney World to use up some miles. When we got back, I sold the Vette and bought this car off lease. I now have just over 4 years in the car and now that the original warranty has expired I have made an extensive search for a replacement. I CAN'T find anything I like better so I'm keeping it. It gets over 30 mpg on the highway and the sports car ride is tight but never abusive. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a genuine sports car."
car_2036,Love my car,"I'm having the time of my life driving this car.  I'm a short (5'3"") female and this is the first car that I feel I really fit in.  It looks fabulous, drives great and has provided the best driving experience I've ever had. I've taken it on 2 road trips (one 500 miles, and the other 700 miles) and was amazed at how my back didn't hurt after. My only heart burn is the large lease payment that I make every month.... other than that it's great!"
car_2037,"Good Looks, Terrible Ride","Worst Car I've Ever Owned.  Although the car is a head turner, I am anxiously counting the days until my lease is over and I can turn this horrible car back to the dealership.  German suspensions are wonderful for flawless German roads, but unfortunately, the suspension is way, way too stiff for flawed American roads.  The ride is HORRIBLE.  I feel every bump in the road.  The seats are poorly padded and after a half hour in the car I am ready to get out of it ASAP.  Sadly, I took it from Washington DC to New York and by the time I got to my destination I wanted to leave it on the side of the road.  That was the last road trip for it, now only use it because it is small and easy to park."
car_2038,Roadster,"Great car, love the styling; straight-six sounds great and the manual gearbox is super-smooth. Love the seating position, as well as the interior space with the easy-folding top up. Very nice to drive, the car is very communicative and gives you lots of confidence, brakes are amazing and stop the car with little drama. My only complaint is with the interior build-quality. The one-piece door panels are great, but the steering column is tilted, a cup holder is broken (I don't even use them) and the transmission tunnel plastic trim squeaks when you rest your arm on it. Besides that, everything you touch is of high-quality and just driving it takes your mind off its few squabbles."
car_2039,What a car!,"I've had my Z4 coupe 15 months and have 17,700 miles on it.  First car I have ""loved""!  I'm 65 and behind the wheel, I feel like 25.  I have driven just about all sport cars, but none have turned me on, like my coupe.  I drove a Porsche on a race track once, but this coupe will beat that Porsche on any curve anytime.  And I might add, for half the price.   The Z4 coupe is and will be the only car for me.  When I'm too old to drive, I'll sit in my rocker, rock the day away, while looking at my Z."
car_2040,What I expected,"I bought this car as a retirement present present to myself (curiously, I see a lot of guys (mostly) my age driving these cars!). I have thoroughly enjoyed driving for short hops. I have taken 3 trips of 500 miles and this is not the car for it. The RFTs amplify the bumps on bad roads, and we all know what I-95 can be like. Other than that, it is so much fun to drive and cornering is a terrific experience. I have the 6-speed manual and wouldn't consider the automatic - that would just be wrong in a sports car."
car_2041,Design getting better with age,"When the Z4 came out to replace the Z3, I thought they ruined the idea.  It's a much different car and when you drive it, you can forget about the Z3.  The lines on the car all seem to fit and have purpose, even though I'm not a fan of the Bangle designs.  I bought the Z4 3.0si convertible which is a fast car and looks unbelievable with the sport package and 18"" wheels.  The sport package completely changes the look and driving of the car, it's a must.  It's fast enough even with the auto trans which has the paddle shifters.  The extended leather and premium M seats are a must too.  All the options raise the price, but if you're seriously considering this car, cost is not a concern."
car_2042,"Instant, incredible fun","Nothing like completely changing a day as to hop into the Z and spring off into the night. Incredible driving experience and am lucky to have many windy roads to enjoy. Fun, fun, fun!"
car_2043,2007 BMW Z4 3.0si 6 spd manual,"I purchased my Z4 for pleasure driving only (sunshine time).  This was to replace my previous convertible of 5 years that I sold last year.  After test driving numerous cars, once I sat in the Z4 I knew this was one for me.  It amazes me every time I take it out for a drive!  Usually there is a limit that a car can handle in driving performance but I still can't find it with this Z4.  It's like ""I can take that, I dare you to go farther!""  Needless to say, this is a car that can get you in trouble.   BMW really knows how to design and build an exceptional convertible.  They have mastered what it takes to create an unparalleled driving experience.   I am impressed."
car_2044,Want to have fun? Drive this!,"Purchased mine certified used with 11000 miles on it.  Very fun to drive!  Looks fast, is fast.  I rarely used to put the windows down in my old cars, but with this car I put the windows and top down every chance I get!  I get many compliments on it--it is simply a sharp looking car and turns plenty of heads. I love how Z4s are not as widely popular as, say, a 3-series and that was a big reason why I purchased mine.  If you're looking to buy, seriously consider the metallic silver color with premium package.  With the sharp angles of the body styling, silver looks beautiful!"
car_2045,2007 BMW Z4 3.0si,"Wow, I compared this vehicle head-to- head with Porsche Boxter & new Audi TT.  The classic design along with BMW safety and technology won me over hands down."
car_2046,Fantastic car,"This is by far the best vehicle I've ever driven. Simply a blast to drive, even with the ESP on. You'd be hard pressed to find a car that handles better. It inspires confidence going into every corner, and with skin off your face brakes and an unbelievably seamless ESP, even when the most OMG situations come up, you have the brakes and the control to avoid idiot drivers. The suspension is a little bit on the egg-beater side, but it's well within the range of comfortable, without sacrificing real performance. Basically, this car does everything you tell it to, making everything feel really easy."
car_2047,A True Sports Car,"I love the car.  Bought it w/sport & premium package - no nav. I feel like I am driving a rocketship stereo with its the THX sound and direct aux for my listening to my iPod.  It still has a few minor quirks (like remote door locks - sometimes the passenger side won't unlock w/the remote and have to unlock from the center button), which a car this price should not have.  This is the first BMW I have purchased and now understand the obsession. There is no better feeling than putting it into ""SD"" (automatic trans) and seeing all the other cars left in the dust :)"
car_2048,What A Ride!!!,"When the worst thing you can say is that the cupholders need to be redesigned, you're on to something.  This car is a head-turning, sleek machine with incredible control and power.  Great fun to drive."
car_2049,Beware of Z4 deficiencies!,"This review focuses more on the bad... fragile paint (scratches too easily), mostly plastic (can't wax out those scratches), annoying beeper (won't shut up for 1 minute, no chimes!), seat belt can't be adjusted (irritates neck), runflat tires sensitive (added air twice in 4 months), 6 speed manual doesn't shift smoothly, doesn't hold value (depreciated $13K < 4 months, so I'm stuck!), steering keeps driver way too active, ride quality on rough roads is unacceptable (feel every imperfection!), noisy with roof up, rattles.  BMW engineers have ruined this car! Our 2003 Z4 was superior!  Yep, I have high standards, especially when I pay $47K+ for a new BMW!"
car_2050,Awesome,"I was initially hesitant about buying a roadster, but after owning this for two months I wished I had purchase this sooner. Make sure you get the stick shift because that's half the fun. Also get the sports pkg with the sports mode and upgraded wheels. The sports mode provides livelier accel and steering. When driving the Z, the car is truly one with the driver (me)."
car_2051,2007 BMW Z4,"I wanted a little excitement in my  life and this car really does the trick.  It's so much fun to drive, I hate to get out of it. I leased the 3.0 convertible w/automatic trans and premium pkg. Punch this baby and you're on a roll. This car turns heads everywhere I go. It looks fast, it is  fast, and it sticks to the road like glue."
car_2052,3rd BMW Z car,"Started with a 2.3 Z3, moved to 3.0 Z3 and now 3.0si Z4. This is the best one so far. Took me a few years to warm to the styling but now suddenly it clicked. The chassis is exceptionally stiff - as stiff as the Z3 coupe was. Makes a huge difference. The car feels of one piece and there are no rattles or creaks. Huge storage space in the trunk (for a 2 seater), excellent gas mileage, very powerful engine. A pleasure to drive."
car_2053,Not a Suitable 5-series Replacement,"A good 2nd car for fun in the sun, with great looks and handling, but not a suitable replacement for my 2000 540i. The wind noise on the highway and comfort on bumpy roads is not very good, so consider this for daily travel.  More of a weekend ""lets have fun"" car.  Personally I think our 2003 Z4's 5-speed shifted smoother and quicker and its ride was not so harsh (as I recall), so I'm a bit disappointed by this 2007 Z4. The 6-speed shifting bothers me the most, since I do a lot of it! (Oh well.)"
car_2054,Great 2nd Car,"The car does what you'd expect... great acceleration, exhaust note, handling.  When driven with the top up on those not-so-perfect days, there are a few rattles in the roof/seats.  It's not as fast as a Vette off the line, but the seats are exceptionally comfortable, the THX stereo sounds awesome, and the nimble handling make it all worth while in the end.  However, if you plan to do most of your driving with the top up or in the winter months don't bother!"
car_2055,Pure sports car,"I leased a 2007 BMW Z4 3.0si to use as a daily driver, as my wife drives our 2006 Land Cruiser. It did not take long to realize that this car is for weekends only!  It is cramped and the ride over older roads will knock fillings out of your mouth!  That said, it is a great sports car.  The handling, transmission, and power are great.  It is an absolutlely fun car in the cool of the morning or for a romantic drive in the evening, but it is not intended to replace a sedan.  I am taking the penalty to get the 2008 535i!"
car_2056,Fun Car Obession to Drive,What a fun car to drive. Get heated seats no matter where you live. Great feeling when top is down. Get the M seats. The Nav is great today ties in to radio and phone and great maps. Double click remote and you can put top down before entering car. Get the prem package and sport package. Get Xenon lights and hard top prep. Sport button is awesome great driving stability control sytem. Entended leather is awsome. Wanted automatic transmission thus the 3.0si. 265 HP plenty but if you just want manual and 355 HP go for M. It's a fun fun fun car.  0 to 60 in 6 secs. Fast rides great feels great. Heads turn when they see.
car_2057,Worth looking into,"This car is a definite good buy. I have leased this 2006 BMW Z4 3.0i and so far I have been satisfied. The overall perfomance is great but one thing I would rather have is front wheel drive instead of rear because it affects driving in rain. Since I live in Las Vegas the rain is not an often issue, but when it actually rains I have to watch out and drive carefully on turns. Gas mileage is rather typical for 3.0. Interior design is not what I have expected and this is my biggest disappointment. It really looks cheap maybe because I am used to Audi's unusual design but still this is not so good for a BMW."
car_2058,Love the Z4,"Just purchased my 2015 Z4 s35i Alpine White with Red leather interior.  The car was Certified with only 2,348 miles.  I owned a 2004 Z4 in 2008 and really liked the ride.  I sold the Z4 and purchased a 2006 Corvette convertible.  It was a nice car with a lot of power but was lacking in the ride.  I was looking for either a Z4 or Mercedes SLK.  The Z4 was just what I was looking for, exec driven and was totally loaded with all the bells and whistles.  It is extremely quiet and rides like a dream.  However, there are two cons: trunk space is limited with top down, and gas mileage is around 24 mpg, less than my 400 hp vette. But all-in-all, it is still the ultimate driving machine."
car_2059,07 BMW Z4 si,I don't know if there is another car as fun to drive as this.
car_2060,Stylish roadster,"Sporty and comfortable roadster with great build quality and materials. Seats are amazing and power is very good on the 4 cylinder model.  The hardtop takes kind of a long time to put up and down and draws a lot of attention so not as quick as a softtop but it's much more secure and gives the car a nice dual personality with the top up vs down. Rearward visibility is among the best i've seen with minimal blind spots and great mirrors that auto dim at night.The 6 speed manual is slick and easy to easy to use and makes it feel like a proper sports car. Rev matching is easy and the engine is torquey and willing at almost any RPMThe standard run-flat tires are too hard and non-forgiving and make for a terrible ride especially with the M package suspension and larger wheels.  I recommend swapping them out for non run-flats and sticking to 17 or 18 inch wheels.The car looks and is small from the outside but feels larger and very substantial from the inside. It's probably at least 300lbs overweight though. Even though it has great power and decent fuel economy, this car would really benefit from losing a few pounds. As is it's more of a comfortable, fast highway cruiser then a tight-curve hugging car that you can fling around.  This would be a seriously great car if it lost a few pounds but it's still an enjoyable and classy vehicle."
car_2061,a ton of fun,"I love the retractible hard top.  Most beautiful car I have ever owned, imo.  Not much storage space for luggage, but I didn't buy a Z4 for the size of the trunk.  All BMWs that I have owned have had high maintenance costs, but they will run forever if properly maintained."
car_2062,LOVE my new to me Z4,"I had driven 3 straight MB Cabs and no longer needed a back seat; I wanted a roadster since a teen. I think it was the Alfa Duetto Spider 1600 from one of my favorite movies, The Graduate. The latest Alfa, Jag and FIAT were eliminated as perceived as unreliable. The R8 way too pricey , the SL  drove too ""boulevard like"" ie not sports car like. The SLK and Miata were, forgive the term, chick cars; the Nissan 370 and Corvette, again, forgive, red neckish.  That left the Boxter S and the Z4 35IS. I drove all of the above and though the Boxter S was great, the Z4 35IS REALLY stood out; I would describe driving it as a ""Tight Glove-like fitting, Rocket"". It doesn't hurt that I love the lines and don't see one everyday, as I do Boxters. BMW reliability as well as the 5 Year 100K  extended warranty that came with the car didn't hurt either."
car_2063,Too many repairs,"Front struts, valve cover gasket, tranmisssion seal, front end grouments all needed replacement at 25,000 miles. Has issues with vibration in convertable top also. Both rear rims cracked due to poor manufacturer process. Too costly to drive."
car_2064,"Not a Cayman or a Boxster, but good for what it is","One thing one needs to accept about this car is that it's not meant to compete on the track against a Cayman S or Boxster S.  It's just not that kind of car.  It's absolutely great for what it was built for, which is to be an enjoyable high speed, top down cruiser.  If you drive these other cars, you will immediately notice how much better they handle, but for everyday driving, the Z4 is quite good.  The N54 engine is superb and eminently chip-able.  The car is comfortable and luxurious.  The only cons I've really identified is that in the 2011 model year, some cars do not come with the Combox controller, which means you won't have bluetooth audio capabilities.  Also, the handling in some tight corners feels a bit delayed.  I've felt the rear end skitter out on me more than a few times.  Not the extent that it would be dangerous or cause any real concern, but it certainly doesn't have the ""turn on a dime"" feel of those mid-engined cars."
car_2065,"2011 Z4 sDrive35is, A Smile Making Machine!","Purchased a CPO Z4 sDrive35si with all the options and limited edition interior... 25k miles.  This car is a smile making machine!  First, I drive in the real world, not a test track.  If you can make this care misbehave in a turn, you're going too fast for real roads!  It is super tight and sticks to corners like glue!  Heart pounding and big smile!  The most amazing thing is the power band never quits!  Ever hit a golf ball just right and watched it rocket away only to see it get a second blast of power!  That's the Z4... You punch it down and it blasts off, hits 110mph in a flash and then blasts off again!  It wants and has so much more!  All this in a comfort that no Boxster can provide."
car_2066,My Dream Car,"I've always wanted a BMW Z roadster ever since I test drove a Z3 in San Diego.At the time, I had just started working full time.I have always been an Engineer, but at the time I had a mountain of debt.When I finally had the means to purchase my dream car, Chris Bangle (Germany's answer to Sir Mix-a-Lot) violated the Z3's successor, the first generation Z4.So, I had to wait 7 long years for that abomination to leave the stage.The E89 Z4 was worth the wait.Strangers and acquaintences alike come up to me all the time to tell me that I have a beautiful car. I don't need a car that costs any more money, has any more performance, or looks any better (if possible)."
car_2067,"In shop 5 weeks out of 7 months, and still counting...","Purchased in April 2011:Running board fell off! 2 days in shop (of all things, they cant get this right?!)Engine stalls at low rpms. 4 days in shopRoof leaks. 21 days in shopCreak in rear suspension. 6 days in shop and still counting..."
car_2068,The Perfect Roadster,"I recently got the 2011 z435i with the 7 speed automatic, premium package, sport package, premium sound.It combines luxury, style, and performance better than any other car out on the road. It has a distinguished look and gets a lot of attention on the road.You can drive it like a true sports car with its high performance options, large horse power, and great handling.Or you can take it for a luxurious lazy sunday drive for hours with the top down, nice sound system and comfortable spacious seating for a 2 seat car.It wont beat the Porshe Boxter on a track but I feel the interior comfort, comparable unique style, and price difference make up for it. It is a very sexy fun car to drive"
car_2069,Drive them all and you'll choose this one!,"Purchased this vehicle coming from M6 through E63 AMG. Although M6 is very fast, SMG tranny is HORRIBLE in real life. AMG is an absolute MB service dream (8 weeks in service out of 6 months of ownership). So after browsing 911, SLK and boxter - I decided to go with the Z4. Hardtop convertible is awesome. Features, although very pricey (base $52k, mine $66K) are all there. Handling, although criticized, is very adequate. This car is not built to be driven on track only, it is a very comfortable sports car adaptation to real life conditions. Highway cruising feels like a 7. Thumbs up, BMW, can't wipe the smile off my face every time I drive it! Bi turbo is a mast, base model lacks power, etc."
car_2070,Thrills,This is the second Z4 that my wife and I have owned.Had the first one 7 years and not one problem.This Z4IS is more comfortable. It has much more power. I drive pretty sporty and it gets 29 MPG.Get lots of thumbs up.
car_2071,Near-perfect roadster,"After several 3-series coupes this is my first ever roadster.  Although inherently impractical, it is much fun to drive - I love the throaty growl and sharp steering turn-in."
car_2072,The perfect roadster,"I took BMW Performance Center delivery of my 2011 Z4 sDrive 35i. That means that for four on-track hours BMW race drivers taught me how to explore safely the limits if a Z4 identical to the one I was purchasing. That experience and teaching has made my ownership much more pleasurable and rewarding than it ever could have been otherwise. I cannot recommend it too highly. The Z4 is a classic roadster and as such is completely at home on the country roads and Blue Ridge Parkway of my home state. The exhaust note is wonderful, nostalgic, echoing Healeys of old. The engine power is more than adequate and the driving experience, top up or top down, is immensely pleasurable. BMW got this car right!"
car_2073,2011 Z4 35i rocks!,"I have had this car for three days and I love everything about it. Styling is beautiful, the cockpit is so roomy that you do not feel like you are in a two-seater at all, visibility is very good also. The retractable hard top is a big plus, I was always turned off by rag tops or having to stow a removable hardtop, this is the perfect solution. I did not want to give up the luxuries and conveniences of my larger car and I didn't, this car is loaded with all of the ""bells and whistles"". Performance is amazing, this is my first BMW and it is an ""ultimate driving machine"". Last night I tried the sport transmission for the first time and it floored me!"
car_2074,Sharp Car!,"My 2003 BMW Z4 looks great, and drives great, I get compliments every where I go. Most people think that it's newer than an '03. I think it's the smartest style in it's class!"
car_2075,So much fun!,"Does not handle bumps or dips well at all, nor dirt or puddles, but what do you expect from a sports car? It is so much fun to drive--the top comes down automatically, the steering is excellent, the acceleration is amazing, the look is great, the sound system is phenomenal"
car_2076,Love this little car.,"Ok. I know it's not new, but it's totally fun. I love my little car. My friend calls it my go-cart, but that's because he's jealous. It has great pick up when I need to move or go up a hill, I know it will go swiftly. I feel safe in the car. Because it's older, it doesn't have a lot of the new technology that newer cars have. No blue tooth or navigation, but I don't need that where I drive. I enjoy getting in my car every day. I get loads of compliments on how the car's style has stayed ""in style"" and everyone thinks its a new car and is 14 years old! I couldn't be happier with my lil Z4."
car_2077,Great roadster,It was between this or leasing a new Miata. The BMW definitely feels like a more solid car. Very pleased with my purchase.
car_2078,Bad ass 3.0,"I bought this car in May of 2015 with 55,000 miles for only $12,500 ( I now have 62,000 on the odometer).  I cannot wait to drive each and every day and wow does the 3.0 automatic ever haul ass. The torque curve is steady throughout the entire ride from 0-100++. No lag, just ferocious power. My only complaint is the amber light cluster for exterior temp and mpg is partially burned out. Also, it's very hard to see objects in the rear view mirror due to some peculiar bmw dimming system.  Other than that, drop the top and boogie!"
car_2079,Great Car,Great Car
car_2080,Fun car to drive. Still gets lots of attention,Look for a well cared for car.  These cars beg for you to push them. One that is taken care of will give you years of enjoyment.  The car has the look that many will envy.  its fun to drive and if you get a premium equipt model you will not be disappointed.  Enough said.
car_2081,2003 Z4 3.0 manual,"I have driven this car on the highway at 80 mph for 50 miles to work each way for the last 4 years.   I bought it with 107k miles and it now has 276 k miles and runs like new and looks almost new.   I drive the car through hailstorms, snowstorms, and windstorms of the West Texas Panhandle, and it performs amazingly well.   It gets about 27 mpg on the highway.    This car has held up well."
car_2082,Get out while  you can,"Thosewho owned the car and sold it are fortunate. Bought mine in 08 with 99K miles but dealer maintained. It was a fair weather driver and what a mistake. The car now has 104K miles and I've spent some $15K in repairs. Things like water pump, oil pump, alternator, motor mounts, numerous sensors and of course the top. I've replaced the hydraulic pump twice and the side pistons once. I've spent some $5000 just on the hydraulics. It seems the car is notorious for having leaks in the vaccum hose system. The cup holders never worked, and I just let that pass.It's almost as though I can expect a $500 repair each time I drive it. Not what I bargained for."
car_2083,10 years of driving pleasure,"I recently sold my 2003 Z4, purchased new in August, 2003.It had 52,000 nearly trouble free miles.It was never driven hard and always garaged.I was 52 with good knees when I bought it.Ten years later my wife and I have both had knee operations and getting in and out was a chore.Plus, at 6'3"", getting in and out with the top up was a chore.With a wife who doesn't know how to pack lightly, anything more than an overnight trip wasn't practical due to the small trunk.Plus no back seat meant no rides for the dog or grandkids.So, it's gone and a new 128i convertible is on a big boat between Germany and the US with delivery expected soon.I hope I have as much fun with this one."
car_2084,Good Car For The Price,"Bought from dealer with 5000 miles on it.Also, had a Z3.The style of the Z4 is not as nice as the Z3 but many features of the Z4 are an improvement.Great engine.Smooth with plenty of power.I am 6'2"" and , unlike many two seaters, has good room for the driver.Expensive to maintain, but I only drive it on sunny days with the top down.Just hit 20,000 miles.Red color and gets lots of compliments.I am satisfied."
car_2085,Disappointed in Quality,"I only have 30000 miles on my BMW Z4 2003; I bought it out at the end of my lease; the elec. motor for the convertible top short circuit due to run off water that enters the plastic housing where the elec. motor sits in. The water can't drain and the electric motor will rust and quit. Very expensive repair, poor design. I had the housing replaced in 2008 and now it needs to be replaced again and of course my extended warranty won't cover the repair nor will the dealership... very poor design indeed and not at all what I expected from BMW.I also just had to replace the rubber around the windshield and the cowel due to dry rot.I would have thought the convertible roof of a BMW would last"
car_2086,Can do,Great running car. Driver seat wears where seat belt rubs exposing under layer. Car is good handling and gives full feel of road changes. Actually drove around deer standing on freeway while going 55 and it felt like 25 mph. Quick response steering and extremely stable. No dealerships for 400 miles found good private shop. Still a thrill to drive every time after year and a half. Switched from motorcycle to z4 no regrets!
car_2087,Fun Car,"Just completed 8000 miles between MI @ CA including Glacier Nat. Park. HWY 2, 20, 299,101 and 1. Gas mileage on reg gas 28 to 35 mpg. Have owned Datsun Z cars in past. This is the best."
car_2088,Needs improvement,"Owned the car since 2004 has now 82,000 miles, performed well under warranty, had to replace the motor for the convertible top at 42,000 mi and now again at 82,000. both times the elec. motor short circuit due to run off  water  that enters  the plastic housing where the elec. motor sits in. The water can't drain and the electr. motor will rust and quit. Very expensive repair, poor design.  Car handles great, fun to drive on smooth roads but noisy, and potholes are deadly and my wife hates to put on her make-up while we are driving, rough ride"
car_2089,Would be great if I could steer it!,"Very nice and fun to drive, however when the temperature gets over 80 degrees the power electronic steering stops working.  This is a known problem to BMW (bulletin # 4515500-02) and a safety issue but they want $3000 to fix it. - So much for German Engineering, maybe it never gets above 80 degrees in Baveria!"
car_2090,The Good and the Bad,"Shortly after purchasing it used at 59,200 miles, the coolant light came on so I filled it up when the engine was cold and it continues to leak whenever the coolant expands with a hot engine. I'm guessing the coolant expansion tank is cracked.  Other than the above mechanical issue this car draws a lot of semi-truck drivers attention and praises and other people on the road also.  It feels like this car has sticky glue on the tires during fast turns.  Manual 6-speed transmission shifts wonderfully.  Not the fastest car on the road against say a Ford 500GT or any other hot rods but this Z4 has the right balance between styling and performance."
car_2091,Disappointed,"If you buy these cars, expect to shell out big bucks for repairs. We have an extended warranty which so far has been of no use because of water leakage. The top wouldn't open because of a leak. BMW at least paid for labor, parts still cost us 800.00. Now the wipers stopped working. Some part cracked and water again somehow got in. Going to cost 1100.00 to fix and again, it's not covered under the warranty. Great looking and handling car, but poorly built. Will never buy a BMW again."
car_2092,Plus and Minus,"Bought our jet black '03 with 23,750 mi. on it (our 5th sports car, out 1st BMW). 2.5L eng, Premium and conven. packages, auto trans, 18"" ellipsis wheels w/RFTs. Handles well. Electric steering so it gives no feedback thru steering wheel. Accelerates well, esp between 45 and 80. Seat bottoms aren't very comfortable after 45 min. Less interior storage space than a Miata. Roomy trunk for a sports car (no spare tire w/RFT pkg). Electronic displays are hard to read in daylight. Dynamic Stability Control necessitates alignments being performed by dealer - $90. Dealer oil changes are $90. Beautiful car that draws lots of attention from other drivers and pedestrians.  Shrinking violets need not apply!"
car_2093,I still love it,"My car has 125000 and I still LOVE the Z4 after 5 years. It is comfortable, has good gas mileage (31 mpg on highway) even though I am low to the ground, I feel safe on the rainy, winding roads. The only problem I have ever had is not mechanical, the front skirt is so low to the ground that I had to change it twice because it broke. It is so reliable and fun to drive that I will drive it until the end!"
car_2094,2003 BMW Z4 Premium/Sport Everything Rvw,"I was shopping for a sports car and shortly after driving this car I fell in love with it. The handling is amazing and it's got some ""get up and go"". I will warn you, IT IS A HIGH MAINTENANCE VEHICLE. I bought it 4 months ago with 62k and have had to do 10x as much work as I ever did on my Toyota Tacoma in 2 years. Convertible top doesn't work, Tire sensors were malfunctioning, Turn signal went out, Windshield Wipers malfunctioned, can't jack it up because it is so low, inconvenient access to almost everything, chews up tires because negative camber is set at 3% stock (change to 2% at next alignment )...and still, I am planning to buy a 2009 Z4 because they are THAT FUN! Warning: Chick Magnet."
car_2095,Smile on my face,"I have had this car for 6 years and I still can't get over how much fun it is to drive.  I rented a Corvette on vacation and couldn't believe the difference.  The Z is fast, refined and nimble, the Corvette was fast, loud and didn't handle as well as my 1961 Corvair.  The only car I have seen that would make me want to trade it is the 2010 Z with the twin Turbo.  That has to be scary fast."
car_2096,First model year blues,"I bought the car in January to just drive in good weather. While the car is fun to drive, it only gets 20mpg on premium. In 4 months I replaced the valve cover, oil pan and oil filter gaskets. My mechanic said this is nothing out of the ordinary. The driver's air bag light will not turn off, 5 other sensors do not function, the side mirror control does not work, the drink holders do not come out, the radio and single disk CD player have problems, etc. I wrote to BMW given these are non-mileage issues and no response. I was used to Nissan ""Z"" cars that go and go with no problems. What a disappointment."
car_2097,Still Like it After 6 Years,"This is my second review. First one was in 2005 when it was 2 years old. Now has 38,000 miles. Reliability has been good - no problems.  Maintenance costs high, but it's a BMW. Great road car. Handles superbly and engine and manual transmission match perfectly."
car_2098,Excellent all the way around,"I've driven mine across the country and it's superb in all respects -- fun, reliable, great gas mileage, great performance, all ways.  Even though it's small, it has good storage space and excellent driving compartment space.  Gas mileage on the road is 34-38 mpg.  Semi-auto transmission is fun, but jerks on changes often, annoying.  All in all, a plus, though.  I'd buy another without question."
car_2099,Z4ME,"I bought my jet black 2003 Z4 in 7/08.  I have put on 6,000 miles in Minnesota and have enjoyed everyone.  Speed control and power window placement questionable, cup holder is limited.  Like the sport button-whole new car when on.  Good daily driver, however, you must miss or slow down for every pot hole and RR Xing.  Power top fast enough to put up and down in rush hour.  If you buy this car must put a 3M clear bra on ($400). The hood is a rock magnet. Always a head turner.  I will come out of a store and always see people looking in.  This is my 4th BMW (1 325 xi, 1 325i, and 1 x5)  by far the most impractical but ALWAYS the most fun. 35 male-Minnesota"
car_2100,Dependable?,"Bought the car in November of 2003. Loved the drive of the car and was impressed with the it's lines.  Within the first 3,000 miles, had to repair both front tires due to puncture.  After 10,000 miles had to replace all 4 tires.  Inflation pressure listed by BMW was not the same as required by the tire company.  No problem with tires after proper inflation. Soft top would not function due to a leak in system.  Fixed under warranty. Problem with front suspension system.  Fixed under warranty. Few months after warranty ended, master computer system failed. Replacement value $1,300.  BMW paid half.  Currently car is in shop for front suspension system problems again."
car_2101,I LOVE MY Z4,This car hugs the road so nicely it just give me goose bumps when I drive it. My mother thinks the car is the coolest and loves driving in it with the top down.
car_2102,I love this car,"Fabulous car.  Replaced a (blown) 97 Miata STO which was a spectacular car--but the Z has everything my beloved Miata did not (legroom, to name only one example!).  I've had it for a couple of months now and just flat love this car.  Performance is wonderful, build quality is stellar and chicks dig it.  Only suggestion for improvement would be to increase interior storage space a bit. Very happy to have this car and would recommend it without hesitation."
car_2103,"Great, even 5 years after manufacture!","I fell in love with the Z4 while looking for a sports car. Had a rough start though; since I have the sport package a deep pothole ate the passenger side and forced a repair. Then the convertible top refused to work. Then an electrical failure forced another round of work. In all though, I've taken this to the track and on road trips-and it's been sheer joy. Even driving to work is fun!  It's gotten nice looks from passerby too. A few nits: tire roar is deafening even with top up, rattles galore on rough roads, and auto top suffers from finicky electrical shortages.  But don't let those stop you from buying this wonderful machine."
car_2104,BMW Z4 3.0 2003,"This is the best car I have ever owned. After 40,000 miles the only repair  required (at no cost) was to reset the passenger window. Great fun to drive and extremely reliable. I am thinking about buying a new car, but I hate to give this one up!"
car_2105,Running Young,"Soon to be 52 and adding a 16 year old daughter to the highway led to this purchase. Wow! Amazing how quick memories return to the 70s and 80s open tops of 280z, TR6, Spitfire and my first, 1969 Fiat. Wonderfully balanced handler, just enough interior space, stunning exterior lines. Hard to read electronic displays when top is down, cup holders a waste, and no locking compartments. Small issues given every minute of fun you'll feel behind the wheel!"
car_2106,Mid Life Crisis,"I traded in my 740iL for something a little smaller and more fun to drive and was not disappointed. I have been driving BMW since the early 90s and have had nothing but positive experiences with them all. I started in Europe where the BMW is at home on the autobahn then moved here to the States. The Z4 is quick and nimble, and though I chose the smaller 2.5 it has more than enough power to get things moving. Mileage is great for the power it has. The engine is typical BMW, VERY smooth and quiet. Trunk space is large for the class but interior storage is lacking. I have the sport suspension which is, at times, stiff enough to jar you when large bumps are found. Handling is great."
car_2107,Maldive Blue,"Bought the car in August 2006, great car.  First BMW, as I was told many times, every little detail is thought through.  Automatic windshield wipers, automatic lights, on board computer etc.  Was a little disappointed with performance, could be faster in straight lines, but very impressive in curvy roads.  Love the stability control, really helps the rear from staying where it should.  A great fun car with no backseat. I love it."
car_2108,Fun Car to Drive,"Everyone looks car handles well, fun to drive short or long distances - my partner and I still call driver, mine has every option but 10 speaker DVD nav system, I am glad I chose this car over others."
car_2109,First time BMW owner,"It is an excellent performance vehicle, I have had a lot of fun driving and look forward to having this vehicle for a long time.  The only option I did not receive and wish I had purchased was the the navigational system.  Lastly, beware this vehicle is an attention getter."
car_2110,z4 35i sdrive,"Great roadster with just about the perfect balance between performance and comfort. People often complain the weight of the hard top and it's not as engaging as the Porsche Boxster/Cayman; but hey, the Boxster is a few grand more expensive even with the base form and the s can easily be $20k+ more pricey. If you don't track, the z4 with the N54 engine will be more than enough performance for your daily use. Also, the hard top gives you a sense of security versus any of the soft cloth top, plus looks way better when top is up. Since the new z4 will come only with a soft top, I will just keep mine until the wheels fall off. There's really not many choices if you want a modern hard top roadster (all come to my mind are z4, slk/slc, sl, Ferrari California, mx-5). I think the z4 has a sweet spot in the segment in terms of comfort, performance, style, price and will hold its value pretty good in the future."
car_2111,"Cool, outstanding acceleration, great exhaust","Very cool roadster that turns heads with acceleration feel that seems to defy actual zero to sixty specs.  Highway handling is competent but tight fast cornering is not great .... better than most cars and actually ho,do welll but long nose doesn't inspire the confidence to push through the turn.  Low profile run flats are fine on most roads but are harsh on coarse pavement.  For everyday summer driving, it is a fun, fast car that I just love to drive.  Other vehicle is an Audi S5 that is more refined, almost as fast but not neatly as fun."
car_2112,Love my Z4is!,"Be prepared for people to have opinions about this car! Some neighborhood wives will disapprove silently, some neighbors will love it. But I have also been stopped to ask ""How do you like it? I've thought about getting one too!"" It will turn heads. But, regardless, I love the feeling I get driving this car!"
car_2113,Simply fun at every turn!,"After every drive I tell my wife, ""I really enjoy that car"". It is a roadster, not a luxury sedan. It's firm, but compliant for a roadster, even in sports and sports+ modes it's not terribly rough... for a true roadster. Having said that, it's very *easy* to drive, but when you get on it, damn, it becomes an entirely different beast.   I love the hard top - both the functionality and styling are incredible. With the top down, let even more good times roll! I highly recommend the sdrive 35i as the torque, overall performance, and the wheel-tire combo is much more suitable for this type of car."
car_2114,Roadster Love,This is a pure driving machine. I have loved roadsters my entire life. I love to drive and feel the road beneath me. This car is amazing and I will have it until they take the keys away!
car_2115,Z4 Zips!!!!,As someone who has owned many BMW's I was curious as to how this stacked up vs. my 428I. I thoroughly enjoyed the car and wish I had purchased it vs. the 428!It rides and handles better and is a much more fun car vs. the 428.
car_2116,Great Car!,"The Z4 is the most enjoyable car I have ever owned.  It has exceeded my expectations and I am constantly looking for an excuse to go anyware so I can get behind the wheel and drive.  In one word, it is simply FUN!"
car_2117,Awesome Z4,The most fun auto to drive in my 40 plus years of driving.
car_2118,Pure Entertainment,"Bought car with 28,000 miles on it and it's a dream sports car. Great performance, responsive and quiet, even with the top down. It's nearly as quiet as my lexus with the top up. Very comfortable, very fast, very happy. I'm always looking for a reason to drive somewhere."
car_2119,The Drive of your Life,We love our BMW Z4. It handles well in all weather conditions and by far looks about the best of any convertible in the market.
car_2120,"A ""toy"" for the suburbs","I'm a mid-lifer whose purchase reflects a typical mid-life crisis decision. It's a vehicle that's truly a fun ""toy"". After so many years of driving the terribly practical sedans of the day the Z4 injects a healthy shot of adrenaline as well as a double dose of reality .. (1) It takes a little while to use the 6-speed manual transmission with the unconscious competence needed to enjoy the ride to the max, and (2) Heck, when did I get so old??? Being a practical man with an attitude that frowns upon ""social status via automobile"", I clearly stepped out-of-my-box with this purchase. It does draw a great deal of attention. That alone takes some getting used to."
car_2121,I'm Lovin' it!,This was truly worth the wait.  The power and handling of my Z4 is performance magic.  I’ve wanted a Z4 ever since they first came out.  She is perfect in every way.  She has plenty of truck space; it’s amazing how much you can really fit in there.  I’m averaging 25 MPG.  It’s everything and more you expect from the ultimate driving machine.
car_2122,A very fun & quick roadster,"I had a 2000 Boxster for 3 years before purchasing my Z4.  It is Toledo Blue w/ tan interior.  Sports package, chrome eliptical wheels & SMG.  I would have preferred the 6 speed manual - but my wife wanted an automatic.  SMG seemed like a good compromise.  It took a while to get used to - but now we both enjoy it.  The main complaint is that it is not BMW smooth in the automatic mode.  However - I am loving the paddle shifters!  The greatest surprise is the gas mileage.  I easily get 23-26 in normal day to day driving (not taking it easy on the take offs) and 27-31 on long highway trips!"
car_2123,Love My Z,I love driving my Z along the beach with the top down. I have had some maintenance problems but it came with a six year warranty. The service from BMW has been great. The trunk space is limited but with duffle bags we have made some wonderful trips. I would not recommend this car to anyone only because I like having the most stylish car in the parking lot...
car_2124,Z4 Review,"This car is a joy to drive.  It is responsive, hangs on to the road, has a great sound, and runs through the gears beautifully.  The top works quickly and well.  It also is fairly quiet.  I love this car."
car_2125,RESPECT,"just bought this amazing roadster, let me tell you, if the car looks impressive in person that's nothing compared to the driving experience you get every single time you go out for a run! This control over pavement soars you above all drivers going or coming your way (no matter what their driving). I find myself not wanting to reach destinations so quick,so I take the longer routes to enjoy this magnificent piece of workmanship.I can only say to BMW: My respect to you."
car_2126,Driving The Good Life,"I feel my Z4 sometimes anticipates what I'm thinking. The power is there, the steering is true and the Z4 knows how to use it. When I get crazy and take a turn too fast it keeps me glued to the road. I know the longest way to any place in town and frequently hit the freeway & drive 20 miles for a cup of coffee. 70 degrees and the top comes down the music goes up. You'll know me when I pass, I'm the one with the big grin on my face. I've owned a Corvette and a porsche, honestly they don't compare.This auto never breaks down! Drive one, you'll see."
car_2127,Let it ride,"At 73 years of age, I'm enjoying the out doors more and more.  Fun to drive and be looked at.  Car moves out quickly, and handles easily.  A smoother ride than you would think from a car that's low to the ground."
car_2128,Dream Car under $50K,"I traded my Z3 in for this car and what a diffence.  I love everything about this car.  Everything that I felt could have been improved on the Z3 was greatly improved.  The power band is smooth thoughtout the range.  Handling is remarkable, it drives thru curves as if on rails.  It has a sporty ride but is still not uncorfortable on long trips."
car_2129,More than I expected!!!,"I just got my Z4 for my 28th birthday (16255 miles in excellent condition from one owner!) and I am very impressed.  This is my third BMW (currently own 06 330i and previously owned 03 325i) and with out fail it drives to my expectations. This car has every option except NAV and AT.  Good acceleration (sport mode) and remarkably quiet.  My wife was very impressed after the test drive and we got it!  The car makes a better impression in person, than through pics.  Interior is nice with remarkably good space, especially the trunk.  Now we have to wait for the spring (live in MD) to truly enjoy it, but that doesn’t prevent us from driving it on the weekends!"
car_2130,Z4 2.5 roadster experience,"I have owned two 03 2.5 Z4s. One manual and one with automatic.  Both have been excellent road cars and just a thrill in the hills.  Change to the automatic was for the wife's desire.  The automatic with the sequential manual shift works well and in general the automatic is easier in busy traffic.  Both vehicles have been outstanding from a maintenance standpoint which includes excellent support from the dealer.  While I would agree that the 3.0 would provide some extra horsepower, once you get the 2.5 rolling it delivers pretty well.  Gas mileage (though not a concern) has been satisfactory electric top works great and once seated is quite comfortable.  Only gripe is low top when getting in"
car_2131,You smile just thinking about driving it,"Near perfect balance of power, transmission shifting, suspension, road feel, braking and steering.  Power top quick enough to raise or lower at even a fast stop light without feeling rushed. Sound system brings out amazing detail even with the top down. Trunk space provides the ability to use this as my full time vehicle, easily taking two suitcases, a large duffel and a fully packed computer briefcase. My only suggestion is that a new buyer opt for wheels that have a minimum of tight spaces, as you're going to spend a lot of time dealing with the legendary BMW brake dust buildup."
car_2132,Now if only there were an M version...,"This car is a pleasure to drive, even around town.  I have the Steptronic automatic version as my wife doesn't drive a manual transmission.  Overall gas mileage is about 24 mpg with a couple of long, mostly interstate driving, trips coming in over 30 mpg.  We have taken this car down the Blue Ridge parkway from end to end and around Cape Breton Island, top down.  Pure pleasure!"
car_2133,BMW Z4,Love the car - the seats hug you and there is great back support. We have taken some cross-country trips in the Z4 and its been comfortable and fun to drive.
car_2134,Fun Fun Fun,"This is a great car for driving in the wind and sun.  At highway speeds you don't even get wet in a light rain or drizzle.  Handles like a dream on the curvy roads in Austin. Cupholders are a bit odd, but other than that it is hard to complain.  The 2.5 has plenty of oomph for the weight of the car, and the sport package was well worth it."
car_2135,Classic Roadster,"I've had this car for two years.  I bought it for my 50-something wife and she loves it.  She also lets me drive it quite a bit.  Living in So Cal, winter days and summer evenings are perfect with the top down.  One of the few small roadsters that looks good with the top up - much better looking that the Nissan Z, Boxster, or Honda 2000.  It's also the only one my size 6'3"", 240 lbs can drive comfortably, although it's a bit tought getting in and out with the top up.  It just had its 15000 mile service and the only trouble so far has been one side marker light that went out."
car_2136,"Fun, fun, fun 'til dad takes the Z4 away","I have owned my Z4 for almost two years, and have not had any major disappointments at all (see suggested improvements). The car handles well, it rides well, it runs well and it just fun, fun, fun."
car_2137,Recommended,No regrets! My 2003 2.5i has been a pleasure to own and drive for the past two years. The car remains tight without squeeks and remains trouble free! The manual top can be lowered or raised quickly and easliy with only one hand and glass in the rear window is nice - but why should you care because the top will always be down.
car_2138,Better than the 3.0,I'v tried the 3.0l and I didn't see a big difference in the power for the 10000$ you need to add to get the 3.0 compare to the 2.5. The 2.5 is more than enought with the sport package. I had some problem with the radio & amplifier and the automatic roof top after the BOOMERANG DEVICE installation be careful there is a lot of sensor on this car everywhere. Fun to drive and everybody think it's worth twice the price you pay... If you want to flash in a sport car it's the best one to buy but more than  everything else it's fun to drive. You can't not resist its race feeling. You will step on the gas after every stop sign. Enjoy
car_2139,Turning 50,"As the saying goes, when I turned 50 I 
had a choice between a toy car or a 
young bride.  My wife convinced me the 
car was cheaper than the divorce.  
It's also been a great deal more fun.

Though our New Hampshire winter's 
are ""wicked"" nothing beats having the 
top down on a summer day while 
cruising the seacoast.  And the Z4 is 
even comfortable for a cruise down to 
PA for a visit with the relatives.

So if you're turning 50 and have a 
craving for something fun and 
exciting, take my wife's advice (and 
mine) and buy the Z4.  You'll have a 
great time!"
car_2140,Fun car!,"I've had tons of fun in the car and 
it's not even warm out yet.  My wife 
was reluctant at first but she fell in 
love with the car too.  
It's just a ton of fun to drive!"
car_2141,You gotta drive it to believe it,"Long story short, I was so enamored with the styling and performance numbers that I ordered my Z4 3.0i via phone without a test drive. It's an awesome car that draws attention everywhere I go. To really feel the power, put it in Sport Mode and punch the throttle. If DSC gets in the way, switch it off. The stereo kicks too. Even the exhaust note sounds as if the engine is bigger than it really is. The automatic top is a crowd pleaser. Handling is solid and stable, and the ride is firm due to the sport suspension and run-flat tires. Test drive one or do what I did and just go buy one!"
car_2142,Fun is the word,"I've had my Z-4 for over a year and 
still can't believe that it feels like 
my first time driving it each day.  
People stare at this car wherever you 
take it.  I recommend the black car 
with red leather interior!!!"
car_2143,Better than an M3 Convertible,"Traded a 2002 M3 convertible and the 
Z4 is a significantly better handling 
and riding vehicle. I also own a M3 
coupe and the Z4 will out handle it 
but get blown away in the straights.
As many reviews have said, the looks 
grow on you. Gas milage is outstanding 
compared to the M3 conv and body 
integrity is much improved."
car_2144,2.5 Z4,"Excellent sports car.. great handling. 
Perfect with the Top Down. Although 
with it up you need to get used to the 
visibility. Value for money is very 
good. Much prefer the manual to the 
automatic, it makes driving it more 
fun."
car_2145,corners like  a snake,"The car is well built,corners like a 
snake and has impressive high end 
acceleration.However,my back seems to 
hurt a little on longer trips.I think 
its the gas pedal position being to 
close to the driver.Any other owners 
with this observation?"
car_2146,Love at First Sight,"This car makes every trip, even a run 
to the grocery store, a good time. 
Handling and acceleration are superb! 
The ride is what you'd expect in a BMW 
and a roadster - very firm, with an 
excellent sense of exactly where you 
are on the pavement. The interior is 
comfortable, although with the top up, 
a bit of effort is required to fold 
myself in. The exterior styling, which 
has been a subject of controversy, was 
love at first sight at our house!"
car_2147,WOW,"I HAVE DRIVEN ALOT OF FAST CARS, BUT 
THIS ONE SCARED ME THE FIRST TIME I 
DROVE IT.  I DIDNT THINK IT WAS 
POSSIBLE TO DO THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IN 
THIS CAR, AND THE BEST PART OF 
ALL....IS THAT EVERYONE STARES AS YOU 
GO BYE."
car_2148,What a great car,"It handles turns great and has great 
speed. Comfortable inside and looks 
great."
car_2149,Awesome!!!,"I was the previous owner of a 96 Miata 
and then the 99 Miata.  Going from the 
Miata to the Z4 was like going from a 
Ford sedan to a Cadillac!  The Miata 
got the job done and well done at that, 
but the Z4 is incredible.  It picks up 
where the Miata left off.  The ride is 
incredibly smooth even at high speeds.  
The storage space in great compared to 
the Miata.  A definite graduation."
car_2150,YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE OF THESE,The best I vehicle I ever bought
car_2151,BMW Z4 2.5I BRIGHT RED,"Purchased the BMW after test driving 
the Porsche and Benz convertibles. The 
Bmw is by far the better automobile. 
The BMW came with all options except 
the pop up dvd navigation system. Love 
the Z4! Handles like a dream, enough 
room for tall drivers (I am 6ft 5in) 5 
speed manual is smooth, engine 
performance is great! Dealer (BMW NW) 
were and continue to be excellent."
car_2152,Great Overall car,"Just picked up a 2003 Z4 after 
extensive research. This is my second 
BMW, second roadster (owned a Boxster) 
and am pleased so far. Handles great, 
good power and a blast to drive. 
Haven't had it long enough no notice 
any major problems."
car_2153,Eats Boxters,"Look at a photo - you'll hate it.  Go 
see one in the ""flesh"".  Hmmm . . . 
that looks different somehow.  A few 
days later . . . I gotta have one.  
Test drive it (forget the 2.5 litre).  
Did you once have a go-cart?  Then that 
seat of the pants feeling all comes 
right back. This thing stick to the 
pavement like velcro and runs up to 60 
faster than the factory claims.  Sure, 
you feel ever rut in the road, but is 
that bad?  Downsides? Well the glove 
box is just that . . just enough room 
for gloves.  Interior storage . . . 
what's that? Will your wife/girlfriend 
hate it? Yes.  Is that bad?  Not 
always."
car_2154,Truely AMAZING!,"This car is out of this world!The looks 
are amazing, so different and outragous 
when compared with the boring, old, 
Porsche Boxster which I tested and 
thought was no where near as good. The 
engine is so powerful and flexble.The 
noise of the engine is intoxicating. 
Mines black, black interior with 18 
inch star wheels. Got every option 
availible.The amount of complements I 
get is unbelivable, I also get alot of 
jealousy as people look in envy of a 21 
year old in such a HOT car. If your 
lucky enough to be able to own 1 forget 
about EVERTHING else! There really is 
no competition and i've tested them 
all."
car_2155,couldn't be happier,"This is my first bmw and i now 
understand the 'ultimate driving 
machine' tag.  It isn't just marketing 
hype.  This car is an amazing drive.  
No sway, great acceleration, both off 
the line and at speed.  I wasn't sure 
how the exterior lines would sit with 
me over time, but having owned it about 
9 months now, they don't seem as 
radical as they did at first 
impression.  All in all, I'm having a 
ball driving the Z4 and haven't once 
regretted buying the 3.0 version."
car_2156,Great Car Crummy Dealer,"Waited 40 years for a roadster, and am 
I glad I did. This one more that 
fufills dreams, it makes my wife happy 
too with the wood trim and heated 
seats. Top down and blasting on the 
premium sound Stepenwolf - Magic 
Carpet ride... the song was written 
for this car. San Diego BMW has me 
puzzled... they seem to be over-staff 
and don't have their 'act' together. 
Seems the other Beamer owner's are way 
to impressed with themselves. I'ts a 
car!!!"
car_2157,A big step up from the Z3,"The dealership gave me a Z3 to drive 
until my Z4 came in, and once it did 
arrive, I noticed a huge difference in 
both performance and ergonomics.  For 
one, BMW adjusted the front windshield, 
removing the blind spots on either side 
that were a constant nuisance with the 
Z3.  Another upgrade is the addition of 
a storage space that is positioned 
between the driver's and passenger's 
seats -- perfect for storing CDs.  Two 
suggestions: one, get the heated seats, 
you can crank those babies up and still 
put the top down when its below 60 
degrees out; two, get the 
electronically adustable seats -- I 
didn't and really wish I did."
car_2158,"Practical, luxurious, sporty all in one","Typical BMW handling, performance, 
technology, and responsiveness.  For a 
two-seater, this car makes you feel 
remarkably safe with 6 airbags, sturdy 
rollbars, stability control, traction 
control and absolutely fantastic 
brakes.  Surprisingly practical as an 
everyday commuter - good mileage for a 
spors car, more trunk space than you 
think, and of course it's a blast to 
drive."
car_2159,Pure Fun to Drive,"This is by far the most fun I've had 
driving.  I bought the Z4 mainly 
because I liked the design, but I have 
absolutely loved the performance.  
Definitely no remorse for this 
purchase."
car_2160,I love it!,"I am a first time BMW owner and I 
cannot believe how easy it was to fall 
in love with this car.  It's fun to 
drive, impressive and can quickly get 
you out of a jam (no pun intended) when 
it really counts.  
Although the car mags weren't too 
impressed with the Z4, I have to 
disagree.  The simple interior makes it 
sharp and functional.  It's a drivers 
car, you don't need any extra bells and 
whistles. I was and by far is the 
smartest deal I have ever made.  Nick 
Alexander Imports is an excellent 
dealership!"
car_2161,"Most fun, great value, man-toy yet!","Fewer features than my top of line 
Pathfinder, cost about the same, but 
much more fun to drive. If the sex 
appeal of the Pathfinder is that 
of ""bloomers in a convent"", this is the 
neatest ""thong in Rio""!  Have yet to 
drive it somewhere w/o someone 
commenting on how 'snazy', cute, sexy 
it is!  Abs love it!!  The friendly 
adoration of strangers offsets the open 
envy of some male friends!"
car_2162,WOW !!,"This is my first BMW and my first 
Roadster.  I was always a fan of the 
Z3 since my brother bought one in 
2001. His was stylish, powerfull, and 
a blast to drive. My heart was set on 
a Z3 and I was not very fond of the 
Z4.  Over time, it began to grow on 
me.  I now own a brand new 2.5L Z4 
Roadster and I love it!!  Very sporty, 
powerfull, handles great, and is a 
gorgeous automobile.  The navigation 
system is a little difficult to use 
but once you get the handle of it, it 
is fun to use.  The only problem I 
have with it is with the top up, the 
blind spot is a real problem.  Other 
than that, it is a beauty.  I highly 
recommend one."
car_2163,I love my car,"This is an upgrade from the Z-3 I had, 
I like the keyless entry and back glass 
window with defroster much better it 
just has a few more whistles and bells, 
seems to handle the road a little 
better, and I don't see one very other 
car like I did with the Z-3."
car_2164,"2003 Z4 - great , Dealer sucks","Wasn't in market for car (getting 
530i), but took a ride after hearing 
about dealer incentives.  Car is 
addictive; bought it.  Very precise and 
responsive.  Well worth the price paid 
(under $39k for loaded vehicle listing 
over $47k).

Only problem is dealer; salesman rammed 
it with a customer's used car a few 
days later (381 miles) when I took it 
back for a paint problem.  Now dealer 
acts like I don't exist.  Got an email 
into BMW North America to see how they 
handle it.  Meanwhile having to use own 
insurance to get it repaired."
car_2165,THIS IS THE ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE!,"This car is as close to perfect as I 
have ever seen. I previously owned an 
Acura TL, one of the ""sports sedans"", 
but nothing can compare to this car! 
You don't have to sacrifice much in 
the way of comfort and utility for 
this much style and performane. Many 
say the styling is ""controversial"", 
but it is really the most beautiful 
car I have ever seen. Though it only 
has 225 hp, my Z4 has beaten Corvettes 
with close to 400. I love the 
vicious growl of its engine in the 
cold morning air. I can't imagine how 
a 3000 lb. car with 225 hp can go that 
fast. Others cannot even compare to 
it. Wonderful BMW. This is the 
roadster to 
own!"
car_2166,AWESOME,"The z4 is an awesome car.  Not only in 
its drive and handling, but the cool 
factor is through the roof.  It's 
simply unique in its exterior design, 
and stands out beside all other 
roadsters out there today.  If the 
exterior doesn't float your boat, just 
go drive one.  Its amazingly punchy, 
and takes corners with no problem.  
Many people who have ridden with me are 
amazed at how you can take a corner 
at ""excessive"" speeds, without it 
jarring them into their side door."
car_2167,Great Car,"This is a great car.  It is put 
together well and very quick with the 5 
speed.  The steering is quick and 
precise and the upgraded stereo sounds 
great.  The car sounds great, just like 
a roadster should.  We also have a 
Corvette, and the two compliment each 
other well.  The Z4 looks, feels and 
sounds like something out of a Bond 
film, whereas the Corvette is like 
taking off in a rocket.  Highly 
recommended."
car_2168,FUN TO RIDE,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED MY Z4 AND I AM 
VERY HAPPY WITH THE AUTO.  I GIVE HIGH 
TO BMW FOR IT'S DESIGN EFFORTS AND 
BUILD QUALITY.  THE DESIGN IMPRESSES 
ME MOST FOR IT'S EYE CATCHING LINES 
AND STANCE.  IT IS VERY DIFFERNT IN 
SOME RESPECTS FROM OTHER AUTO THAT YOU 
SEE ON THE ROAD TODAY AND THAT IS WHAT 
APPEALED TO ME IN MY SELECTION 
PROCESSES."
car_2169,"Love it, Love it!!","I've wanted a convertible sports car 
all my life and I fell in love with a 
Z3 (by site only) back in 98.  When I 
could finally afford to buy what I 
wanted, I did lots of research and 
decided the Z4 was my best buy.  It has 
not only met all of my expectations, it 
surpasses them. I love the speed, I 
love the handling, I love the looks I 
get when I drive it!"
car_2170,Pure Roadster Experience,"A great car to drive and to maintain. 
Every feature is of high quality and 
reliable. The design is classic and 
will be as sought after twenty years 
from now just as the 50s Mercedes SL 
190 is today. The SMG (semi-manual 
gearbox) adds substantially to the 
driving experience.

The car is far superior to the Audi TT 
(the slowest roadster ever) and the 
SLK. Comparable are the Boxster S and 
the AMG SLK, but both are quite a bit 
more expensive. Thus BMW gives you the 
by far best deal for your money.

As an advice, do not save on the extras 
and get as many as you can. You will 
appreciate it later and every time ou 
get into your roadster."
car_2171,Immediate Gratification,"Traded up from a Mazda RX8. What a 
noticable difference in performance and 
handling. SMG performance is 
outstanding as is the acceleration in 
all gears. Auto top is quick and 
effortless. Gas mileage is averaging 27-
28 mpg! Fit and finish immaculate with 
no noted faults or defects. Wife loves 
driving it and likes the electronic 
seat adjustments and looks of car. 
Immediate gratification for the senses!"

except nav and cd changer.

So far a gas to drive.  handles and 
rides well.  nothing to complain about.

More later."
car_2173,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"I originally wanted to get Nissan 
350Z, but I'm glad i ended up with 
Z4.  My first experience with BMW was 
more than pleasant.  It handles very 
well, no wonder why people prefer the 
ultimate driving machine.  My Z4 has 
Sports Package, that gives you very 
good handling.  Do not underestimate 
the 2.5 liter engine, it will give you 
enough power.  Without realizing, you 
are already going over 100mph"
car_2174,Z4 3.0 6spd.,"The fun factor is a 10+. Very unique 
design all around which will get some 
raves as well as some critisism. I 
personally love it. Performance is very 
good. I would like to see a little more 
power. It handles excellent. The ride 
is a little bumpy but that's to be 
expected, especially with the run flat 
tires. Interior is roomy and 
comfortable. I'm 6'2"" and I dont even 
have the seat all the way back. 
Interior design is very simple and the 
aluminum dash is very stylish. I would 
like to see an oil presure and altmeter 
guage though."

Z4, the BMW was the most fun balance

car_2176,Baddest Little thing on da road!!!,"I recently had the opportunity to drive 
a z4 3.0 for a week this little thing 
is so responsive it almost feels a part 
of you...it corners like its on rails

AWESOME...either in auto or manual this 
little thing will gallop like nothing 
else....comfort was great, the GPS was 
awesome and stereo very 
impressive.Styling is unmatched!!! Very 
well built automobile!!!!! Get one if 
you can afford the $52,000 the model I 
drove was.....made me feel like a kid 
again."
car_2177,Lloyd's Ramblings,"Car has great features. Good NAV 
system. Excellent automatic wipers. 
Great top - when it is down the outside 
of the top is up. That gives it a 
finished look. The top is also fully 
automatic.
However - it does not handle as well on 
the freeway as my Audi TT Roadster. 
It is quiet inside with the top up (The 
top is nicely lined). It has a ""Sport 
Button"". When pressed, it really 
accelerates. 
It has reasonable interior storage. The 
controls are well arranged."
car_2178,Ultimite Fun To Drive Again,"I remember when I was a teenager

This is how I feel again driving this 
car! I don't mind traffic, long red 
lights and I just want to keep driving 
and driving!!! Thank you BMW!!!!"
car_2179,BMW Z4,"This car is absolutely an amazing 
machine. I wasn't too sure about it at 
first, since I never liked the Z3's but 
the design drew me in. I previously 
owned a 325ci coupe, and was going to 
trade it in for a 330ci convertible, 
but I decided to take a look at the Z4 
since it was so gorgeous. Once I test 
drove it, I knew I had to buy it, so 
then and there I signed the papers and 
I couldn't be happier today!"
car_2180,buy it in red,"buy it in red, get at least 18` wheels 
and it looks very muscular. perfect 
performance, better than a boxster, no 
comparison to sluggish slk much more 
refined inside than a S2000."
car_2181,Land Shark,"I purchased a 3.0 titanium silver Z4 
last month with the sport package.  
Absolutely the most enjoyable driving 
vehicle I have ever owned! Smooth 
ride, great sound system, this ""land 
shark"" is really quick.  Incredible in 
the turns!!! The automatic top is very 
easy and fast. Destined too be a 
classic with the new body style. Looks 
like a piece of art rides like a 
luxury sedan. Only thing I can think 
of that needs improvement, it could 
use more than one power port."

car size, fun to drive, outstanding 
value, maintanance included!"
car_2183,What a sweet ride!,"The 3.0 is fast and has great handling 
features.  The sport package is nice 
with the 18"" wheels and the sport 
control which makes the car even more 
responsive than normal.  Love the looks 
and sound of the car as it handles 
every twist and turn.  This is a true 
sports car and not one of those plastic 
clones.  It is a big plus that BMW is 
going to pick up the tab for the 
service over the next 4 yrs or 50k

car_2186,Z-4 SENT FROM HEAVEN,"AFTER DOING SOME EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON 
THE AVAILABLE ROADSTERS, I NARROWED MY 
SEARCH THIS PAST SUMMER AND SELECTED 
THE 2003 Z-4.  THE CAR IS NOTHING LESS 
THAN A REAL JOY TO DRIVE.  THE 2.5 WITH 
MALDIVE EXTERIOR AND BEIGE TOP/INTERIOR 
DRAWS LOOKS FROM EVERYONE WHEN I AM ON 
THE ROAD.  OPTIONS THAT I PUT ON MINE 
INCLUDED THE PREMIUM AND CONVENIENCE 
PACKAGES ALONG WITH AUTOMATIC TRANS. 
THE MOTOR HAS A DISTINCT GROWL THAT IS 
UNIQUE. KIND OF LIKE WHAT A HARLEY 
OWNER FEELS WHEN HE/SHE IS ON THEIR 
HARLEY.  TO SAY IT THE BEST, THERE IS 
NOTHING NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR.  IN 
MY 25+ YEARS OF DRIVING, IT IS WITHOUT 
A DOUBT THE MOST ENJOYABLE DRIVE I HAVE 
EXPERIENCED."
car_2187,Driving is Fun Again,"I tried the Z-3, and found it bland in 
styling, a tight fit physically, and 
short on some of the features I wanted 
in a sports car.  The Z-4 responds to 
all of these issues: it is eye-
catching, easy and comfortable on all 
kinds of roads and for long distance 
touring, and has an up-to-date set of 
power accessories, GPS, sound system, 
etc.  It is a car for those who enjoy 
interacting with their machine."
car_2188,Most Fun Car on the Road,"This is without a doubt the most fun 
car I've ever owned.  Handles 
beautifully, plenty of power, and great 
looks.  Got the 2.5 with manual 
transmission.  I was shocked when the 
dealer said 80% are sold with automatic 
trans.  Why would anyone buy a pure 
sports roadster and get an auto?"
car_2189,My BMW Z4 is a pure joy,"I've owned my BMW Z4 for about 5 months 
now and I can say that is has been more 
fun than I thought it would be! I 
realize there is this difference of 
opinion out there between the Z3 and Z4 
fans... Mind you, I could have 
purchased either or, any car for that 
matter. The new Z4 in my opinion blows 
them all away! Sleek and far sexier 
looking than the bubble styling of Z3. 
Performance is AWESOME to say the 
least. Just to start her up is 
exciting - That low growl. She handles 
beautifully! Under the hood is 
perfection! This car is truly pure joy."
car_2190,The best bang for your buck,"I had the Z3,wow what a difference a
year makes.Every time I'm at a traffic
light,people tell me what a cool looking
car this is.Performance is incredible."
car_2191,the best ever,"I have had sport cars in the past, 
never this quality nor with this 
performance.  Getting on to the freeway 
is a breeze now, getting over in the 
right lane to get off is the same.  The 
handling is tight and the car just hugs 
the road in turns.  The best part is 
how fun it is to drive.  Everybody I 
know wants a ride, they want to drive 
it....not happening!  I have too much 
fun driving it myself.  Never in my 40 
plus years have I ever had something I 
enjoyed driving as much as this!  Sigh 
me mother of four and it's my turn!"
car_2192,BMW Z4 Driving Review,"Z4 BMW is by far the best sports car I
have ever driven. The 3.0 has excellent
power while still offering tremendous
fuel economy. A recent 6 hour trip on
interstate highways yielded 30.1 mpg. My
Z4 is equipped with the Navigation 
System and On-board computer, so the
mileage reading was exact. Average speed
was about 56 MPH with jaunts up to 80
MPH staying with traffic (had to hold
back..the Z4 wants to go!). The Z4 is
solid as a rock, with no body vibration
and sticks like glue to the road
surfaces (rough and smooth alike). Also,
I love the style and scalloped side
panels. Somewhat reminiscent of the 50's
and 60's early Corvettes. I love this baby!"
car_2193,COOL,"It's a fully loaded pretty affordable 
sports car. It has awesome features and 
a nice ride. I love it."
car_2194,Red Z4 by JLV,"I have about 2200 miles on my RED Z4.  
It is small but has the feel of a 
larger car.  The 2.5 has plenty of 
power.  I have AT with premium, sport, 
and convenience packages.  Get all the 
packages you can.  The trunk is 
adequate but other storage is 
minimal.  A great car and a lot of fun."
car_2195,Ultimate Driving Machine,"Have always heard BMW's claims to make 
the ultimate driving machine.  Have 
never drove one before, but after test 
driving sports cars for a full year and 
settling on the Z4, now I know why BMW 
says that - it is the ultimate truth. 
This car handles great, takes curves 
exceptionally well, punch the gas and 
this car takes off!  Interior is 
extremely comfortable, fuel economy 
good, especially on long drives.  Drove 
from Alabama to Outer Banks, NC for 5 
day trip and everything fit in the 
trunk - most spacious by far.  We go 
out in the evenings just to drive the 
Z4 because it truly is fun to drive."
car_2196,a purist drives the basic 2.5,"I'm a cyclist and a bit of a purist.  I wanted the 
basic 2.5, no fat, no options or packages---
the pure car.  The standard car has a zenlike 
simplicity and ergonomic design.  Manual 
operation of the soft top is an elegant 
operation that compares in speed and 
smoothness with the automatic.  The manual 
seat adjustments are light as a feather. The 
""leatherette"" seats have an athletic, textured 
ruggedness that I prefer to the creamy-
looking leather.  

Without any distracting electronics, you focus 
on the driving.  What an athletic, agile, road-
gripping drive!  You can't help smiling as you 
accelerate on the curves and enjoy the sky 
meeting the mountains.  Pure joy."
car_2197,tony review own car,"This is the best all around sports car 
I have ever driven. Z cars make vettes

could want, if you are into that. I am 
a private pilot and compare airplanes I 
fly to my Z."

compliments and attention."
car_2199,Fun Convertible Sports Car,"This is my first BMW but my 2nd 
convertible car.  I previously had MB 
SLK.  But the performance and handling 
of SLK didn't even come close to my new 
Z4.  The designing style of Z4 is 
definitely nice and aggressive."
car_2200,Z-4,"I am a long time BMW driver, absolutely
fell in love with this vehicle.  I
bought the vehicle fully loaded:   The
premium sound system is terrific, the
push button top is a breeze (but who
would EVER put it up in good weather) --
the seating is better than my 3-series
for tall drivers/passengers ... and, the
larger trunk space in the Z-4 as
compared to the Z-3 made it possible for
me to purchase since I travel a lot for
business.Makes you look for excuses to
drive.

I purchased from Chad Barton

every time I drive it. (hint for those 
that need to convience the wife on 
buying a sports coup; Subtract your age 
from 83 and plead with the wife that 
you only have that many years left to 
live. ""Life is too short not to have a 
Z-4"""
car_2202,enjoy driving,"I've always owned a Mercedes, this is 
my first BMW. This Z4 is a real 
performance car. The pleasures of 
driving this vehicle comes from the 
triptronic and the fully loaded Z4 
thatresponds like a cat. My experience 
with Mercedes was a luxury ride but 
this is a well engineered machine.
The two downsides are the seatbelt does 
not rest comfortably and the interior 
is on the small side."
car_2203,Fun to Drive Roadster,"I've had the car for a little over a 
month now and very happy I dicided to 
go with the Z-4. The horse-power is not 
bad for a 2.5 liter engine. I drive on 
Atlanta roads and as some of you may 
know, Atlanta is full of hilly and 
windy roads. Eight months of warm 
weather will make the soft top a joy 
for a good portion of the year. Love 
the fully auto top and smooth shifting 
5-speed. After a couple of scrapes with 
the front spoiler, I finally adjusted 
to leaving more space pulling up to 
curbs. BMW is notorious for heavy brake 
dust and the crevise filled rims make 
it difficult to clean. Great car."
car_2204,How to get a smile on my face?,"I was looking for a convertible for 
quite some time. When the Z4 came out, 
I immediately thought I can stop 
looking. Love the looks, and love the 
performance even better. I had wanted 
to keep my old car since it was paid 
for, but after driving the Z4 for a 
couple of weeks, I simply had to sell 
the old car. Now I am buying a truck 
as my second vehicle because I simply 
refuse to drive anything else. Drive 
one and you'll know what I am talking 
about."
car_2205,BMW Z4,"Just moved to the Z4 from the 740IL.  
Quite a change, but a wonderful one.  
Still feel the sturdiness and 
responsiveness of a BMW, but a lot more 
fun to drive."
car_2206,Amazing,"I love this car!  It's fast, looks 
great (gets TONS of attention), feels 
solid and has an intoxicating exhaust

car_2209,1998 Z3 1.9 Purchased in 2017,"What a HOOT!!! It's got 160K miles on it.  I purchased it as a ""toy"" and not a daily driver (although I find myself driving it more often than not).  I'm 6'3"" and about 260 and I have ZERO problems fitting into the car!! Now, I will say that because I'm ""long waisted"" in that most of my height is from my waist up...with the top up I have to crane my neck to keep from bashing my head on the convertible top...but with the top down?  NO problem!!    I certainly would recommend one if you find one that's clean.  Used prices are MUCH cheaper than Honda S2000's.  The performance on the 1.9 is lackluster but it's in essence a motorcycle engine!!  Buy you a Bimmer!! The Z3 is fun to drive!! Even with a 5 speed!!!"
car_2210,The day I bought my Z3,"I bought it in 1998. If I had a choice I would without a doubt do it again!!! when I pulled in our drive, my neighbors ran over and ask if I had won the Lottery! I did not tell them That the total price out the door from the dealership tax etc etc was $30,040.00.  l loved the car then and I still do. I am am 81 years old and my Z3 is 19 years old.  Pete Hadler"
car_2211,What A Ride!!!,"Bought this used about five years ago.  No... REPEAT NO mechanic issues to date.  Enjoyable drive, sharp look.  In short,  I'd buy this car over and over again."
car_2212,Classic Roadster Formula Updated,"When this car first came out I was in grad school and was smitten by the styling.  So once I graduated and got a job, I bought one!!!  It's an awesome little roadster.  It corners flat and with the 1.9 you don't have enough power to really make it loose it's composure. The 1.9 z3 has adequate power with the manual transmission and very good handling.  I'd avoid the automatic b/c the engine does not provide enough torque.  Having test drove a MR2 spider and a Miata, I prefer the Z3.  It's better looking, better value and is extremely comfortable. Oh and my gas mileage has to be around 35mpg.  I drove a 2.3 (slight improvement) and a 2.8 (seriously quick), but in the end preferred my 1.9"
car_2213,Hot stuff,"This is a jazzy car. It looks more like a cartoon car from Roger Rabbit, than a street vehicle. Lows, fuel economy, tired back window.  Highs, ride, look, reliability."
car_2214,Love this car,"This is a keeper. It is fun to drive, has classic looks and seems to work most of the time. I have had to have a seatbelt replaced, replaced one sensor, and had recurrent problems with an annoying buzz in the bass speaker and have problems with one of the electric seat motors. The sound system is weak for a car this nice and the plastic window in the rag top is pretty cheap also. But overall it is a well built fun car. If you find one in good shape buy it and keep it."
car_2215,First Sports Car,"I had always wanted to own a Corvette, but when I reached the point where I had the cash to buy a sports car I opted for a BMW.  My decision was driven by BMW's reputation for quality engineering and workmanship.  Having owned a couple of BMW motorcycles and having ridden them from coast to coast and border to border more than once, I figured that a Z3 had to be a rugged machine if it was built like the motorcycles that roll out of the BMW factory.  Driving a Z3 is just as much fun as riding a motorcycle and you get a lot more respect.  BMW did a fantastic job of sculpting the sheet metal -- the car does attract attention where ever you drive it.  I'll take my Z3 over a 'Vette any day."
car_2216,Z3,I purchased my Z new in 1998 strictly as a toy. It is driven no more than 1000 to 15001 miles per year. I absolutely love how it performs on the back roads. We take it on weekend getaways during the summer and fall looking for challenging roads to use it to its full potential. It is a blast to drive and people who see it always have plenty of comments on how great she looks.  Bring the original back!!
car_2217,Best car I've ever owned.,"Fun, fun, fun. I bought this car used with 50,000 miles on it and drove it for two years and never had a problem with it, not one thing broke. The only thing I did was do oil changes and put gas. I would have still it if the car wasn't manual transmission and I didn't live in Miami (traffic is horrible here). Clearly the Z3 is one of BMW's best built cars."
car_2218,"I love it, but.....","I bought this car, because of it's looks and the price was fantastic!!! I love this car but, let me prequalify, my issues should be more with the previous owner than the manufacturer. The side window gaskets leak something terrible! So much so that the driver's side floor board is soft and spongy. The person that had changed their oil had left the small oil filter gasket in the filter housing on several occasions which resulted in the rings wearing out with time and crumbling into small bits all through the system and developing in a nasty oil leak and cost over $600.00 to fix. The hoses pop off for no apparent reason but, these do not detract from this beautiful car, in my opinion."
car_2219,My M roadster,"This car is awesome! I purchased the M Roadster version of the Z3 which includes more horsepower(240hp) with a slightly larger 6 cyl. engine and a sportier suspension. The car drives and handles amazingly as if you are glued to the road. The performance is excellent with one flaw being the fast reving when your hard on the gas.the gas milage is decent when your not hard on the driving. The only problem I have had is the amount of room in the cockpit area. Movement is limited but that's what you expect with a 2 seat roadster. The two-tone black and blue leather interior is beautiful and goes very well with the silver paint. If you're looking for a Z3 but want a little more, check out the M!"
car_2220,What driving should profess to be...,"Overall I would rate this car a definite buy with a few caveats.  First, take a close look on all the repair work done on this vehicle.  As most 1998 Beamers will have over 100,000 miles, I would be aware of what has been done and what is needed to ensure no surprises and fun in the sun.  Make sure all 30,000 mileage inspections aII have been performed along with upkeep with the interior and tires.  In addition, I would check all BMW's part recall information such as the thermostat replacement.  My experience with the Z3 for the last 4+ years has been great.  The car has a great engine and I feel the handling is decent.  If you do your homework, you'll be very happy..."
car_2221,Too Much Fun,"I am having a ball in this car.  I've driven it roundtrip between Key West & Rochester, NY. Extremely comfortable for 14 hour days on the road. I just picked up my Christmas tree in it last weekend (top down, of course!) I want to tour the West and see the stars at night!   Can't wait to go.  If you want to be treated like a celebrity, drive this car!"
car_2222,Ice Cream Runner Z3,"My wife had to have it. We imediately 
replaced the loose seats with 
aftermarket and it's been a joy.  Tops 
are easily fixed or replace and it's a 
looker.  Inexpensive fun and 30 mpg.  
Exactly what we wanted.  Pleasant 
ride.  Manual tops seem to work better 
with these models. Give one a try."
car_2223,Fun car to drive,"I just bought this car in 10/03 and I 
absolutely love it!  For a 98, it looks 
and handles great!  I test drove it on 
the west side of Cincy on curvy SR 
roads and it was an instant sale.  The 
only problem I had was replacing 
several seals on my convertible 
top/front windshield, but I guess that 
should be expected with a 6 yr old 
convertible.  I had to drop $2000 the 
first month I owned it and now another 
$500 for a carb sensor, fan or 
something.  I knew the maintenance 
would be expensive, but that hurt a 
little.  Even with these costs, I still 
love the car (as long as another $2K 
bill doesn't come up within a yr)"
car_2224,1998 Z3 2.8 Roadster,"Best car I ever owned (until I bought 
my 2001 740iL).  Still turns heads 
today even though it's seven years 
old.  If you have the 17 in. wheels, 
avoid driving in winter --traction is 
nil.  The 17 in. wheels differentiate 
the car from others.  Engine, 
drivetrain, fit and finish have been 
outstanding.  Poor air conditioner and 
stereo --those are the most 
disappointing features.  The absolute 
exhilarating driving experience makes 
any flaws minor in comparison.  I am 
extrememly happy with my decision and 
would buy this car again."

car_2226,BMW 1998 1.9 L Z3,"This has been an amazing vehicle.  I 
have never had any drive train problems 
and in fact it runs as well today as 
when I bought it 6 years ago brand 
new.  I feel the styling of this car is 
best of any roadster on the road!  As 
small as this car is the ride is 
amazingly comfortable; the footprint is 
wide and the car is heavy.  It handles 
like it is on rails!"
car_2227,Reliable,"Not a commuting car, a fun car!"
car_2228,The Ulitmate Driving Machine-Ask 007,"Have the 1.9 4 cyl. engine and has 
plenty of power and oomph.  Not as 
fast as the 2.3 6 cyl. or the Audi TT 
however this car is a ""touring car"" 
first and not a sports car. Its looks 
and handling make it a blast to drive 
and quite an eye catcher.  All in all 
a great value.  Top speed I am told is 
around 130 mph however vehicle is 
electronically limited to 115 mph.  So 
although some have complained about 
the 4 cyl. engine it begs the question 
do you really need any more for a 
roadster??"
car_2229,Built on a Friday,"My Z3 was in the shop about 20 some odd 
times.  The problems ranged from 
leaking softtop, blown thermostat, 
busted sending unit, and so on.  Fun to

car_2234,'98 Z3,Fun to drive.  Always dependable.
car_2235,As close to perfection as you can get,"Of course the M roadster is perfection 
but the 2.8 L Z3 is as close as you can 
get.  My heart wanted the M roadster 
but common sense prevailed. With the 
stiffer suspension in the M Rodster and 
the thought of replacing tires at least 
once a year I opted for the 2.8 L Z3.  
This car is my daily driver in 
Washinton D.C. and I love it.  
Maneuvering in traffic becomes a joy in 
this car.  Its quickness and nimbleness 
is unparralled.  Perfect blend of power 
and comfort!!!!!!!"
car_2236,The Ultimate Driving Machine,"I had this car for 6 months and I am 
very happy. It turns heads and is truly 
fun to drive with the top down. Engine 
is willing and car is quick, once on 
the freeway, more torque is needed for 
the 2.8."

right car, a 98 Black on Black with a 
remov hardtop & Auto (i know, i know... 
I did say it was for my wife didn't I? 
Besides, it has a decent manual shift 
option) I buy and sell up to 100 cars 
per month so cars are pretty much a 
commodity to me. But, this car gets ME 
excited! Stylish, powerful, agile, and 
shhhh even affordable, don't tell 
everyone or the cachet will be lost. 2 
mos after handing her the keys, and my 
wife is still grinning."
car_2238,BMW Z3 2.8 (6 cyclinder),"This car is a dream come true. I grew 
up with friends who drove used MG's, 
Triumph's,Sprite's,and even one 1960 
Austin-Healy 3000.I wanted a sports car 
that didn't need so much attention. I 
bought a 1998 2.8 Z3 last year. It is 
the most incredible car I have ever 
driven.It has more power than I will 
ever need, and is incredibly agile. And 
even though there are some ""roadster 
type"" cars on the market with more 
powerful engines, none are anywhere 
near as beautiful and stylish as the 
Z3.The Z3 is The Roadster Defined.It's 
as if those others are just poor 
imitations.Bottom line,it is so much 
fun to drive, that I even enjoy driving 
to work, and I work at the Post 
Office."
car_2239,After three years it still turns heads!,"A great car to show off in - performance or styling. I have the 17 in. wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. It takes 25 mph curves at 55 with no loss of traction. 0 to 60 in 5.1 sec. with the 2.8 liter engine (don't get the 1.9L). Really now, is there a better looking convertible for sale today???"
car_2240,Fun for 6 mos so far,"This is my first BMW and convertible.  
I was not sure if I will like a 
convertible, but this car is so 
comfortable with top up or down (my 
usual mode of driving), that I wish I 
bought a convertible earlier.  The car 
has all the comforts/techno gadgets I 
was looking for, and all work well 
together.  Handling is superb, and the 
balance of performance, handling, and 
comfort is extraordinary.  I highly 
recommend the car to anyone looking to 
get into this type of vehicle."
car_2241,A New Z4,"The car hugged the road like glue. 
Drove @80 - 90 mph from Italy to 
Austria. Excellent handling on the 
curves & surprisingly quiet - even with 
the top down. Comfortable even after a 
4 hour drive."
car_2242,my Z4,"I'm in love with my Z4, its 
comfortable, fast, controllable, and 
elegant. I love seeing everyones jaws 
drop seeing me in it. Never have I had 
a car so nice. If you're thinking about 
getting a car, get a Z4 for the 
ultimate luxury sports car and an 
affordable price."
car_2243,Z4 3.0i  Does it get any better?,"I have had my Z4 3.0i w/sport 
package/button for approximately 7 
months.  I traded my Mercedes SLK 
Sport.  If you don't want to talk to 
people at stop lights then don't buy 
this car!  This is not a car for shy 
people.

Overall, a great handling car in all 
aspects. I commute 1 hour each way to 
work and the Z4 is fairly 
comfortable.  The trunk space is 
pretty good and realistically holds 
one set of golf clubs and a few small 
bags while still allowing the top to 
come down.

If you are getting the 3.0i, be sure 
to spend the extra $$$ on the sport 
package.  The button really makes the 
car even more fun to drive."
car_2244,Waited a long time to buy another sports,"I haven't looked for an excuse to drive 
my car since I sold my 1981 TR-8. The 
Z4 is like my TR-8 on steroids. This 
car is awesome. Fast Sleek and sticks 
to the tarmack like it is on a train 
track. Most all today's cars look 
pretty much the same. The first time I 
saw the 2003 Z4, I was hooked!"
car_2245,BMW Z4,"My major complaint is with the low 
front spoiler. It scrapes on any bump 
or steep driveway. Very poor design for 
the road.

Also, should be able to start in sport 
mode and not have to switch it on every 
time."
car_2246,Great new design,"Having owned a Z3 for three years prior 
to purchasing the Z4, I have a sound 
basis for stating that the Z4 is in a 
whole different league.  It is a much 
higher quality vehicle with 
sophisticated design and luxury 
accessories.  Performs at or near the 
top of its class.  Very likely the best 
value in the under $50,000 category.  A 
sports car truly worthy of bearing the 
name BMW!!"
car_2247,Smiling in Miami,"I've had the car for about 6 months 
now and have enjoy every minute of it. 
the car is allot of fun to drive and 
everyone wants to talk to you, even at 
lights. I have the 3.0 with the 
sports, premium and convenience 
package."
car_2248,really well built,"I traded a 2002 C5 on the 3.0l z4-
everything but nav system. Big time 
driving fun with the 18"" wheels, etc.

A mini-van rear ended me at 20 mph-I 
did not get hurt. I had no frame 
damage or bags deploy and I had the 
car back in 10 days. Have that happen 
in your Miata, etc. and call me from 
the hospital.

The critics may hate the style, but 
John Q. Public does not-extremely fun 
to drive so if it looked like a 
Checker cab why would I care?

Only bitch-if you fail to turn gas cap 
two clicks, check engine will come on."
car_2249,z for me,"all the zip you could want. sport 
package a must for back road driving. 
fair amount of room for long legs. wind 
noise with top open is not 
objectionable,consider optional wind 
deflectors."
car_2250,very good car,"it's fun 2 drive it's pleasure 2 be 
driven in and best of all it's fast
it's just the best car I've ever driven"
car_2251,Wow!,"Best car I've ever driven or owned.  
Exceptional performance coupled with 
outstanding comfort--comfortable seats, 
plenty of leg and head room.  The sport 
package gives you two cars in one as 
far as ride goes.  Feels more 
substantial than the Boxster (I've 
always preferred the BMW ride over 
Porsche's) and the Mercedes SLK (which 
had little leg room and made me feel 
boxed in).  Wind noise is virtually 
eliminated with the top up, and is 
minimal with the top down due to the 
fact that the driver sits so low in the 
car."
car_2252,Juicy,"Awesome totally perfect top speed of 
200 320 watt sound system and 400 
horse power."
car_2253,"So far, so good","I have about 6k so far on this hog and 
have not had any major complaints. My 
wife uses this for her daily driver and 
is happy with it. I drive it 
occasionally, but would not recommend 
it for anyone over 6'for a daily 
driver. I'm 6'3"" and have to find 
my ""comfort zone"" everytime I get in 
the car. Most times it ends up being 
with my right knee crammed against the 
dash.

The 16"" wheels are a pain in the 
derriere to clean. Takes at least 10-15 
minutes per wheel to toothbush out all 
the brakes dust. A terrible design from 
a maintenance standpoint."
car_2254,Surpasses expectations.,"I was drawn to the Z4 because of 
it's bold exterior styling.  I knew the 
engine, etc., would be everything you 
could expect from BMW.  
    I found a sterling gray, with the 
luxury package and some other extras 
for 37K even.  The car is a dream--
extremely responsive steering, and 
you're in total control with a standard 
transmission.  The dynamic stability 
control has kicked in a few times, but 
I've never experienced the lightweight 
feeling in the rear wheels you find 
with some other convertibles.  
This car hugs the ground."
car_2255,BMW's Best Car Yet,"I have owned five BMWs including a 
2002,320i,530i and two Z3s. This car 
is the most fund to drive and has the 
best build quality of any of them.  It 
is more solid than a Boxster, and 
almost as nimble as an S2000-but much 
more comfortable."
car_2256,BMW gets it right this time.,"A great driving experience at a 
reasonable price. Excellent blend of 
comfort, performance, styling and fun 
as long as there is another more 
practical vehicle available when the 
weather is poor or space is required."
car_2257,New Z,"I traded a M roadster that I had really 
liked, but I don't miss is. Lost a few 
ponies but the gains far outweigh that. 
Handling, rigidity, styling, comfort 
and features are all improved."
car_2258,Love to Z4oooom,"So far, I have had this vehicle for 2 
weeks.  Let me tell you, it is FUN.  
There is hardly a time that I do not 
have a big old grin on my face driving 
this down the road.  The only bad part 
so far, is it has been raining here a 
lot, so I have only had a handful of 
Top-down days.  But, I take advantage 
of those days and look forward to more!"
car_2259,Great Car,Smooth to drive and very fun inside.
car_2260,Rather have a Z,"No more Beamers for me. I switched to 
Nissans Z, much better, more power too. 
BMW sucks. My Z came for a fraction of 
the price from the Z4. Computer 
faiulures are a daily hassle."
car_2261,"You drive, you buy....","Great car, get all the optionals you 
can.2.5 engine have more power than you 
think you need. You never get tired of 
driving it."
car_2262,First Drive,"Took delivery of my Z4 3.0, 6sp man. 
with performance and convenience 
pkgs a month ago.  Outstanding 
from all aspects from the dealer 
service to the driving experience.  A 
surprisingly comfortable ride (17"" 
wheels - non-sports pkg - which is 
not missed), conveniences, and 
everthing works as it should with 
even some pleasant surprises."
car_2263,Heaven on wheels,"This car is a real gem to drive.  
Turns heads at every stop light.  The 
stereo is sensational, handling 
superb, and the auto trans shifts 
flawlessly. Purchased 18 inch after 
market wheels, a must for overall 
appearance and improved handling. My 
99 Z3 is an after thought compared to 
this sweet gem!  Keep it up! Maybe the 
best is yet to come... I can't imagine."
car_2264,Perfection at its Best ...,"I looked really hard at the Boxster 
and the CLK430, but I finally decided 
on the Z4. The overall feel and drive 
of the car is absolutely thrilling, 
yes even more so than the Corvette and 
the Boxster Type S!

I've had this car for about a month 
and I love every moment. It's such a 
great experience that I try to find 
any excuse to go out take my Z4 for a 
spin. So if you're looking for a 
(great looking) car that has 
everything and is priced reasonably, 
then the Z4 is for you."
car_2265,Most fun I've had driving a car....,"I was in the market for a roadster, 
and was somewhat skeptical about the 
reviews I was seeing for the Z4.  
However, I was quickly convinced after 
the test drive I took down a hilly, 
winding road.  The car I test drove 
was a 2.5 without the sport package.  
Still, I was duly impressed.  A few 
weeks later, and I now have my own 
WITH the sport package.. WOW! is the 
best way to describe it...."
car_2266,Former Z3 owner gets a Z4,"It's my 2nd BMW Roadster, and all 
I can say is WOW! It's as if BMW read 
my mind.  The Z3 is a FANTASTIC car, 
but it had its flaws: Plastic rear 
window, anemic stereo, squirrelly rear-
end, too much body flex, etc.  BMW 
listened and fixed EVERYTHING!

I've had the car for a week (Z4 3.0, 
sport package, premium package, etc),
and with each passing mile my smile 
only gets bigger.

Overall, I'm in heaven.  This car is as 
close to perfect as I can find.  It's 
11:00 at night and I just got back from 
another pointless run to the 
market for something I didn't need.  
Excuses to drive are easy to find.  The 
car is just too sweet to let sit."
car_2267,"oh boy, do they oggle my car....","Also got a great deal on a fully loaded 2.5 Z4 
(minus the upgraded stereo system) - got it 
below MSRP. It is such a smooth ride 
compared to the TT, the SLK, even the Porsche 
911. The handling is great. Very responsive 
steering, it's zippy! It is also a very solid car. 
The top goes up and down so fast, in about 10 
seconds. The trunk space is huge for a 
roadster. Get all the packages you can afford, 
it is worth it. The only thing is, if you can 
afford the 3.0 you should get the 3.0, 
although the power on this baby is definitely 
good enough! and it has cupholders!"
car_2268,Best car yet,"I recently purchased a Z4 and I love 
it!  I constantly hear compliments from 
other motorists on a daily basis.  The 
back roads of PA have never been so fun!"
car_2269,Z4 2.5i update,"This is one great Roadster.
Highly recommend"
car_2270,Bad build quality,"The Z4 is a build in USA, with poor 
build quality. The car built in Germany 
is better."
car_2271,Value oriented roadster,"Traded '02 Corvette as I wanted a car 
a little more feeling like an old 
school sports car with a litle muscle 
car feel.

Corvette is a five second 0 to 60 car 
that handles well, but can't get over 
speed bumps and every kid in a 5.0 
Mustang(Mustangs are a great buy)feels 
they must race.
This car gives up a few tenths 0 to 60 
and is not a contender in the quarter. 
However, on the twisty roads it is 
more fun than the C-5; I think a 
better value than the excellent 
Boxter. For 60 k the Boxter S can't 
compare to the Z06 with 10 K left 
over."
car_2272,BMW Z4,"Great car to drive, handles very well, 
looks impressive, and a real babe 
magnet."
car_2273,My wifes valentines present,"I love this car.  I bought It for my 
wife as a valentine present and she 
really enjoys driving it.  The only 
problem that I have seen is that the 
factory paint job does not reflect a 
$40000. vehicle. When we picked it up 
from the dealer it was obvious that he 
hadn't checked it out because the 
drivers electric seat wasn't working."
car_2274,GOZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Great car.  Originally owned Z3, and 
this is a much stronger roadster.  In 
my opinion a good cross between the 
Porsche and Mercedes.  Very satisfying"
car_2275,ZED vs BOX,"Well, what'll it be?  The ZED or Boxster? I wanted to buy a ""high-end"" roadster for my wife's birthday recently.  The Boxster has an uncanny sense of balance but, the ZED is faster, has much more torque, more responsive, more civilized, newer design, has more safety options, and plain sexier than the Boxster. Topless in the sun, tunes blasting from the absolutely fantastic audiophile Carver sound system.  What could be better therapy?  Sunshine, Miles Davis tooting his horn, top down, and high-speed corner carving on one of the Car & Driver?s Top Ten Roads, in a drop dead gorgeous Sterling 3.0 litre with the Sport Button engaged!!! Is this a great roadster or what?!!!"
car_2276,2nd Z,"Fun of a roadster; has features 
of ""real cars"""
car_2277,Watch 'em Stare,"Got a great deal on a fully loaded 2.5 
Z4. They do sell them below MSRP. The 
ride is fantastic as is the handling.  
Took it yesterday in the mountains with 
plenty of winding roads.  Couldn't get 
a peep out of the tires.  Drives like 
it is on rails.    I can clearly tell 
the difference on winding roads with 
sport pkg. 
The Carver stereo refuses to quit.  
After 200 miles in the mountains 
yesterday I wanted to drive more.  The 
only sore things were my ears from too 
much music.  It got 28 MPG to boot.
W/ top up the cockpit is very quiet.  I 
get looks everywhere I go.  I now like 
waiting at lights just to see who's 
staring."
car_2278,So much fun,"We tested the Boxter, S2000, TT, 
Thunderbird, 350Z and Mercedes SLK 320 
before settling on the Z4 2.5, with 
nearly all the available options. We 
made the right choice.

Two months into ownership, we love the 
car more now than when we picked it up. 
It performs spectacular, especially on 
corners and in acceleration. It gets 
stares and comments wherever we go (a 
guy in a 4WD pickup hollered 'nice car' 
at a stoplight just yesterday.

It's surprisingly comfortable for a 
roadster and so much fun. My wife uses 
it as her every day car and loves it."
car_2279,What FUN!!,"This car is just plain fun to drive. It 
has made my commute something I look 
forward to as I get in the car. 
Questions pop to mind like, Will I have 
a clear run through the onramp to 
really floor it? and  How many waves 
will I get today? If you can afford to 
have only two seats and are ok with a 
big smile on your face when you drive, 
buy this car."
car_2280,Land Shark Dominates!!,"The absolutley best car I have ever 
owned!!It's all and more than they say 
it is!"
car_2281,The Ultimate Driving Experience,"This is a fun car to drive. Ergonomics 
are great, with the exception of the 
plastic cup holders.  Expect lots of 
stares as you cruise or zoom the 
roadways."
car_2282,Z4 rocks!,"My experience to date has been nothing
short of magical.  This car demands
attention even when sitting in a parking
spot!  My Z4 is Jet Black with the tan
interior and conveys an image that
equals BMW's ""Land Shark"" advertising. I
don't think BMW will have to worry about
the Z4 getting the 'woman’s car'
reputation like the Z3. As a 6'4"" driver
I am amazed at the head and leg room. 
It is a credit to BMWs adjustable seats.
 The 2.5 liter, 184 hp engine (coupled
with the 5-speed manual transmission) is
more than enough to put this car through
its paces."
car_2283,GoBMWZ4,"Outstanding fun car, excellent 
performanceon interstate roads and the 
backroads also. I was most suprised by 
the fuel economy (bonus) and the 
comfort on a long trip (over900 
miles).A true sports car at good value."
car_2284,V4 3.1liter,"Beautiful car.  Attracts much attention 
and approval from other motorists.  
Solid and substantial.  Difficult to 
get into but once in the great seats 
hold you in much comfort.  Wonderful 
smooth engine but this is not unusual 
with BMW.  Smart interiar and clever 
design on the outside of the car with 
the wandering creases."
car_2285,Z4 review,"Tons of fun to drive.
Lot's of room.
Great performance.
Everything you could possible want in a 
sports car/Roadster."
car_2286,And the Golf Bag fits...,"I bought the Z4 back in December with 
all options included. There seems to 
be a few loud people out there that 
don't like the new style, but I for 
one find the new BMW look more 
appealing. I find the combination of 
looks, performance and luxury 
outstanding. It's nice to see a 
roadster with navigation, a working 
trunk, and even cup holders."
car_2287,Best car I'd ever had,"This is my third BMW and my third 
sports car. I had two corvettes in the 
past. This car is totally unbelievable, 
a dream to drive and look at.Powerfull

bottoms and gadgets. Sleek design in 
and out.Best car in the market for the 
price."

car_2290,It Will Teach You to Drive,"Performance, Speed, and Handling are 
all tightly integrated with a great 
user experience.  As the road 
conditions became more demanding, I 
found that this car responded at each 
opportunity better than I anticipated.  

After driving this car for awhile, it 
struck me that BMW needs to market this 
machine in this way:

""IT WILL TEACH YOU TO DRIVE"""
car_2291,"IF YOU DONT HAVE THE BMW Z4, BUY IT!","it is ausome. especelly at firebird 
racway (phoenix, AZ). Ive always liked 
nice cars, but this is beyond nice, 
this, is the next Aston Martin 
vanquish. No doubts about it!"
car_2292,"IF YOU DONT HAVE THE BMW Z4, BUY IT!","it is ausome. especelly at firebird 
racway (phoenix, AZ). Ive always liked 
nice cars, but this is beyond nice, 
this, is the next Aston Martin 
vanquish. No doubts about it!"
car_2293,Dream Machine ...,"Very fun to drive. The edgy exterior 
style is wonderful. Interior is very 
spacious and comfortable. Major 
improvements over the Z3 include Run 
flat tires, which allow much bigger 
trunk space, thus making it a more 
practical car. In addition, the back 
window is glass, rather than plastic, 
which comes in most convertibles. The 
seats are much bigger, with much more 
leg/shoulder room than in any 
convertible I've seen. You need to 
drive with the top down on a cold day 
to appreciate the heated seats option. 
Power top is a must-have.Interior guage 
style has been redesigned. Sound system 
is simply incredible."
car_2294,Noises....,"The car is fun to drive but I have had 
some issues with the powered Top. After 
2 opennings, the Top broke on the left 
part.After 1 month, there was a noise 
in the motor. The seat belt of the 
passenger is making noise against the 
door when nobody use it. The Top 
does a small crispy noise when it is 
down."
car_2295,Awesome....,"Outstanding handling & acceleration, 
2.5 liter engine is adequately powerful 
to leave SLK & Boxster behind, great 
looks,  and excellent service at 
dealership"
car_2296,BABY BOXSTER BEATER IMO,"NICE FIT AND PROGRESSIVE LOOK.
REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST AUSTIN HEALY 100
FROM THE DESIGN POINT OF VIEW. GREAT 
HANDLER AT .91 DRAG. AND FASTER THAN 
THE BABY BOXSTER."
car_2297,A roadsters roadster,"Great drop top roadster. Very fun to 
drive, secure and comfortable with 
excellent handling."
car_2298,Substance and Style!,"The Z4 does everything well. The build 
quality and performance are 
overwhelming. If you are looking for a 
two seater convertible, drive this car 
and bring your checkbook."
car_2299,Best bang for the buck,"This is truly an amazing roadster.  It 
undercuts the Boxster by $8K and it 
outperforms all other roadsters in it's 
class.  I have thorougly enjoyed 
driving it."
car_2300,SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE...A  SHOWSTOPPER,"I have owned six different models of 
BMW's over the last 24 years but this 
is by far away the most fun to drive.  
I would never consider a Z-3 but the Z-
4 is so cool and ""begs to be driven"".  
The suspension system is unbelievable; 
the braking system is phenominal.  The 
seats are very very comfortable and I 
am 6'1.  This is a an automobile that I 
will keep for a long time.  A great car!"
car_2301,Hott,"Best car to drive, but you pay to play!"
car_2302,Sweet........,"This car has excellent handling and 
when engaged in Sports Mode it feels 
like a totally different car, great 
engine response. This is definitely a 
head turner!"
car_2303,Juliewestlake,Juliewestlake
car_2304,Just purchased Z3,"Just purchased 1999 BMW Z3, one owner with 94,000 miles. Fun to drive, very responsive, my 1st sports car and exciting for 70 year old plain vanilla guy. Far exceeds my expectations for performance and overall quality and condition of a 15 year old car. I may keep this one for a lifetime since NC resident and can been @ blue ridge mountains in less than 3 hours and beach less than 4 hoursOwned my 1999 Z for two years, drive it weekends and to the NC Mountains, only has 96,000 and in mint condition. I really enjoy the car and put just a few miles on in each year it performs exceptionally well."
car_2305,12 years later and it still turns heads,"I leased this car new in 1999 and it was so great I bought it at lease end in 2002.Now 2012 and all I have done is add a front strut brace (highly recommended and simple to install) and the car is still the best I have owned.Steel Grey, chrome package, with chrome wheels is unbelievable.I store it in the winter. Never seen snow, barely seen rain. 30k miles. And i drive it hard, run it to rev limiter regularly, etc.It's like driving a go-cart, not for all but for enthusiasts really great.Fun to drive, amazing exhaust note and the engine runs easy at 4k and will just hang there between shifts. Even today, as 12 year old car, people stop and look and ask.Timeless for sure."
car_2306,"99 Z3 Roadster, 2.3, 5 spd manual","Great solid car, extremely reliable for me.Bought it with 122k on it, sold it with 140k.Needed front suspension parts replaced, which is no surprise with that many miles, but did the work myself and found that aftermarket parts are cheap online.Only real issue I experienced was the airbag light came on.Good gas mileage, and the straight 6 cylinder motor sounds awesome!Stereo is absolutely horrible.Mine did not have the optional Harmon Kardon stereo, which I assume is better.Would recommend this car - very classic and sexy looking exterior.Simple interior."
car_2307,Cruising Top Down,"Sweet looking car. It's very quick and nimble. Drove it 5,000 mi this winter from Florida to NH. Handles great in snow. With cruise control got over 30 mpg traveling 75 mph. Love to drive around with top down and wind in my hair."
car_2308,"Never sold in Canada, got one anyway","The base 2.8 Coupe was never sold in Canada. I bought my 99 in 2007 in western NY, 49xxx orig. miles. It now has 77xxx miles. It's now in its third Canadian winter. Only failures have been PCV valve and battery. Replaced the water pump at 54xxx miles before it broke (they all do). Unbelievable attention getter. Mine is one of 3 in our city of about 1 mill. Fantastic to drive in all conditions. Have a good set of snows on it, am only stopped by 6"" or more dumps of snow, and then only until plowed. Heater is great, love the heated seats. If you don't want attention, then don't drive this car. I get questions and offers all the times. Chicks dig it."
car_2309,THIS is BMW quality?,"My '99 Z3 (bought Feb '08, 48K miles) still looks great on the outside and powertrain has held up well.  Surprised that interior plastic parts are so chintzy, such as loose power drivers seat, cup holder cover, and cracked/broken seat belt restraint and parking brake handle. Radiator fan shroud also cracked and broke off.  6-CD changer in trunk has poor tolerance for bumps.  Would not have expected all these issues at 49K miles."
car_2310,Fun car for the money,"Fun to drive,  good on gas,   good quality product. Only major problem is with the sealed gas tank system. After the dealer put 2 gas caps on it and looked at it several times the warranty ran out and then they said I had a leak in the gas tank filler neck. They could not repair it?? They said I had to buy a new tank for around 400. I purchased a code reset reader and I turn off the code every times it tells me I have a leak. I do this from 2 times a month to sometimes only once in 3 months. I called the home office of bmw and they did not want to help me with the problem. I should have insisted they fix it when the warranty was in. Other than that I enjoy the car."
car_2311,FunFunFun!,Most fun to drive I've ever had.  This is my sixth BMW and makes me feel good every time I look at it or drive it.
car_2312,Enjoy the Sunshine,Overall I love driving this car.  It is great for the  Florida sunshine.  The 2.3 model has plenty of power when you need it and the gas mileage is close to 35 mpg on the highway.  The top is cheeply made and needs a glass window.  I also have problems with the fuel sensor malfunctioning regularly.  It is a blast to drive around town but use another car if you are going on a long trip.
car_2313,Beyond all expectations,"I bought this car on my birthday, and 
never looked back.  When looking to 
replace an 87 325is,  I stumbled upon 
the coupe.  It's always fasinated me , 
when I saw it on the lot, I asked for 
a test drive.  That sold me.  It is 
the tightest handling, most stylish 
and unique car I have ever owned.  
Most people have buyers regret after a 
any new car.. its a big purchase after 
all.  I had NONE.  By the way, get 
used to people staring and pointing.. 
there were only a few thousand of 
these made.  I drove it through the 
WORST New England winter I have ever 
seen, and it handled it with aplomb.  
If you have the chance, buy it."
car_2314,Individual style flawless performance,"Z3's give a great modern 
interpretation of a classic roadster. 
We all know how they look so I’m not 
going to talk about that. With 70,000 
miles of New England driving I can say 
I have had few problems. I bought my 
2.3 from lease trade in. My dealer 
replaced the front control arms after 
I test drove the car. I noticed 
nothing wrong in the test drive so I’m 
not sure why they replaced them but I 
guess I can just be happy they did. 
The only other item was the air bag 
light came on at about 55,000 miles 
and to turn it off the seat belt 
receptacle needed to be replace for 
$400. The rest has been change oil and 
filers and brakes just normal 
maintenance"
car_2315,Wow...i like,"Used to own a '97 2.3L Z3....this 2.8L 
is much better.  The power behind this 
car is incredible, it's very fun to 
drive.  The added roll bars provide 
better security.  The seats are 
incredible:  heated, holding 
capability, and comfort all rolled into 
one.  Not very practical, but that's 
not its purpose.  It's a very fun toy!"
car_2316,A Sportscar for the real world,"If you can and do push this car to it's 
limits on the street, you are driving 
the wrong car in the wrong place. If 
you want a car that looks great , makes 
you feel good every time you drive 
it,and has the comfort for a long 
trip,then this is the one. The inline 
six will pull strong in any gear so 
shifting is almost optional. The car 
stops - now - without being grabby. I 
have had no problems in 22k miles. We 
just drove the BlueRidge Parkway, I 
think the road was made for the Z3."
car_2317,Good...not great..Handling BMW,"First, let me say, I love this car.  It 
is fun to drive and handles very VERY 
well.  However, bumps in the road will 
defintely throw this light (2900lb) 
vehicle.

Outside of that and the cupholder being 
in a very odd place, the car is 
perfect.  The engine sounds wonderful, 
the interior and exterior detailing is 
beautiful.  The engine runs smooth as 
silk and corners very nicely.  Oh, and 
if you must indulge in this car, do not 
forget to find one with heated seats!"
car_2318,Z3 coupe,"BEST CAR EVER MADE IN THE WHOLE 
WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST 
EVERYTHING."
car_2319,your classic roadster,"loads of fun to drive, corners as if on 
rails, but can be a bit rough over road 
imperfections. has all the essential 
features of a classic roadster plus 
modern conveniences, automatic top 
operation, a/c etc. still draws the 
looks from everyone, works fine as an 
everyday car for most days (i don't 
take it out in the snow to avoid salty 
roads). you can even lock it with the 
top down due to its anti-theft device 
(location dependent of course) as all 
storage compartments can be locked 
independently. a perfect car for the 
young exec/professional seeking a 
significant other or for the empty 
nesters."
car_2320,Drive One!!!!,"Very smooth, agile, and fast.  I am 
glad I got the 2.8, worth the extra 
cash and the extra torque makes the 
difference.  Still have not been able 
to break it loose, I will keep trying. 
This car is a keeper!"
car_2321,Drive One!!!!,"Very smooth, agile, and fast.  I am 
glad I got the 2.8, worth the extra 
cash and the extra torque makes the 
difference.  Still have not been able 
to break it loose, I will keep trying. 
This car is a keeper!"
car_2322,beats up on boxters,"Handling is amazing, i corner it as hard as possible and the tires just won't break lose, freeway ramps feel like astronaut training. The unusual styling grabs to much attention at times
it seems almost everyday someone asks ""what is that"" Some people just rave about it others just don't get it.
I'm going to make some modifications, new chip, exhaust and intake and take it to the next level."
car_2323,Little Red Z,"Fun car.  If you are taller than 6'3, it's a little tight."
car_2324,Couldn't ask for more!,"I just got my 99 2.3 a month ago and I smile every time I get in to drive it. Performance is smoother than expected, which is saying a lot. If you want to enjoy driving and don't have to worry about hauling more than one passenger, you can't go wrong with this car."
car_2325,Bought 3 BMWs,"I have bought 2 Z3 models and they have been the best rides and fun ever. Everyone seems to love the style of the vehicle. Recently bought 328 series and it is junk, the emblem on the front blew of and chipped the windshield, electronic windows dont work, front panel cracked and the door handles are melting in the Florida sun. I will keep my 2 z3s because I love them but the 328 has to go...."
car_2326,96 z3,"purchased used around 2000. fun to drive, handles great and mpg close to 30 hwy. some things to look for if buying. 1 interior door pulls/handles have a tendency to come off (very poor design IMO) replacements very expensive 2 check seams on top and around window, if you can't see them they aren't there. meaning a replacement also expensive. 3 top WILL leak but most convertibles do LOL 4 my clear coat first clouded then flaked off. 5 know a good mechanic, not because it breaks frequently, but so you don't get gouged if it does"
car_2327,No put down,"Owning a 1996 for many years, I can't say one bad thing about it.  When you buy a car , do your research.  Don't buy,  then find fault. Edmunds is the place to start and end in my opinion.  Honest chatter only. This car, after becoming a sports car fan back in 1966, is a keeper.  Owned jaguar 140 1957, porsche 911, spitfire triumph,  etc. This car is the true top down , smooth going country backroad car. So was the jag. Ha. I am over six foot, 250 pounds and this can rail the corners, Safely.  Retired, there are plenty of sites that can save you money.  Many miles later and still Loving it ! The door pull broke, super glue fix, perfect! Replaced window switch, very cheap and easy. Still running like a top! Close to 170,000 miles no burning oil. I change it now just once a year. Use synthetic. If you want a reasonably priced Sports car I personally wouldn't look for any other than a Z3. The 1.9 engine will now burn rubber , yet it will keep the cornering interesting. A true country back roads car!"
car_2328,Old fun,It is Not British
car_2329,Gotta Love this Car,"I love the review that has a long list of problems with this car and then gives it four stars-you have own one these to understand.  I find mine to be just like one of my grown kids - you love them dearly and they keep asking for money.  When I brought my ""new"" car to my mechanic of 20 plus years he just smiled and said, ""it's gonna cost ya!""

It has been a very long time since I drove a car just for the fun of it.  It's my second roadster - the first was a new 69 MGB - and this one is even more fun."
car_2330,Cruisin with my Z,"I love my Z a Jet black on black. I bought this with 100k miles on it, this is one great car. Great looking car and still runs excellent!!! I have no problems with the top because this year it was manual. BMW is the ultimate driving machine. Just cruisin with it... California way"
car_2331,Great Value,"After having a Porsche Boxter (loved it), I tried a Mazda Miata and was disappointed. When the opportunity to purchase the Z3 came along I grabbed it. It has been a wonderful car and predictably reliable. The rear alignment has been problematic but besides that a great car."
car_2332,Amazing 2 Seat Convertible,"I've had my Z for about a month now and have had nothing but pure joy.  Styling is amazing.  So sleek and smooth.  No doubt it has aged perfectly and will continue to age much better than the the Z4. People will ask what year it it is and I tell them to guess. Their average guess is 2002 lol.  Lots of people complain about performance, but luckily mine came with a supercharger made specifically for the 96' Z3 and boosted the power to 225hp.  Yup that's right horsepower more than the 6 cylinder.  Handling is perfect,  you can go around a curve at 50 miles an hour when it suggests 35 with ease and comfort.   All in all a great car that will age perfectly and last forever."
car_2333,"Fun, fun, fun","The four cylinder Z3's may not have the oomph of the later six cylinder models, but it is fast enough to get one a speeding ticket!  On the other hand, I believe the handling is lighter and better balanced without the extra weight of the six cylinder in the front.  The four cylinder wants premium gas, but gas mileage is great! And, yes, people do stop and ask about the car or look as we drive by.  The BMW dealers are expensive for service and/or repairs.  But dropping the top on a sunny day and cruising the back roads makes it worth while!"
car_2334,A Really Fun Car,"Now about to turn 9 years old, my Z-3 is just as much fun to drive as when new. I still get ""thumbs up"" and compliments from strangers (aged from teen to senior) on my ""ride."" It is a bit underpowered which shows climbing some of our rather steep hills or in the mountains, but that is minor compared to the superbly balanced handling - lost in the front-heavy 6's in my opinion. The interior has a few cheesy touches - especially the center console which would embarrass a Yugo - but is roomy and comfortable. Plus it has a real trunk with room for a week's groceries or a week's worth of luggage (softsided)."
car_2335,Great Car for a short while..,"The car is excillent for getting
noticed and for the looks.However, when
things mechanically go wrong, it seems
like anything less then $500 isn't in
the question.The trunk
does leak, Engine rattles like no other,
and the ride isn't very smooth at all
for being a BMW.  Trust me when i say
you feel EVERY bump or rock in the
road.Other then that its a very fun car
and its great to be noticed in!"
car_2336,Truth about the early Z3,"Had Z3 2 years now, bought 
used.  Door handle 
pulled off/common defect.  Light switch 
is a pull 
switch, but the snap-on cap that covers 
the screw-on bolt is also snap-on.  Duh.

Location of window controls 
in center console results in shorts 
because it's next to shifter and gets 
dirty.  Windows sometimes don't roll 
up/down.  Cat. Converter bad, rattles 
like mad.  Top rattles too.  Trunk 
leaks.

This was a factory approved used car.  
I've talked to others who have cited 
similar experiences.  Maybe an older 
model you buy will have these things 
fixed, maybe not."
car_2337,2 seater fun ride,"The z3 can be described as the ultimate
fun cruz when it comes to driving on 
curving mountain roads in western 
North Carolina. This sports car hugs 
the road like a suction cup, no sway or
bounce just sheer control, not near as 
enjoyable on expressways with 18 
wheelers towering above the little 
car.All in all a very enjoyable car to 
drive."

car_2339,This is what a roadster should be.,"Pure top down, wind in your face, diving 
pleasure.  There are other convertibles that 
offer more in the way of raw performance, 
but none that just work so perfectly together 
-- it's much more than the sum of its parts.  
And you can drive the daylights out of the 
1.9 liter motor without losing your license."
car_2340,Good to buy used,"The prestige and handling sell it. 
Paid 31k in 1996. Ironically, if you 
can afford a new BMW then you cannot 
afford to waste time bickering with the 
BMW [no] service center. Z-3 not 
comfy. for >6 hr.s 
I'd projected a loss of $2k per year 
based 
on previous BMW's but perhaps because 
of teh volume of production the loss 
has been around $3k per year for the Z-
3 and greater for the 328. Otherwise, 
very happy with the BMW cars.
Happy driving, Tim"
car_2341,Lotza Fun,"Great performance even with 1.9L.  
Sticks to the road - it takes a LOT of 
effort to make it slide in a turn.  
Fun factor = 10."
car_2342,The best car in it's class!,"Many people call the 1996 BMW Z3 
underpowered because of its 4 cyld
engine, but my friends, they are wrong 
on every count.
The body and engine work as a team, 
providing on of the fastest cars in its 
class (4 cyld).
NOt only is it the perfect body of a 
sports car .... it's a powerhouse!
I fell in love the day I saw the BMW Z3 
the first time on the road, I was 12 
years old at the time, but I knew that 
day that the Z3 was the only car for me.
Six years later, I own my dream car ... 
and it's everything I immagined it 
would be, and more.
Don't let engine freaks talk you out of 
buying the 1996 model, just because it 
says 4 cyl doesn't mean it can't feel 
like a V12!"
car_2343,Z3--best value in pre-owned roadsters,"I am the 3rd owner of a well-cared-for 
1996 meridian blue (James Bond's car 
from Golden Eyes) Z3.  With 49,000 
miles on it the only thing needed has 
been routine maintenance.  I avg. 
30/mpg using premium fuel.  While the 4 
clyder engine could use more power, it 
does well with the 5-speed manual 
transmission. Definitely just a 2-
seater with room for one suitcase or 
two travel bags. Drives and corners 
superbly.  Will replace it in a few 
yrs. with another Z3 but with the 2.5L 
motor.  BMW dealer service is expensive 
with an oil change costing $72."
car_2344,Found a '96 with 18K miles,"Had few problems with this car.  Both 
the roof and trunk leak. Difficult to 
shift into first.  Engine revs 
beautifully.  People treat you like you 
are driving a very expensive and exotic 
car."
car_2345,Careful - 1st Model Year!,"This was my dream car - or so I 
thought.  Styling's beautiful, but BMW 
missed the boat on designing this car 
for longevity.  The car has literally 
been falling apart since it was about a 
year old...roof leaks, pieces falling 
off the dash, the door handles pulling 
out of the door, seat belt locking, air 
bag light staying on for first 5 
minutes after starting the car.  And, 
of course, once the warranty was up, 
the worst starting happening...and it 
costs a fortune to fix!"
car_2346,My Z3 is fun...but it can be improved,"Bought my Z3 used with 40k miles and 
mint overall condition.  It is very fun 
car to drive and the top should always 
be kept down.  Most people that say 
this car is too slow never drive it 
properly.  The M44 engine must be 
driven with the revs up above 3500rpm, 
which can be labeled as annoying for 
some and fun for others."
car_2347,Z3 - Fun to Drive,"The 1.9 engine might be underpowered, 
but the car has plenty of pick up.  The 
drive is very comfortable and smooth.  
This car is top down driving at it's 
finest.  I've been getting about 31.5 
MPG.  It's very reliable and a pleasure 
to own."
car_2348,COOL CAR,"Well the BMW Z3 is the best car I have ever seen, this is the car i would 
only drive. If you are going to buy a car buy the BMW Z3."
car_2349,cool car,it is very fast and very cool
car_2350,Constant compliments!,"We traded in a baseline model 2003 Porsche Boxster for this 2012 BMW Z4. Everything about the Z4 blows away the older model Boxster except handling. While the Z4 is still stellar on hard turns due to its Sport and Sport+ suspension modes, it weighs 500 lbs more than the Boxster and feels like it'll fishtail if you don't have excellent control of the accelerator. The Boxster felt like it was pulling you around corners. The Z4 makes you have to pull it around corners. Subtle distinction, but noticeable. Definitely don't regret the trade in though. It's faster than most muscle cars off the line (not a new Stingray though). 0-40 mph before you can blink, and the auto- and paddle-shifting are FAR faster and smoother than you could ever possibly do with a manual transmission. I've owned Mustang 5.0s that weren't this fast off the line, including a Shelby GT.The looks, sound, power, and technology of the Z4 are phenomenal. Just don't get in a wreck with it, you won't win."

car_2356,"Timeless roadster lines, a true pleasure to drive","It's the most fun I have had in a car, and I have driven a Porsche Carrera among other sports cars. The look of the car is the perfect blend of classic roadster shape and form with modern design and sleekness. It's not as fast off the start as I would prefer, but it has wicked acceleration at speed, dismissing some wannabe on the interstate while already doing 70 or 80. At 120 (the fastest I've dared take since it was a public road) it still has more to give. One time my wife and I were stopping in an art district shopping area. When we pulled over to park there was a young boy of 4 or 5 with his mother on the sidewalk, and through the passenger window we both clearly saw the boy say with a slow awe, ""That's a *fast car*."" That pretty much said it all; the classic yet modern look, with enough performance to back it up. It's pretty much a dream to own."
car_2357,Never Selling It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this car from a dealer in distress, they got a shipment of Z3's in December, 2000, they had snow drifts up to 12 feet and the Z3's were not selling . I got the car delivered to my home, 1300 miles away, for about 60 % of what the local dealers were getting for this car . In a little over 16 years of ownership, no problems yet . I get offers to sell the car every time I take it out ."
car_2358,ole blue...[non-permissible content removed],absolutely love this car.   i am 6ft 4 in.  got the seat all the way back and no issues.  runs like a dream.  i did research and parts is parts concerning repair. i scrounge the parts yard and have scored on z3 interior parts.  have a tool box full of mechanical parts also. so far only 1 coil pack went bad.  interior is good so long as you stay on top of it. use leather conditioner and the seats will fit like a glove.  there is a site for bmw's that  give the build date and what options it came with.  i actually traced it to the original owner and he was surprised to hear about it.   don't plan on parting ways with this car any time soon.
car_2359,"My first Bimmer, My first manual","First thing's first, and this goes without saying, the car is absolutely gorgeous. I found my 2001 on a Chevy lot, and it blew all of the modern designs of the new lines of Chevy out of the water. (except for the new 'vette, which the previous owner traded the z3 in for) Prior to buying this car, I only had practical experience driving a manual. It was years since I last tried. But within a week, I had it down with the Z3. This car performs so well, you can't help but drive it. The vehicle's handling is superb. You could do a turn on a dime with this thing, and NOW I understand why U turns and curved roads are just so damn fun to drive on. Nice low purr to the engine. The dealers told me the convertible top didn't work, but after actually reading the car's manual, I found out it worked just fine. The ride is smooth and the cabin noise is minimal. I'm not looking forward to the eventual repairs that I know are necessary for a 15 year old car, but I'll definitely thoroughly enjoy every day up until then.A couple of cons with my particular vehicle: Passenger side door won't open from the outside. In the car's maintenance history, there's a work order that showed repairing the door would be a $600 job that required disassembly of the whole door. Also, there's a slight leak in the roof on the passenger side. The CD player skips on bumpy roads.Minor inconveniences for a ride this exciting."
car_2360,"4-Star Car, 5-Star Fun!","I'm the third - and likely last - owner of our Z3. Paid well under the $7,500 asking price (125k miles) when a BMW Dealer pre-sale inspection (do this!!) found $6k in bad rear trailing arms and old/cracked/leaking critical engine parts/seals. A good independent shop did it for $4k. Was it worth it? OHMYLORDYES! This is the Roadster my old Miata always wanted to be. Takes my breath away every time I open the garage, and again every time I open the throttle. The S52 engine is the best of the bunch. Just be prepared to pay a premium to fix all the nits that crop up. Resale values are rising for later models in good repair. If you find one under $10k this looker is definitely worth a 2nd look. *update* Edmunds asked for an updated review. The only thoughts to add are frustrations with a shot rear transaxle now, and the realization that while it's fun, it's not an investment. For the money I've invested in purchase and repairs I could have gotten a very nice used Miata, with fewer headaches. *update* Drive shaft replaced at 165k miles, $1,500. Still mostly happy."
car_2361,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This is my forth BMW having owned a 320iS, a 528e, an M3 and now my beloved 2001 2.5 z3. I have also driven a Porsche 911 and a Corvette and this z3 is perhaps better than all the others combined. It certainly handles as good or better than any car I have ever driven. The looks are classic ""old school"" roadster and the BMW marque is well respected throughout the world. I would not hesitate to recommend the z3 to anyone looking to add fun to their driving experience. And finally it has been a huge hit with our two teenage daughters and of course their mother. The pick up driving son is not yet convinced it is a fit mode of transportation."
car_2362,Instant classic,"Bought my Z3 in December 2009 - have owned it for 8 months.  Love the styling, performance, ride & handling.  Purchased extended warranty & glad I did.  It has already paid for itself.  Issue with emissions, front bushings & ball joints, motor mount replaced, 1 window lift, fan clutch, alt tensioner, & water pump.  All this would have cost $4500 - only $500 with warr.  Key remote has been flaky - will not fail when at dealership.  Having said that - it always starts and I drive it every day on my  70 mile commute.  Love the car, gets lots of comments - a real head turner.  Getting close to 25 mpg with mostly highway driving, some local (80/20)."
car_2363,I Miss My Girl,"I bought my car in 2001 brand new!  In 2009 some hater totaled it in the blink of an eye.  I literally cried for 3 days. I didn't lease it I bought it as an investment. I had it 8 years and 3 of those years it was paid for.  I loved driving my bimmer - we were one. Her turning ratio was fantastic,  pickup speed fabulous and just and all around classy car."
car_2364,Fun to drive,I bought my 2001 Z3 3.0 a month ago & have loved every minute of it.  Very nice ride & comfort for a roadster. The I6 is very quick & responsive.  Very tight and solid ride with no rattles.  Averaging about 24 mpg mixed highway and city.  Very quiet for a convertible.  Top is very tight.
car_2365,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This car has been great fun at a low cost.  You can find a Z3 in great condition at a reasonable cost.  It is a real enthusiasts car, with excellent power, great handling, and smiles every time you get behind the wheel."
car_2366,Great looks & Great drive,"Purchased 2001 Z3 3.0 June 2008.  Car is in immaculate condition.  Test drove in the rain well.  Tight handling, stiff ride (fine with me!), and exciting response.  Doesn't blow around on the interstate.  Answers the need for speed quickly.  The 5 speed manual transmission is great fun.  I am enjoying driving it very much even though I have to keep wiping the drool from my friends off the car."
car_2367,Handles like it's on rails,"I have taken my z3 to Sebring, Robling Road and Road Atlanta race tracks. I love the way it would build momentum as you flow the track. My best times have been Road Atlanta 1:22.06 / Sebring 2:13.59 / Robling Road 25.98. The only thing that has been done is some computer work, and air intake with proper maintance care; before and after track days"
car_2368,I love it!,"It took me 8 months to find the vehicle I really wanted. So there was nothing stopping me from flying to Florida and driving back to Georgia. I had the top down 80% of the way and loved every minute of it. This car is so much fun to drive! It zips in and out of traffic, plenty of get-up-and-go, grips the road and handles smoothly. More comfortable then I anticipated even after the 8 hour and 45 minute drive back."
car_2369,"My little ""ugly"" coupe","I bought my 2001 Z3 coupe about a year and a half ago.  It has never stopped turning heads (one of the reasons I bought it in the first place).  The car performs the way one would expect a BMW to perform... with elan and enthusiasm.  The styling is what I love about the car, above performance.  It's been described as looking ""like a high top tennis shoe"", but that's usually with an appreciative smile.  The car has been very reliable, as one would expect from this manufacturer.  I expect I'll keep this car forever... after all, since the coupe is no longer manufactured, it will only become more unique with the passing of time."
car_2370,First BMW,"I recently bought and certified this car. This is an ultimate driving machine. Not only does it run and feel like a roadster should, it comes with the looks and ladies too."
car_2371,my beamer,"This car is so much fun to drive, my wife refers to it´s economy as ""smiles per gallon"". It has the feel of the road and agility of a sports car you would expect,but still rides like a much bigger car. There is no rough ride or road noise like you get from a Miata. It looks so damn nice parked in my yard it makes me smile just looking at it."
car_2372,So much fun for so little money!,"Long front end, so don't park into a curb. Tight and quick steering. Great acceleration with the smaller 2.5! Great braking. Fun Roadster!! Quick power top!"
car_2373,Slammin' style and great to own!,"Beats all other small convertibles. I tried Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Mercedes, Fiat, MGB, VW, and so on. I also own a 528i, but I'm not biased at all. If it is a great car, I say so. This is a phenomenal  car. I work on it myself, but really, nothing has gone wrong...except the motor for the top. The design is such that water backs up (from clogged drainage holes) with debris and floods the top's electric motor. Water vs electrical component? Water will be the destroyer of every pump, every time. BMW knows, now, that this is a poor design. I relocated my pump, after replacement, into the trunk. Viola! Never another problem. In spite of this, this car is unmatched in fun, performance, handling, and coolness. I am going to buy another one so I can have 2! I want a 2.5 for comparison. These cars are that good! Just test drive one. You will be a believer and find a way to get one. Mark my words. Enjoy, and be safe."
car_2374,Car Love,I've had my Z4 for 5 years after owning a Z3 for 12 years. Ultimate driving machine is a great name for these cars.
car_2375,BMW Z4,BMW Z4
car_2376,Beautilful to look at but...,"This car is beautiful!! Very sexy and sleek. Just looking at it, it drips of performance and wants to go fast. That's the only positive things I have to say about it and why I have kept it but am considering moving on. The car seems to have one malfunction after another with no end in sight. To list a few of the more recent issues that needed to be fixed: Convertible top motor, all abs sensors, new starter and new coolent reservoir. Add the regular maintenance cost such as breaks, tires and other miscellaneous things that just need to replaced and be ready to fork out some serious $$$! This is my second German car and all Ihave to say is, ""So much for German engineering!"""
car_2377,What more do you want!,"just simply a Fun, fast, unique car! i just bought a white 04 z4 with red leather and couldn't be happier! drove a TT for years, loved it, but like the z4 much better because of comfort and exterior design. interior isn't as fancy as i would like, but who needs a GPS when your having fun getting lost driving around! very low to ground, makes for a little awkward ""in and out"" ... but who cares! gets tons of compliments, looks amazing from all sides. you don't see these cars all over the place which makes them even more unique. great around corners, i live in pacific northwest, and wet windy roads are super fun! ... nice and quiet with top up!"
car_2378,A great car even after 6 Years,"So I bought a 2004 Z4 with 17K miles on it a moth ago. Drove it from Pittsburgh to Chicago to get it home and it was a blast! Wow! This car is comfy, roomy, powerful, reliable, and fun! The 2.5 has quite the power and I can't really notice a difference vs. the 3.0. What more can you ask for? The prices are very competitive these days for a pre-owned. I test drove a Z3 10 years ago and hated it so I bought a MR2 Spyder. This vehicle tops them both by far. Fairly quiet with the top up, especially for a convertible. and you can't really feel the wind too bad when its down."
car_2379,Very Impressive Indeed!,"Just bought a 2004 Z4 with 17K miles and this vehicle drives very impressively. I drove the vehicle home 600 miles and it was very comfortable, handled nicely, and was just a blast to drive. This is my first BMW. In the past I've owned a 2000 MR2 Spyder and this Z4 tops it by far. Great trunk space, powerful motor, roomy interior. I really think I can drive this vehicle everyday if I wanted to."
car_2380,Z4 Review,"This car is excellent in every way.  I've had other roadsters, but this one is the best without exception. I think it will survive to become a valued collector car in a few years."
car_2381,What a snow ride,"I had this 2004 Z4 3.0 for the last 4 years. Silver titanium. It is impressive, I love it very much. Drove it all year around in Detroit and Minneapolis. This car is great on snow with the right tires. It is fun to drive. I test drove the SL55 AMG as my next car possibly. Let me tell you, I have  to think twice now. Z4 is even more than what we may think. It has been difficult to choose something else after you drive this car. Most likely it will be SL55 AMG though for me tough decision to move from the Z4 even after more than 4 years driving it all year around. Never drove a car for that long. Go get one don't even think twice about Z4. :)"
car_2382,Fun and practicality in one package,"I bought this car as a CPO with 13,000 miles on it.  I have not been disappointed at all.  Living in Southern California, this car does it all for me, from running to the grocery store to taking it for a run in the mountains.  This is not a weekend toy for me; I use it regularly.  I drove this car cross-country and was pleasantly surprised by comfort level it gave me on a 6000 mile trip.  Its performance is excellent; it sticks to a mountain road like glue even on wet/icy pavement.  I have every option but the nav system; the power driver's seat definitely ups the comfort level.  I definitely recommend the 6 speed manual; it's a pain sometimes in LA traffic, but worth it overall."
car_2383,Great Weekend Toy,"Great toy for the weekends. Never even a warranty item. Corners great. I have the SMG package which takes getting use to. Boxster S killer and Porsche owners always hate to loose!  Drawbacks, cup holders are useless but necessary to have drinks in the Florida heat. This is a sports car and a bumpy sports car ride with stiff seats.  Anything past a couple hours it hard on the butt."
car_2384,As good as it gets,"What a fantasic roadster, much better than the Z3, test drove the TT and Boxster. It's simply better than anything in its class."
car_2385,"Fun, fun, fun - but a bit impractical","Let's face it. People buy cars like this for their fun factor, and perhaps for their ""cool"" factor as well. The Z4 does a bang-up job of providing both while delivering upwards of 25 mpg. It's a bit of a chore getting in and out, especially for a 6'2"" guy like me, but once you're inside it's surprisingly roomy if you lower the seats all the way. The power convertible top works perfectly, and the interior is gorgeous. The ride is stiff, but the car runs and handles fantastically.  My only complaint: you have to be careful when parking or you'll scrape the underside of the front cowling."
car_2386,Z is good for me,I got this car when I finally could afford one and wow it did not disappoint.  I got the SMG based transmission and that thing is a total blast.  I love the car so much that I am leasing a new 07 Z4 3.0si starting in 2 days!  My only gripe is that the Z series is always behind in cool technology that the 3 series has.  No siruis radio. Pathetic.  It's a very small gripe on a kickin' car!
car_2387,Land Shark,"This thing is sleek, corners well, good turning radius, punchy 0-60 for the amount of money spent, the stereo system is decent for a stock set-up.  A little awkward getting out of the vehicle but this is nothing new for a sporty vehicle / roadster.  All in all it's a great car!"
car_2388,Great Summer fun,"Really have enjoyed the Z4. Lightweight but feels rock solid on the road.  Outstanding handling, steering feedback.  Acceleration is very good, though of course I always want more.  Very firm ride, can border on jarring on bad roads, but much better than M3 convertible.  Actually very comfortable for distances on reasonable smooth roads.  Only significant complaint pertains to most of BMW lineup: runflat tires.  They are more firm, don't help performance, are stocked by very few local shops, and are VERY expensive.  Cheapest local quote: >$1,000 for 2 tires w/ installation.  Ordered from Tirerack.com but even then was >$700 w/ installation.  Not great given many folks had treadlife issues."
car_2389,Gettin' the looks...,"Ok, really... this car gets more looks than YouTube.  Every place I go/park, someone comments on it. And, it's all positive, and I couldn't agree more!  This is one fun car to drive/have. Come on, face it... it's not a practical car but who cares!  If you want practical, buy a sedan.  This car reeks of attitude, confidence and carefree fun! Buy it, drive it, baby it, love it... it is well worth it!"
car_2390,Great Fun for The Money,"This car is great. It is the most fun someone can have driving. Pop the car into sport mode and you're gone. The car moves with a single touch, there is no lag what so ever. The only negatives are its small size (but you already know that) though a spacious trunk for the size of car, and the car isn't the most comfortable thing for trips longer than 2 hours. I would highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun car. It is not the best family car but strap in and hit some open road and try not to smile. You can't help but love it."
car_2391,My Z4!,I have enjoyed everything about this car.   The top goes down in 7 seconds and the two 12-inch subwoofers make music to my ears. Handling and overall features are superb.
car_2392,The ultimate driving machine,"The Z4 drives and handles as excellent as it looks.  The controls and cockpit are well appointed, roomy, comfortable, and everything at your finger tips. The cargo area will hold a 22"" travel bag with room for two small duffles or two small golf bags.  All in all the Z4 is the Ultimate Driving Machine."
car_2393,Just what I was looking for!,"Hi, I am full time mom, have a ""minivan"" because I have 3 kids + few friends to lug around. But buying Z4 was exactly what I was looking for. It is reliable, handles beautifully and looks very hot. Gas mileage is excellent and I can take one of the kids at a time to have a good conversation going... weekends to enjoy with my husband. He has porsche for his weekend car but somehow we always end up driving mine (wonder why? :-)). The size of the trunk is perfect for one good food store shopping or to fit all my stuff for cool weekend. As I said,""It's all I was looking for!"""
car_2394,Z4,"Excellent handling very responsive. Classic design. Trunk will fit two soft bag golf clubs. Love the power top.   Seat adjustment is superb over my ex '99 corvette. I am able to stand when exiting the car rather than rolling out of it with the corvette.  Very quiet ride with the top up and with the windscreen in place with the top down.  Quality craftsmanship both in the exterior and interior desgn.  After all, it is the ultimate driving machine."
car_2395,Z4 in VA,"Car is a kick in the pants every day.  Once you get in, the fun starts.  I have a 6 sp and it is butter smooth with a light clutch.  The car is what a sports car should be all about."
car_2396,Blast,"This little car is a real blast to dirve. I have owned 535s, a new M3, MGB, 442 and numerous fun cars, but none as much fun as this little ragtop. It gives you total feel of the road, which when bumpy perhaps too much. But once again it's a sweet ride. My Z is black with a tan top and while some are critical of the styling, I get lots of ""I was admiring your car"" and such. The 6 speed is smooth as silk and the 3.0 delivers pleanty of power. I can't wait to test drive the new M series. I can't recommend this car enough to anyone looking for a roadster.And your BMW dealer probably has a demo for you to check out before ordering. Thats what happened to me as a four test drive convinced me."
car_2397,Z - one for me!!!,"After owning MGs, Eclipses, and Triumphs, I finally found the one true sports car that ""fits"".  It is reliable, handles like a dream and is truly beautiful to view.  I get excellent gas mileage and have the pickup and speed to feel confident, even in the worst traffic.  The 3 cubic feet of trunk is enough for my wife and myself to go on weekend trips and she can take ALL her stuff!!!  All in all it absolutely meets my needs."
car_2398,BMW=Best Made in the World!,"I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this car.  This is the first manual transmission I have ever even tried to drive and after owning this BMW Z4 I will never drive an automatic ever again.  Besides the fact that it has superior craftsmanship, great styling, and is a blast to drive I get great gas mileage that really helps with the rise of prices at the pump.  My next car will definitely be a BMW!"
car_2399,Jim's Z4,"I really love driving this car, it handles like a dream in the sport mode.  I really like to shift it with the steptronic transmission, it shifts very smooth. I also like the easy to read gauges at night, the orange dash lights are just cool.  I have all the options and packages you can get with this car except for the navigation. I also want Sirius radio which I can get but the trunk mounted antenna just don't work for me.  It's a little hard getting in and out of because it is low to the ground but onced you're in and settled you can for hours with the top down and the windscreen in place."
car_2400,Fun to Drive,It's a great car. The tops comes down in only 8 sec. Very fast. Good gas mileage. Fun to drive.
car_2401,1st BMW...not last for sure.,"Originally got this for my wife.  I'm stealing it from her and getting her a 5 series.  I still don't understand why the styling is ""controversial""...I get more approving stares and chatter about this car than I ever thought possible.  We have the 3.0 with the Sport Pkg. Ride is firm for sure, but it's such a go-kart when it comes to the twisties...love it.  Gets great mileage for something that's so fast."
car_2402,my review,"This is my first roadster ever and I love it! Most verts Ive driven have lots of body shake and feel like they are falling apart. This car is TIGHT! No shakes over the roughest of roads. The performance is top notch. The handling is incredible. I try my hardest to get the rearend to fishtail in safe settings....cant do it! The interior is very teutonic, very German, very luxurious....top notch."
car_2403,Awesome Performance !,"Great performance - braking, corners, pickup.  Comfortable but stiff ride - but expected in a roadster.  Actually gets better gas mileage than expected."
car_2404,Landshark; Rules the road,"This is truly the Ultimate Driving Machine. I have an SMG transmission which allows you to shift manually with automatic clutching. I have the control of the manual with no clutching hassles! With the Sports mode on, the car gives an amazing feel. The engine sound and in the gut acceleration really gets the juices flowing. The steering is responsive and the suspension tight; this is not a touring sedan. I test drove the Z3 before buying this, and this car feels and drive very differently. It is a lot more powerful and ""manly"". When I look at it from the front it reminds of a shark & the Z4 rules the road like one. BMW leases are not expensive; get a Z4. Money well spent."
car_2405,Awesome car,"I fell in love with this car at the dealer. It was love at first sight. I went to look at the practical 330xi. I had a 5 series for my last 2 cars and thought I wanted the sporty 3 series with all wheel drive for the mountains of NC. I saw the Z4 and had visions of a jet fighter. It just looks so awesome to me. Well the test drive was even more impresive, I had to have one. The car is so great that we drove it to key west on our vacation rather than flying. It was so cool."
car_2406,The best car ever,"It is quite cheap to run, extreme performance, comfortable seats, heaps of room, bottom line it is the best car ever (that I've driven)."
car_2407,My Z4,It is a great car indeed but some improvements have to be done!
car_2408,Best Sports Conv. for the money,"This is a fantastic little rocket!  It 
goes fast and stops quickly.  The 
steering takes practice -  
Occasionally when driving over uneven 
road surfaces the car will pull left 
or right.  So, it's best to keep a 
tight grip on this ""race ready"" cat.  
That will keep it from going astray."
car_2409,The Firmament Smiled,"head turner and heart melter upon sight one becomes a Moses parting freeway obstacles magically as heaven itself appears to join one's motoring revelry commanding everyone around to give way, make room, here comes the fair haired, favored roadster that takes the breath of saints and angels all."
car_2410,Z4 4 Fun,"I think the z4 is a great little car for the weekend. Fun, fast and gets great looks from others -- but does not break your bank account doing it."
car_2411,"Great at first, then....","I bought the Z4 as what seemed like a natural 
upgrade from my Z3. I paid a premium to own this 
car, based on it's stellar styling and improvements, 
such as the fully auto top and glass rear window. 
However after owning it for the first 6 months, it 
began to annoy me to no end. It's horribly 
uncomfortable.  From the unsupportive seats, the 
exaggerated door interior door handles that chafe 
my left leg every time I shift, to the un-adjustable 
seat belt that chokes me every time I drive.  Plus 
the 1/4' inch clearance from the dash to 
my right knee, and I'm only 6'1!  Add an ultra-harsh 
ride, and I feel like I'm in a torture chamber each 
time I get in. I wish I had kept the z3."
car_2412,LOVEMYZZZ4,"Have had the car 6 mobnths and love it 
more every time i drive it.  Heads 
turn and I continually get tons of 
compliments.  Currently, I avaerage 24 
MPG, not bad for a sports car! The 
dealership has been very accomodating 
for appointments and any repairs.  I 
took the car on a 600 mile trip and was 
able to pack the trunk with 3 duffle 
bags, and a lot of other things.  I was 
amazed how much the trunk held.  I 
highly reccommend this car!  It's 
wonderful!"
car_2413,Should have kept the Z3,"I love the look of the car but it 
didn't drive as well as the Z3 and not 
as roomy as my Audi TT.  Z4 has a lot 
of power and fun to drive, but wish I 
had my Z3 back."
car_2414,Z4 was the worst car i have ever owned.,"I bought my car brand new with 6 miles 
on it.  Ive had it a year and has 
11,000 miles on it now.  I had to bring 
it to the show 8 times.  The instrument 
cluster needed replacing twice. The 
passenger side power seat went out. The 
gas cap lid cover fell off at the gas 
station. The passenger side window fell 
out.  The dealer would not take it 
back. BMW America would not do 
anything, but they ""made a note of it"" 
In 2003, the domestic cars had less 
complaints then the european cars.  
Makes you wonder why.  I should have 
bought a cadallac."

handling and the performane are 
fantastic! my car is automatic

when the sport buttom is on! or when u 
drive it with the toptronic .. i think 
that this car beat all the cars in its

car options! it turns alot of heads !"
car_2416,Fun to drive,"Met or exceeded all my expectations as 
a roadster"
car_2417,A great choice,"I've had my Z4 for about a month now. 
Got all the options - Performance & 
Sport packages, Steptronic, heated 
seats.  A little pricy, but lots of 
fun.  The car drives extremely well and 
will behave as reserved as you want it 
to when in normal mode, but transforms 
into a real tiger when you push the 
Sports button or shift the Steptronic 
into sports drive.  There is no 
comparison to the 2.5, which felt 
underpowered.  It is a little bumpy 
with the 18"" wheels, but not as bad as 
I had feared.  Watch out for pot 
holes!  It does not handle puddles very 
well (easily hydroplanes).  It is a 
real eye-turner for young and old 
alike."
car_2418,Great Z4,"Great fun car.  Automatic roof is 
great.  Smooth acceleration, nice 
cruising (though the engine revs a 
little fast on the highway).  I have 
driven it over 500 miles in a day and 
was comfortable (6'1"", 230).  I took a 
db meter on my test drive, and with 
the top up it was just a few db higher 
than my Acura RL."
car_2419,love it,"My friend let me drive it round he 
block and i instantly fell in love with 
it. its handling its looks its comfort 
its one of those cars that people just 
go wow about. when i get the money im 
buying one for sure"
car_2420,fun,"This is a car that will give the driver 
everything he/she hopes for; style, 
reliability, confort and security"
car_2421,Still awesome one year later,"Absolutely the coolest car to drive.  
I love the styling and handling, the 
power and the smooth ride (for the 
size).  I've thrown friends that are 
6'3"" and 250 lbs in this to drive it 
and they fit!  It truely holds two 
sets of golf clubs (standard carry 
bags). Sports package and the 3.0 were 
perfect upgrades.  The big suprise was 
the gas mileage, about 26 MPG.  My 04' 
Durango gets about half what this 
does. The only bad thing about driving 
this vehicle is that you can't see it 
from the outside when you're behind 
the wheel."
car_2422,LOVE THOSE ROADSTERS,NOTHING BUT GREAT FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
car_2423,Zzzzzzzzzzz Way 2 Go,"This is a eye catcher, 1st BMW and it 
was love at 1st sight. Very satisified.
Daily comments from others. Feel like 
I'm driving a shark. General Motors 
take note, It's a Beamer not a Vet."
car_2424,MY 1st Convertablie --ohhh what FUN!!!,"man i got a great deal on this baby 
and i love every moment of it!!  
people stop me everywhere i go and ask 
me about it.  for the price of this 
ultimate driving machine...you cant go 
wrong.  you can get a better deal now 
that they are making rooms for the 
2005 models.  like some one posted 
earlier..this is not a race car, but a 
FUN CAR TO RIDE!"
car_2425,I wish I could drive it year round but,"I live in Philly so in the garage it 
stays for the winter. If I can't put 
the top down I'm not drivin it. There 
is nothing like putting the top down 
on a cool crisp night and watching the 
stars roll by as you criuse down the 
highway.You may not be sold on it's 
looks but spend some quality time 
behind the wheel of this puppy and you 
might just change your tune.It handles 
like a dream and trust me there's more 
then enough power to get you into 
trouble.If you are in the market for a 
car do yourself a favor and at least 
take a Z4 for a test drive. You won't 
regret it!"
car_2426,Fun 2 Drv,"Locked on cruise control at 125 MPH for
400 miles (Omaha, NE to Fargo, ND). 
Stopped once for gas and slowed down
three times for cops, but made the trip

how many Z4's were manufactured
worldwide for 2003, but I suspect that
people will collect these cars 20 years
from now."
car_2427,terrific car!,"Although many must disagree, I love the 
look and handling of this car.  It's 
got plenty of power, as opposed to the 
jaguar and mercedes convertibles i 
previously owned.  The new lines make 
it unique.  The lack of the idrive 
makes it the only BMW I have any 
interest in driving, since I am not a 
nuclear engineer or software designer, 
which I assume is a requirement to be 
able to understand the idrive."
car_2428,enjoying my Z4  x 10,"This is a FUN FUN FUN car to drive. The 
3.0 engine with the SMG transmission is 
even more FUN. I truely am enjoying 
this car and appreciate all the 
complements on its good looks. I chose 
the metalic black with red seats and 
electric top. The Z4 looks fast even 
standing still. I'm 6'2"" and fit very 
comfortably. The sound system is 
excellent as is the exhaust system. 
There is a lot I like about this car 
and spend a lot of quality time in it.

drive, for what it is and who the 
average buyer might be,girly type, it's 
the nuts..I think if I could convince 
her I would add a Blower, or turbo, 
then we could have a real blast.All in 
all, the handleing is good, a little

all around fun!"
car_2433,Z4 SMG,"Great Drive, especially with the SMG 
trans. Once you get use to the SMG, you 
wouldn't want a an auto.,less a 6spd.

everything anyone can want.  Great 
looks, sporty, true roadster feel.  
Top is down in a NY minute and back up 
as quick when necessary.  The power

previously owned Z3 in handling room 
and power."
car_2438,JAB,"The Z3 never interested me, but the 
looks and styling of the Z4 really 
caught my interest.  The handling and 
performance is terrific and you have 
the reputation and retention value that 
only BMW can provide.  Throw in the 
free service and maintenance during the 
warranty period and I am a happy, first-
time owner of a BMW, albeit with 
classic mid-life crisis symptoms."

superb auto, and you can corner with 
abandon-  unlike the Porsche..."

Day this year.  I had been looking at 
this car for months, and I have not 
been disappointed in the least!  I love 
it!  It is a really cool ride.  It is 
fun, fast, and makes me feel 20 years 
younger just being in it.  Strangers, 
young and old alike, comment to me 
about it all the time. It is smooth and 
sleek.  It is very convenient the way 
the top folds down on its own.  I 
couldn't ask for a better car!"
car_2443,LOOKS and PERFORMANCE,"This is the car you drive when you 
leave the kids at home. It looks great, 
drives superbly and it even makes 
you 'look' sexier regardless of your

best"
car_2448,Z4 ownership review,"Love everything about the vehicle.  
Styling is great along with comfort.  It 
is a pure joy to drive.  The BMW 
dealership that I bought my Z4 from 
was absolutely fantastic.  They did 
everything possible to make this 
purchase enjoyable.  Once you drive 
this car everything else just doesn't 
measure up.  The best part about 
driving this car is to drive it in the 
mountains or along the coastal 
highways."
car_2449,Love It !!,I just love it..
car_2450,wonderful,"This car (black exterior, tan interior, manual, 
heated seats, convenience, premium) is 
fantastic. I love the looks of it as does everyone 
who sees it (I have never seen group of men gather 
around a Boxter), it regularly attracts crowds. The 
interior is simple and functional, at 6 foot 2 inches I 
have plenty of room inside. The engine sound is 
deep and throaty, it actually gets 
deliberately transmitted into the seating area. The 
turning circle is amazingly tight. Steering can be a 
little jittery on an uneven road surface, but 
otherwise the car just grips the road around 
corners. Useable trunk for a small car. Feels smooth 
at 114 mph, I'm to scared to go faster!"
car_2451,My Z4,"This vehicle is truely the ULTIMATE 
DRIVING MACHINE. The craftsmanship is 
superb and the style is one of a kind.  
Really a joy to drive.  I love German

fantastic."
car_2454,Z4 a blast to drive,"Loads of fun to drive and is a real 
head turner. Has great body styling and 
excellent response while driving."
car_2455,X,"The car is all it is advertised to be.  
It handles better than I am willing to 
drive it.  Speed and acceleration is 
great.  Like the Z4 style more than the 
Z3."
car_2456,"Havin fun, now.","Love this car.  The bright red paint 
and sculpted lines get lots of looks!  
Handles great, build quality is 
impressive, rock solid.  Ride is a bit 
on the firm side but not punishing.  
Fully automated top is a breeze to use.
Tenacious grip is a blast."
car_2457,2004 Z4.  It is Zelightful!,"3.0 Great car for the money.  Head 
turner wherever I go.
The Olivin Green color is stunning.  I 
have a light leather interior and Beige 
top.  Ironically, that combination is 
not an option on the BMW web sight. 
Pleasure to drive, great handling.  
Love the heated seats,power top,6 speed 
& 10 speaker stereo. Cup holders are 
weak-lousy design. Soda cans/cups-
condensation drips into elect. window 
siwtch-not good. Could use a few more 
ponies 250-275 bhp would be better. 
Overall very satisified, and would 
highly recommend."

stylish, eye-catching."
car_2459,The Car Turns Heads,"Have 2,500 miles on my Z4 and it is a 
continual joy to drive. It constantly 
turns heads. Handles well & 2.5l engine 
has plenty of power & runs like a fine 
watch. Would buy it again in a 
heartbeat."
car_2460,Great Car!,"I recently bought a 2004 Z4, having 
previously owned a 2001 Z3. The Z4 is 
a great improvement and is truly a 
luxury roadster.  The automatic top is 
a breeze to put up and down with it's 
one button operation.  The climate 
control is like what I am used to on a 
luxury auto.  And the trunk has almost 
twice the room that I had with my 
Z3.   The interior also seems to be 
roomier.  It's also nice to have a 
remote door/trunk opener which I did 
not have on my Z3.  While some of the 
industry analysts have been critical 
of the exterior design, most people I 
know use the words ""awesome"" or ""cool"" 
to describe the Z4 whereas the 
word ""cute"" seemed to go along with 
the"
car_2461,woodys,"I think this vehicle is a fresh new 
look into B M Ws future,other such 
vehicles with such ammenties are far 
more expensive and little on design ie
(mazda,miata).I have found it is a 
really comfortable car plus really 
peppy on take offs and passing gears.I 
would suggest this car to any one 
looking for a fine quality convertable 
that doesnt want to spend 40k.This 
vehicle offers plenty of ammenties plus 
lots of fresh new look."
car_2462,Superb auto,"Without the most smooth running vehicle 
I have ever owned.  The service and 
attention to my personal needs was 
excellent and continues to be."
car_2463,Automatic Fun,"With the sportsmatic automatic shifter 
the car is fun to drive without the 
hassles of a stick in stop/go traffic.  
Car has great handling on turns."
car_2464,Awesome!,"I owned a Z3 for 3 yrs then trade in 
for the Z4 in Oct 2002, and I'm totally 
in love with this Car! even though I 
would love it to have more performance, 
(maybe if it were a 3.0 would help, but 
I got the first Z4 out of the dealer 
and only 2.5 was available at that 
time), A lot more confortable than Z3, 
love the reliability, the design, the 
futuristic features like rain sensor, 
automatic lights, etc, that for sure 
make my life a lot easier, It is 
definitaly a better version,Handling is 
sharper  and IT'S A LOT OF FUN !!!! 
(not counting all the looks you get 
while in it! :)"
car_2465,simply awsome,"had the car for 4 months now and I 
still love driving it like I had it 
the first day.  It is quick off the 
line, and glues to the pavement around 
corners.  I've looked into the Porche 
BoxterS and Mercedes SLK320 and I 
think this is the best buy of the 
bunch.  The 18 inch wheel and stiff 
suspension may make the ride a bit 
rough, but it is a small compromise 
given the overall quality."
car_2466,Awesome Car,"This is an awesome car.  The Z4 3.0 is 
fast and fun to drive.  It gets great 
gas mileage, I average 28 mpg.  My Z4 
is has the sport feature which really 
makes it get up and go.  The GPS is 
terrific and easy to use.  Heated seats 
are a nice feature, making driving at 
night with the top down comfortable and 
cozy.  There is ample leg room.  When 
driving and parking it is important to 
remember that the front is low to the 
ground and most of the car is in front 
of you.  The front will hit the 
concrete parking stops and curbs if you 
are not careful. Overall, the Z4 3.0 is 
a blast to drive."
car_2467,Review of my 3.0 BMW Z4 2004,"This is by far the best vehicle I have 
ever owned. Its just what I always 
wanted. I liked the Z3 but the Z4 is 
much better in every catagory. I will 
now own a BMW the rest of my life. They 
are a dream and drive like a dream. The 
service is awesome and I have had 
nothing but good luck. Sincerely, Jim"
car_2468,amazing!!,"Ive been unbelievable impressed with 
this car since the day i baught it. It 
drives amazing in the rain and most 
likely will do the same in the snow.  
This car gets so many looks and its the 
most comfortable car ive ever owned ."
car_2469,"A good, fun drive","Love it!  Small defects, tho:  open 
glove compartment, everything falls 
out.  Open storage bin between seats, 
it's so high up you can hardly get to 
anything. Side door compartments are 
difficult to reach into. But there's 
more trunk space now, than the Z3.  
Glass window in the back instead of 
plastic.  Neat-looking with topdown.  
Still a blast to drive.
Love it!"
car_2470,JPDZ4 2.5,"The Z4 is my first BMW and it the best 
driving experience I have ever had. The 
looks grow on you and the uniqueness 
and rarity of the car draws a lot of 
attention. I had first intended to buy 
a Porsche Boxster but the current style 
is boring and they are very common in 
my neighborhood."
car_2471,Over Z Top,"In the few short months I have owned 
this Z4, I am convinced this is the 
ultimate roadster.  Fun to drive, great 
engineering."
car_2472,Initial impressions,"This is my first roadster and I love 
it.  Handling and performance are 
great.  The interior is comfortable and 
pleasantly styled.  The cons cannot 
subtract from the enjoyment factor. I 
recommend the premium, convenience, and 
sport packages."
car_2473,very responsive  cool car,"Its a sport car yet it feels like a 
full size car to drive. It's roomy. 
doesn't feel closed in. Hugs the road 
beautifully. The sound system is great.
Its great to drive at night. For a 
sport car it can light the whole street 
and beyond  as you drive by and you 
won't feel alone or scared on a lonely 
road."
car_2474,WOW!,"Great car!  I have never driven a car 
that sticks to the road like this 
one!  Very quick and agile!  Also, BMW 
obviously understands that speed is 
not all that matters!  I love that 
sport button!  This car will make you 
want to take the longest, twistiest, 
open road home!  When I drive by, 
people's head swivel!  Classy car!  A 
great driving machine!"

highway."
car_2478,Pity Poor External Design,"Fantastic car to drive lots of fun. 
Good road holding and comfortable. Z3 
styling was much much better."
car_2479,WOW,"I drove this car to New Orleans right 
after I bought it.  This car stopped 
traffic on Bourbob Street.  People were 
gawking and taking pictures.  When we 
pulled up to the hotel, people walked 
across the street to ask about the 
car.  People coming out of the hotel 
stopped to ask about the car and look 
at it.  I thought the doorman would 
never have a chance to unload our car. 
This car still causes a stir wherever I 
go!   WOW!!"
car_2480,"good drive, plenty of fun","the 2.5 model is fast enough to get the 
driver in trouble but the brakes are 
excellent; the styling sets this car 
apart.  my problem is with the run flat 
tires which seem prone to go flat and 
are expensive; in 12000 miles i've had 
three flats; no one is sure about a 
cause"
car_2481,The fun zone starts here,"Exellent car for the money, beats 
Porsche Boxster and Audi TT without 
question,love the aggresive design, 
some hate, it I love it, most non BMW 
owners thinks is an $80,000 car, worth 
the extra money I paid for the 3.0."
car_2482,If you knew Suzy...,"This is my first convertible bought 
almost by accident. My mother Sue had 
one, thus the name. It is red and it is 
sweet. Just ask anyone passing by as I 
drive though. It's the only one in town!
It handles quickly and smoothly, 
responding well on any kind of road in 
any kind of weather.I feel safe in it, 
enev though it is a convertible.
It's size suits me- I rarely need to 
carry anyone.I don't worry about cargo 
space- it carries enough groceries 
home. 
With the top down I can put on a hat 
and drive the turnpike without effort. 
The sound system increases enough so 
that the wind is not a problem.
I'd reccomend this car to any one who 
wants one and can afford it!"
car_2483,Z4 - no comparison (even to the Z3),"I owned the Z3 for 3 years and upgraded 
to the Z4 about a year ago. WOW says it 
all. BMW should pat themselves on the 
back for this one. The improvements on 
the interior from the Z3 to the Z4 are 
incredible and numerous. The exterior 
is the most obvious change, and that 
did take a little bit to grow on me - 
but I love it now. The handling, 
acceleration, braking, and response of 
the vehicle are fantastic - the sport 
button definetly gives it that 
extra ""kick"" when you need it. If you 
never owned a BMW or a roadster, I 
guarantee you will love it. If you are 
upgrading from the Z3, you will thank 
God you did. You will be amazed by all 
of the compliments you get."
car_2484,"Great car, if you like to  drive","The best two-seater I have ever 
owned. Great acceleration, great grip, 
cornering is a pleasure, it is very 
safe and the drive is always 
controlled, the steering is 
unbelievable, it is very comfortable 
and it looks great. What else do you 
need from a sports car?
On the downside, I have had several 
warranty issues, there were material 
flaws and the repair crews were not 
always familar with the car and with 
their own job (e.g. destroying things 
as they fixed others).
Last, my 2 cents: get the SMG (semi-
manual gearbox) if you can. It is the 
best shifting experience I have ever 
had and far superior to the other 
alternative of manual shifting."
car_2485,Can get you in trouble really quickly...,"I used to own a Z3 2.5 - The 
differences between the two are night & 
day. Where the Z3 had a tendency to 
oversteer easily, this car just sticks. 
To explore the handling limits, you 
would have to drive it at a race track. 

Some people may not like the ride, 
however. (It can get a bit punishing at 
times, especially with the 18"" wheels).

Acceleration is very fast, you don't 
realize how much faster the 3.0 is 
until you drive one. 

The styling is a little strange at 
first, but it really does grow on you. 
Not only that, but I think the styling 
makes it stand out more.

As for reliability, I haven't had a 
single problem."
car_2486,Big Pimpin',"This car is great fun and garners 
random compliments from strangers all 
the time.  It's supposed to compete 
with the Boxster but the Z4 is way 
classier and better looking."
car_2487,The ultimate driving machine,"For a company to use ""The Ultimate 
Driving Machine"", they need to make the 
best car, and BMW does!  This is my 
first, and I can't see myself driving 
anything else in the future.  This Z4 
makes even driving in LA traffic fun!"
car_2488,Z-4 Best Sports Car,"This is a great car that makes driving 
fun.   It performs like a finely tuned 
machine.   This is my first BMW but 
will not be my last."
car_2489,Z4 2.5,"I love this car.  Unbelievable value.  
Corners phenominally well.  Very quick 
(3.0 is quicker but ?worth extra 
$7000).  Great styling.  The top is up 
and down, not latching, in 8-9 
seconds.  The top is also lined so the 
ride is quiet and feels like you're in 
a hard top when inside.  An absolute 
pleasure to drive."
car_2490,One great car,"a lot more than one would expect with 
over-engineered everything...with a few 
add-ons, this baby will crank nearly 
230 hp, runs around 6 in the qtr and 
tops 150+. Stylish, not cheap to 
operate (93 oct)but roads very nice....."

makes me smile, even if it's raining!"
car_2492,MY Z4,"I LOVE THIS CAR, SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE!"
car_2493,Grows on you,"Almost bought a Boxster but the 
spaciousness and quality of the 
interior of the BMW sold me. The 
Boxster Interior reminded of an old 
Toyota. I wasn't sure I would like the 
BMW exterior but have to say it has 
grown on me and I am happy with the 
choice. I was looking for a car I could 
drive long distances comfortably and 
the BMW fills that need and provides 
rocket ship performance and handling"
car_2494,Z4,"The Z4 is a true roadster yet offers 
comfort, convenience and luxury. Very 
quite for a convertible. Enough trunk 
space to actually ""use"" the car."
car_2495,Dreams Come True,"It is a awesome machine to drive!  I 
love the way you can feel the road and 
cornering is unbelieveable!  The power 
and acceleration is quick and 
responsive.  A pleasure to drive!"
car_2496,Great Beemr Z-4,"Had a Z-3. Nice drive. Z-4 much better. 
Smoother, handles better, but very spry 
and responsive. The 2.51 has power 
enough, very quick. The thick soft top 
when closed creates a sport coupe like 
interior rather than a rag top like 
sound.
Highly recommend this car for a fun 
peppy ride."
car_2497,Love the car,"This is the most agile and spirited car 
I have ever driven...and I've driven 
many.  That includes the Honda S2000, 
which I thought was a poor second to 
the Z-4.  I don't get the raves over 
the S2000.  The cheapest looking 
interior I had ever seen.  I'd have 
been embarased to have my friends in 
it.  The engine my a touch faster, but 
the handling didn't even compare.  I 
wonder about you editors every time you 
rate the S2000 so high.  There is MUCH 
more to a car than just the engine.  
I'm a designer...the Z-4 has style, and 
the others all look alike."

least.  Good German engineering while 
true roadster heart and handeling."
car_2499,BMW,"I have personally owned a BMW for about 
30 years.  All that I have had have 
lasted me over 200,000 miles.  They are 
an excellent car, thats starts up every 
time.  My new Z4 is as smooth as ever 
with very little that I don't enjoy 
about it."
car_2500,I love this car,"suspension is a little stiff but once 
you get it on a nice smooth and curvey 
road you forget all about it. the smg

it!"

vague handling. it's not even concider 
as a relax crusier, it's feels like a

and aged styling), S2000 (fun, but not 
a good daily driver and too noise on 
the freeway.), Miata(good handling, 
but feels too light and lack of the 
sense of safty.)Z4 3.0 (unbeatable 
performace, but also some 9K more then

car_2502,Vacation on wheels,"Cant find the time to get away from
daily stress long enough for a vaction ?
No worries.  BMW offers ""the great
escape"" in the form of the Z4. Sleek
comfort and road hugging power combine
for your driving pleasure that is sure
to make any drive a BMW devote."
car_2503,Best Car I have ever bought.,"Fun to drive.  Everyone who see the Z-4 
tells me how beautiful they think it is.
Very fast. Feels solid while driving.
Very small truck. Need more storage.
Otherwise, a truly great car. I 
recommend it for those who want to have 
fun drivi"
car_2504,you'll never know,"Unless your Z4 is headed for the 
track,you'll never know just how really 
good it is.I have yet to find the 
limits of the car's handling.I have 
owned several BMWs,they are always as 
good the day you sell them as the day 
you drive it off the lot.Think of how 
you can't wait to get rid of most cars 
after a couple years of driving,you'll 
never feel that way about your Z4"
car_2505,Fun Car top down driving,"Fun to drive, great handling, razor 
sharp precision steering.  great 
looking vehicle, there is nothing 
controversial about it.  it is a great 
looking car inside and out and spacious 
for a 6'4"" male.  Test drove Nissan 
350Z roadster, and you have to be less 
than 5'10"" to even think about buying 
one.  I am glad it worked out, and I 
got a better car in the long run."
car_2506,Fun to Drive,"I have had the most fun in the past 2 
days driving my Z4 than i have every 
had. What a fun experience. It is 
smooth riding , yet responsive. It 
handles like a dream on curves. This 
really lives up to the ""ultimate  
driving machine."""

car_2508,LUV MY Z4,"Although I only have the car for a 
short time, it is the BEST investment 
that I have made!  It is so well built 
and rides like a dream.  The heated 
seats are very comfortable and the 
power top is a breeze to put down.  I 
have never been happier with a car! I 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
car_2509,The Z,"The Z4 is fun to drive all the time. We 
have taken several long trips >1000 
miles the trunk holds 2 airline roller 
bags + addional gear. (Golf clubs fit 
fust fine also). The handling, power 
and interior space make the car a joy 
to drive."
car_2510,Z4 review,"The car is quite exciting to drive, it 
handles well and has enough horsepower 
to pass anyone in the way. It gets alot 
of attention on the road with out being 
too obnoxious. I have owned many 
convertables and this is by far the 
most exciting to drive."
car_2511,BMW,"Excellent vehicle, I recently purchased 
one as a gift for my husband, he enjoys 
it, loves the feel of the car, the 
interior, and the reliability of it."
car_2512,I LOVE it!,"This is my 2nd BMW... as they say, this 
is THE driving machine. I test drove 
several other car manufacturer's 
convertibles... NONE of them thrilled 
me... but, just driving out of the 
dealer's lot on the test drive was a 
thrill. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this car."
car_2513,You'll Love It,"The manual 6 speed with the 3.0 engine 
gives pick up at high speeds that 
leaves everyone else behind.  If you 
are boxed in with highway traffic you 
can get a clear shot from 60 to 80 and 
the traffic will disappear."
car_2514,Z4,"My Z-4 is great handling, responsive 
fun and solid.  It is a great car to 
drive.  Really get attention to."
car_2515,Z4 tires,"Overall, the Z4 is a nice car. The 
problem is tha run flat tires.  They 
have a tread wear rating of 140 which 
translates about 15,000 miles.  It will 
cost in excess of $1,000 to replace 
them. They cannot be repaired if 
punctured and they cannot be found in 
stock at any Bridgestone dealer I know 
of and they can only be replaced by a 
run flat certified dealer. The tires 
are not warrented by BMW so you are 
pretty much on your on. A tire problem 
on the road will probably result in a 
delay of several days.All of this so 
BMW could leave off the spare."
car_2516,Electrical/Computer Problems,"These cars are prone to electrical 
computer problems relasted to the 
Idrive system. If you search the 
Internet you will find hundreds of 
stories like mine.  My Z-4 has stalled 
out unexpectedly at total of six 
times.  The EML (Engine Malfunction 
Light)light came on, and I could not 
get the RPM's up for sufficient power.  
On 2 occasions this created life 
threating situations."
car_2517,Slice of Heaven,"Had a Z3, but was hesitant to buy the
new Z4. Well, I should have. The new
rear suspension makes the Z4 an entirely
different car. The ride is smooth,
tight. The new glass rear window
contributes to a very quiet ride. The
automatic top is a must, and the built
in tonneau cover is great. 5 speed is a
little slow off the line, not lots of
low end tourque, but once you hit the
open road, pure delight. Trunk space is
a massive 9 cu ft, awesome for a two
seat roadster. There is enough room for
a golf bag and luggage for those weekend
getaway's. I would highly recommend - Enjoy!"

It's awesome."
car_2520,"Love, love love it.","I've had my Z4 for 1 week and I'm 
loving every minute that I sit behind

and Navigation.  I'm very impressed so 
far.  The ride is firm but I expected 
it to be so.  This is not my daily 
driver so it's not a problem for me.  I 
considered the 350Z, TT, Boxster, SLK, 
S2000 and even the SC430.  This was by 
far, the best of all worlds.  I'm 6'2""

of power."
car_2523,Garage Furniture,"Its so pretty I hate to take it out of 
the garage and get it dirty.  But, on 
sunny days I take it out and travel the 
west coast of Florida.  This car turns

Any time I see another Z4 on the road 
they always smile and wave.  All us Z4 
owners know we are in a cool car."

car is the engine. Great torque at any speed. 
Effortlessly accelerates from any speed.  I have 
the sport package and the ride is mildy bumpy 
due to the 18"" tires but the aesthics are 
awesome."
car_2526,"Love, love love it.","I replaced my motorcycles with this 
2004 Z4 and am loving it more with 
every minute I  drive it.  Before I 
purchased this I looked at the 350Z,

preferred the Z4 as an overall package.

Got a Jet Black/Black Interior loaded 
with NAV, Sport/Conv/Prem/Heated

car_2528,My favorite BMW yet,"Pick up my Z4 3.0 last weekend, all I 
been doing is driving ..driving ..and 
driving.. the car is amazing, handling 
is superb.. much more solid than my 
330i.  The only complain I have is the 
trademark BMW ""THUMP"" when you close 
the door is gone and the door handle 
feels cheap like a honda or something.. 
and the mousetrap sunvisors are not too 
good when I pay over $45k for the 
vehicle.  But the performance, handling 
and all the ATTENTION you get with the 
car is well worth every penny... The 
more I drive it the more I loved it..."
car_2529,Candygram,"My Z4 (3.0i) brings smiles to my face 
with each drive.  With the exception of 
a harsh ride (hey its a sports car), it 
is very comfortable to just cruise 
around in with the top 
down.  But it really shines when you 
get into the curves.  This thing sticks 
to the road like nothing I've driven 
before, with the exception of the C5 
Vette.  Good steering feel, great 
handling, more than enough power, and 
pleny of torque at lower RPMs make this 
one helluva sports car.  And while the 
styling hasn't exactally been lauded by 
the critics, I absolutely love it;  the 
way the sun plays off its many creases 
gives it a new look each time you see 
it."
car_2530,Wow!!!,"I have no doubt that this is the best 
car I have ever been in. Overall, the 
performance and body style just blew me 
away."
car_2531,I'm obsessed with this car!!!  Soo fun,"This car is extremely fun to drive! 
with good looks to match. I have a hard 
top too and I love it.  I love the Z4. 
The performance and handling is wayyy 
above average!"
car_2532,It doesn't get any better,"I test drove several of the 
convertables in this class and the Z4 
not only looked the best but felt the 
most roomie inside while keeping it 
tight on the outside.  The handling is 
top notch."
car_2533,THE ZESTY Z4,"The Z4 3.0 really gives an amazing 
experience. It has an amazing 
combination of the BMW high standard 
luxury and the powerful 268 horsepower 
engine."
car_2534,z for life,"The Z4 is a beautifully designed 2 
seater with plenty of power for the 
average driver. The top is very easy to 
use unlike my last conv. ( 95 Corvette).
A place to keep the coffee cup is all 
its missing."
car_2535,Super Fun Car,"I've been extreamly happy with my 
purchase and would do it again in a 
heartbeat.  The car is too much fun to 
drive.  If you're seriously 
considering buying one, be warned of a 
few things:  it has a stiff 
suspension, it only fits two people 
and a moderate amount of lugage, and 
some people hate the looks.  If you 
say ""that's the way its supposed to 
be"", then you know this car is for 
you.  If these things irritate you, 
consider another car.  If you think 
the HP numbers are too low, give it a 
good test drive.  0-60 in 7, top speed 
140 is pretty good for 184 ponies.  Be 
warned: the car is addictive."
car_2536,sexy as hell,"this car is fast, fun and sexy as 
hell.  i don't know what people are 
talking about when they compare it to 
the z3, this car is a lot better.  i 
owned a z3 previously and it does not 
compare in any aspect."
car_2537,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This is simply a fun car to drive.  It 
has a true roadster feel and gets up 
and goes when told to do so.  When the 
sport button is pushed you can feel the 
suspension tighten up and the engine 
kick down a gear, it really feels great."
car_2538,Love it.,"I bought this thing to make my daily 35 
mile (each way) commute to work more 
tolerable and I have to say it sure is 
incentive to get out of bed in the 
morning. The acceleration will throw 
you back in your seat and is very 
consistent all the way up as far as I 
have pushed it. Even at 125 it felt 
like it had a lot left to give. I can't 
imagine what the 3 liter must be like. 
The transmision is so smooth that you 
would hardly notice the shift points 
unless you are conscioulsy watching the 
tach for them. Top notch car!"
car_2539,The BEST sports car out there.,"The body style is great!I don't 
understand why the editors at

would highly recommend this vehicle to 
any one looking for dynamic style and 
performance."
car_2540,Fun,"Don't understand reviewers comments

car is just pure fun to drive."
car_2541,New Cl;assic,"Great feel for the road yet, it can be 
used as an everday commuter. Plenty of

subjective. Bottom line is that its a 
fun car to drive."
car_2542,Great Car,"I bought this car loaded. CD, nav 
system, 3.0 engine,sport packeage, 
power windows power mirrors, heated 
seats, You name it this has it. Paid 
48,000 Considering I came from a ford 
expedition at 42,000 I thought it was a 
great buy with all the options."
car_2543,WOW!!,"Who'd ever thought a car can renew the 
excitement you get from driving.  
Everyday, it seems like I try to come 
up with an excuse to drive my Z4.  It 
handles like a dream and accelerates 
like a rocket.  I looked at a S2000, 
but the Z4 has so much more room, 
especially in the trunk."
car_2544,Bomb Ass Beemer,"I have never had so much fun driving a 
vehicle. Not only does the Z4 turn 
heads, it is a joy to drive."
car_2545,4th BMW Ragtop,"We have owned three BMW's in the 300 
series all convertibles, in the last 10 
years.  With each model, improvements 
were significant, as far as comfort, 
design, driving ease.  The last model 
was a 330 csi which to us was the best 
of the lot.After driving the 330csi for 
the last three years, it was time for a 
new Beamer.  After much family 
discussion, we decided to try the Z4.  
It is truly a finely made roadster.  
The Z4 
drives and handles just fantastic, and 
the auto/manual transmission is a 
blast.  It's a fun car to operate. Test 
drive this spirited Z4, and you'll know 
why we have fallen in love with it."
car_2546,OhSoHot,"A classic Roadster. Nice improvement 
over the Z3. Plenty of power with the 
2.5 unless you routinely wear a body 
harness and helmet. Its not a car for 
your daily commute. The ""ideal use"" 
would be short weekend getaways and 
warm weather cruising. I'm 6' 2"" and 
235 lbs, the cabin is confined but I 
feel that my body is supported well. I 
don't feel stiff and sore upon 
exiting."

heated seats with the lumbar option, i 
love the handling of the car it is fun 
fun fun"
car_2548,BMW 2003 ROADSTER,"Best looking car of the year.  Widely 
admired wherever I go.  Fun car to 
drive.  As with all BMW cars extremely 
tight and rattle free.  Excellent 
performance and reliability. First new 
car I have bought in seventeen years."
car_2549,Z4 a smile,"I love this car (4th BMW - first
2-seater).  The top can be up or down -
the exhileration is the same.  The fit
and finish are top, and the instrument
layout is clear and logical."
car_2550,Z4,"The styling of the car is quite 
different than what people are used to, 
but nevertheless the car speaks for 
itself once driven.  It is an amazing 
driving experience if of course you 
know what you are doing.  The only 
thing that bothers me sometimes, is how 
hard the suspension is.  I love the 
sports option on the 3.0i engine 
included with the sports button.
The sports button on the car actually 
does make a diference.  The already 
tuned engine, gives more power to the 
tires once the button is pressed."
car_2551,Driving in Las Vegas,"The Z4 has excellent turning ability, 
and hugs the road on challenging turns. 
I have a 2.5L and it feels like it has 
as much power as the 3 series with a 
3.0 engine.  The gas mileage is great 
24 - 30 MPG.  It handles well in rain, 
and on slippery surfaces, and climbs 
mountain roads easily. The trunk does 
hold golf clubs!  On a road trip, it 
held two suitcases, plus biking gear 
and duffle bags with the top down. The  
challenges are:  The front air dam is 
low to the ground (parking median); The 
cup holders will not hold a ""big gulp"" 
or tall glass bottle; and with the top 
up, you will rely exclusively on your 
side and rear mirrors."

fun on the turns and great on the 
striaght away"
car_2553,I loooove my first but not last BMW.,"It's so exciting to sit in -- much less 
drive!  My only complaint is that with 
the top up there is too many blind 
spots when driving and backing up! Not 
quite enough power immediately upon 
take off - should have gotten the 3.0! 
Other than that, it's flawless!"
car_2554,Funtastic,"Like driving my speed boat on the 
highway.  The first time behind the

3,ooo miles it's still makes me smile"
car_2555,Not So Hot,"Sorry to say, but my Z4 performs hot, 
but is uncomfortable, and rattles like 
a crib toy.  The trunk is so small that 
literally it won't hold a golf bag.  
The Z4 looks good, and drives well, but 
for 45 grand it should be more 
comfortable and not rattle and squeek."
car_2556,Finally,"This is an exihilarating automoble 
beginning with the test drive. Thank 
you BMW for building this super little  
car."
car_2557,Best two seater ever!,"After owning BMW for many years, the Z4 
3.0 was the first that convince me to 
get a two seater, It doesnt 
feel ""small"" at all. I love the looks, 
may be controversial because is a bit 
ahead. The trunk space is better than 
the M3 convertible and the 328iC.Very 
fun to drive (I have the 6 speed manual)

car_2560,Kid again!,"This is the most fun to drive car I have ever owned. 
I always feel like a kid again when I am driving the 
Z4, which is saying a lot for a 59 year old man. The 
car is very forgiving of any driving errors and its 
ability to stop is amazing.
The style of the car is apparently of some 
controversy. I can only tell you that I like the style 
and it grows on you with time. I find that its gets 
quite a lot attention as I drive."
car_2561,I sold a Porsche 996 to buy a z4,"I've driven most sports cars including 
a ferrari, a lamborgini, two porches,

doors off of all of them.  Its amazing."
car_2562,Need more on the inside,"The car is small, not much more they 
could do for comfort. For that price 
more should have been included like 
Mercedes. We were told BMW's are such 
great cars they don’t need to include 
the fluff. I strongly disagree.  At 
that price, heated seats, CD changer, 
automatic softop, dimmer light, car 
mats should ALL BE INCLUDED. Customer 
service-lousy. The car is gone as soon 
as the fun wares off. My daughter 
drives a ercedes and we are having 
second thoughts. If you want fun, go 
for it. If you want comfort, class, 
fluff, and great customer service: Look 
elsewhere. Feel free to email me with

car_2565,Z4,"Excellent roadster.  At the cutting 
edge of technology and style.  Many 
accolades received from other roadster 
owners."
car_2566,2 Thumbs up,"This ia a very fun car.  I opted for 
the 2.5 straight 6 and am quite pleased 
with its acceleration.  At higher 
speeds the engine stresses but only 
slightly.  If you are planning on doing 
excessive high speed driving, I think 
the 3.0 is the only way to go.  The 
difference in cost between the 2.5 & 
the 3.0 is substantial, so it's 
important  you really know what you 
want from your car.  The feel is strong 
and safe. Extremely well built car.  I 
would buy another without second 
thoughts."
car_2567,Love Struck,"As with all BMW's quality is tops with 
the Z4 roadster.  It's a fun ride, very 
responsive maneuvering, and it's speed 
is impressive. This is not a car, it's 
a machine."

car_2569,Great Car,"Great car that handles the road well with lots 
of nice features.   I highly recommend getting 
the sports package upgrade."
car_2570,Solid improvement over the Z3,"Prior owner of a Z3 which was also a 
great automobile.  However the 
ergonomic improvements from the top to 
the trunk including the handling 
capabilities make the Z4 a solid 
improvement over the Z3.  I loved the 
classic look of the Z3.  The Z4's more 
modern look is starting to grow on me. 
I have not seen anything in the Z4's 
price range that I like better."

car_2573,3.0 Z4 is the best of the roadsters,"I recently drove every roadster under 
$60,000, including the Boxter, Nissan 
Z, Honda, etc.  Without qualification, 
the BMW is the superior all-around car-
pure fun, great power, superb quality, 
and I-  unlike the magazine critics-  
love the style.  So do lots of other 
people, as I've gotten great reaction 
when driving.  No other two-seater in 
its class has the total package- & 
plenty of trunk space for groceries. 
BMW picks up the service for 4 years!  
This is the most fun car I have ever 
had."
car_2574,Fun but Uncomfortable,"This car is a lot of fun to drive, 
especially with the top down.  With 
the top up, there is a lot of rattling 
noises and a very bumpy, unpleasant 
ride.  I would not recommend this as 
an everyday car."
car_2575,bmwdude,AWESOME.  FASTER THAN A CORVETTE.
car_2576,Black 2.5i Convertible,I purchased this one owner car for my wife.  It is in amazing condition.  The handling is great and it is a real head turner.
car_2577,"Sunday Cruiser, Backroad Buster","BMW's low profile, snearing, snarling front end is what attracted me to the Z3 model. With it's flared wheelwells, shark-gill slits and flattend eyebrow headlamps it just speaks motion.    After two Corvettes (a 1970, and a 1980), the Z3 had to perform to keep my interest. WOW!  Does it perform. With the 3.0 liter engine and AUTOstick tranny, full power burnouts are the norm with the DSC in the off position. The in-line SIX is both smooth and linear, it pulls right from idle and revs quickly.   This car is by far the most FUN I've ever had out on the road. And, it turns heads where ever I go with it.   Probably the best bang for the buck in sportscar driving! Try on a Z3 for yourself."
car_2578,Bye bye Z3; I'm gonna miss you.,"I've had the Z since 5/02 and have put 10K miles on it, driving in good weather only. It is drafty, noisy and uncomfortable. The sound system is boomy with the top up and muddy with it down. Buying a rear windscreen helped a lot. The M3 leather seats are too hot and too tight and it's hard to find a comfortable position. The plastic window is impossible to clean as are the premium wheels. It's hard to get in and out of. But... The paint quality is great; it really shines up. The torque is incredible; downshifts aren't required for highway passing. The 5 speed is smooth; the steering precise. The DSC helped me a few times. The car is just getting broken in. I'm gonna miss it."
car_2579,Fun car but....,"Had a 318i for 7 years- never a problem with repairs, etc. Only got rid of it because it had 100,000+ miles on it and was worried it might start breaking down. Bought the Z3 as a preowned vehicle - with warranty. Have had it in shop countless times, last time being it needed a new radiator - have had lots of repair issues, it is now just out of warranty and I am hoping it will not break down any more. Love the car, it's cute and fun but disappointed in repairs so far. Other BMWs superior to this one :("
car_2580,The Z3 is the car of my dreams,"I bought the 3.0 on 02.2004 and since
then, I can say that is so fun to drive.
Everyone loves it!!!I installed the BMW
Harman Kardon Traffic Pro GPS system
The Z3 is a real classic."
car_2581,Fun to Drive,"If you are considering this vehicle, 
don't hesitate any longer.   The Z3 is 
FUN and the quality and workmanship is 
outstanding."
car_2582,4mike,"I purchased a ""certified preowned"" Z3 
with 100K extended warrenty.  Although 
I paid more, the peace of mind with the 
extended warrentey provided peace of 
mind.  the car is fun to drive and plan 
to keep it a long time.  I am very 
satisfied with my purchase."
car_2583,Great car,"I purchased my Bimmer new and have 
driven it a little over 11,000 miles 
with out any problems. Fun to drive and 
sure makes heads turn. Don't know why 
they replaced with Z4. More room 
possibly. I love it and will cherish it 
for many years to come."
car_2584,Most Fun w/o a women involved,"Z3 Coupe is fast and responsive. Point 
and shoot steering. Great in the rain. 
More curb appeal than a Ferrari. No 
mechanical problems / only routine 
maint."
car_2585,You have to drive one,"There is nothing bad to say,  this car 
Handles(and I have raced 
professionally). And who can say 
anything negative about the style. I do 
wish she came with a glass 
rear window. One other thing is how 
quite (for a convertible) the car is 
with the top up, I have not been able 
to compare her with the Audi or Porchse 
but she is the quitest I have been in. 
Also with the rear wind screen up, it 
is surprisingly calm in the cockpit, 
and I have taken it up to 110 mph with 
top down.  I store her in winters so I 
can not say how she handles in snow, 
but if your state uses salt on the 
roads why are you driving THIS car in 
the snow anyway!?!"
car_2586,sporty roadster,"If you are looking for a FAST roadster 
that can take sharp corners at 80mph, 
this is your car. At least test drive 
this car before you buy any roadster. 
BMW's Z3 is about the ride...great 
performance, great turning capability, 
surprisingly smooth ride even when not 
going at high speeds, and plenty of 
luxury for a sports car (mine has a 
power convertible top, power seats, 
heated seats, cd player).
I also test drove an SLK and liked it 
for other reasons...but really, they 
are entirely different cars so test 
drive both and you'll know how they 
are different."
car_2587,Best car I've had,"No factory defects, No down time, 
basic service only"
car_2588,Can't beat a BMW,"Sorry to Honda and Infiniti and all 
other cars, but nothing beats a BMW."
car_2589,exceeded expectations,"Press the gas pedal and the car 
responds in any gear, at any RPM 
level.  Acceleration is smooth not 
jerky, while the engine hums lowwww.  
Quiet for a convertible up to ~ 
80mph.  The wind guard (accessory)
makes top-down driving comfortable at 
higher speeds and cooler weather.  
More room and comfort than the Boxster."
car_2590,Zooooooom,"Car is REALLY fun to drive!  Handling 
is outstanding and with the 3.0 engine 
and sports package you go out of your 
way to find roads with hilly curves.  
I've been surprised at how comfortable 
the over-the-road ride is.  Downside is 
it's terrible in snow...Eskimos look 
for an SUV."
car_2591,I like it,"I had Toyota spyer before this one.  
NO match.  This is two class up.  I 
have automatic.  I wish I have manual 
shift. Some say about S2000 but it's 
not BMW. Everyone love the look around 
here (IDAHO!!!) With snow tire and DSC 
winter is no problem."
car_2592,My second Z3,"I owned a '00 2.3 for 3 1/2 years and just 
moved into the 3.0. In all that time I've never 
found a vehicle that can beat it for fun/
performance/value. Here's to another 3 
years of driving pleasure."
car_2593,Unique,"Bought the car because it is so unique, 
not allot of people have one.  Many may 
not like the way it looks, but I think 
it looks great.  Added some DINAN 
upgrades and WOW, nice improvement!  
The car really involves you in 
driving.  Met plenty of people at work 
and at the gym who first don’t like the 
coupe, but soon tend to change their 
mind.  Its easy to follow the crowd, I 
wanted a car that helps me stand out."
car_2594,fun and exciting,"A real drivers roadster.Push it 
hard,enjoy the fel of a great 
engine,and just what a roadster should 
be.This car makes me smile big time."
car_2595,The red baron flies again,"I've owned this Z3 coupe for nearly 4 
months and it just keeps getting better 
and better.  It is like riding a guided 
missle - scary fast amazing!  I 
honestly don't have the skill yet to 
get all the handling and speed of which 
this car is capable.  It really draws 
the looks and questions too - total 
fun.  Its even a bit more fun after I 
added the Dinan stage 2 cold air and 
chip."
car_2596,Tradition of racing,"The style of this car will always be 
one of tradition and class.  The 
handling and responsiveness are 
exhilarating, but can be improved with 
a worthwhile $3,000 investment in a 
Dinan S Package."
car_2597,Love My 3.0i,"It just snowed about 2"" and the drive 
home was great. OEM Dunlops and DSC 
kept the car on the road with no 
issues. I tried turning the DSC off and 
nearly ended up in a ditch, I can't 
imagine driving in slick condtions 
without DSC. The top is very tight, no 
leaks, even when parked outside in 
blowing snow. 2 speed seat heaters work 
very well, just when it feels like 'HI' 
is too much, the seat has automatically 
turned the heat to 'LOW'."
car_2598,Review,"Nobody builds engines like BMW. Strong, 
sweet, smooth, responsive, effortless 
all the way to redline. Quick and 
beautiful transmission. Handles 
incrediblely with balance and agility. 
Quality, quality, that's what it's all 
about."
car_2599,My Fun Toy,"Its a very fun car to drive and draws a 
lot of attention. But they have to 
upgrade the cheap plastic interior 
parts and rear window"
car_2600,fun vehicle,"This is a fun vehicle. If you're 
looking for a top down driving with for 
2 people, it's hard to beat this car. 
S2000 may come close but it doesn't 
have the comfort of Z3..."
car_2601,2001 Z3 Review,"This is my third Z3, the others were a 
1.9 and a 2.8.  This car is awesome to 
drive and turns heads everywhere we 
go.  The Harmon Kardon sound system is 
top notch.  Performance is exciting 
with 225 hp and a 5.9 0-60.  Fuel 
economy averages 21 miles per gallon.  
All hardware is solid inside and out.  
Very comfortable even on long trips 
thanks to great seats.  Wind noise and 
motion is minimal with a windscreen 
option.  Handling is near perfection 
in curves or any weather."
car_2602,My BMW,"In general I love my Z3. It obviously 
has some flaws but the overall driving 
experience is very positive. If I had 
to do it over again I would probably 
purchase a Honda S2000 instead."
car_2603,wow,"a woman magnet, sharp interior and
exterior. superior ride, smooth carefree
transmission."
car_2604,Love It!,"After eight months and 5100 miles I 
still love this car! Despite 
conflicting reviews, the styling is the 
reason I bought it (I watched ""Hostage"" 
at BMWfilms.com and was immediately 
hooked). Fully loaded (except nav.), I 
recently added a hardtop and winter 
tires/wheels. I upgraded to the 3.0i 
with the sport package because I liked 
the wheels better. Wood interior trim 
is classier than aluminum. This is my 
first BMW, but definately not my last!"
car_2605,Z Fore Fun,"Fun, turns heads, clean look inside with the 
creature comforts you'd expect from a $40K 
car and BMW.  The ride is like a sports car, you 
feel the road but that's what I was looking for.  
The engine sounds deep and smooth and will 
get you up to the speed limit fast enough for 
most commuters.  The top goes down fast (10 
sec) with little wind at speed."
car_2606,awesome!,this car is awesome
car_2607,Best Ever,"I had a 2000 Z3, Everything that I did 
not like in that car has been changed 
in the Z4.  The Z4 is a dream to drive 
keep up the good work."
car_2608,Pure Fun,"The Z4 is pure fun. This car is highly 
responsivee, handles well at all 
speeds, and is smooth riding. The sport 
package adds to the experience. The 
powertop drops in 10 seconds, and you 
can lower it while stopped at a traffic 
light. I have owned this car for 7 
months. It has been an exceptionally 
pleasing purchase."
car_2609,LOVE THE BMW  Z4,"I HAVE BEEN ENTHRALLED WITH THIS CAR 
EVER SINCE I TRADED IN MY Z3 FOR THIS 
ONE---I DONT HAVE A BAD THING TO SAY 
ABOUT IT"
car_2610,My Baby,"I am 16 years old and my daddy bought 
me this car on the 14th of October. I 
absolutly love my car, and so does 
everyone else. My only problem is the 
amount of space in the car, yet it 
isn't enough of an issue to tarnish the 
way I feel about my car. I would 
recommend it to anyone who wants a well 
made, sporty car."
car_2611,My Z4,"Love the verall car. Beautiful to look 
at, great to drive.  A true current 
classic"
car_2612,Love my Z4,"This car turns heads everywhere..Drives 
like a dream"
car_2613,TONS OF FUN!,"GREAT CAR, SOLID HANDELING AND FAST OFF 
THE MARK.  OVER ALL BEST IN CLASS."
car_2614,Z Best!,"I was sold on the Z4 with my test drive!
I opted for the five-speed automatic, 
which has been a perfect choice for 
someone who wants to have fun, but 
doesn't want the hassle of a clutch, 
especially in traffic. It is quick, 
responsive, and takes corners better 
than our 2000 Porsche Cabriolet."
car_2615,Wow?,"Gorgeous? Yes.
Ugly? Maybe
Different? Yes.
Eye catching? Yes.
Powerful? Y E S !!!

The Z4 isn't a car made to appeal to 
everyone's taste in cars.  Only those 
who can appreciate the performance and 
beauty of a BMW.  This is a car that 
has fluid lines (though some are kind 
of ""out there""), moves gracefully, and 
looks like nothing else out there.  It 
also, when hammered, carves the road 
like a brand new scalpel.  The exhaust 
note is orgasmic and the power seems 
endless.  I have a 3.0 Z4 but I drove 
the 2.5 and even though the 3.0 has a 
more powerful engine, the 2.5 drove 
like it would have no problems keeping 
up."
car_2616,BMW Z4,"I have the v-6, the car is a great car 
for performance and power, however, the 
car does burn a hell of lot of gas, but 
then again, when you pay over 42000, 
for a sports car, you can't complain 
too much about gas.

The car is extremely fun to drive and I 
love the automatic top that you don
t have to latch yourself."
car_2617,A dream to drive for 3 days,"This was a loaner. I drove the heck out 
of it.  It corners like on rails.  
Acceleration was smooth.  Never 
oncehydroplaned in rain.  The most 
ironic thing is that the car got hit 
on: at the gas station, at the grocery 
store, at the ofcie supply place.  My 
only complaint as it got pushed around 
by the wind from Semis when you drive 
at above 80MPH.  But it gets stared a 
and is a blast to drive."
car_2618,BMW Evaluation,"BMW is a car that you spend more money 
fixing it than your car payments. The 
BMW corp and specially Santa Monica 
dealership have stolen so much from me."
car_2619,Watch that paint!,"This is a wonderful car to drive. The
2.5 is a little sluggish from the line
but makes up for this with impressive
high speed power on the highway and in
the turns. The car is an attention
getter. The top works well and quickly.
The paint job on this car leaves a
little to be desired. This is a $40k
with features, but it has the paint job
of a car costing about $10k. This car
scratches easily. It requires copious
amounts of wax to cover these imperfections."
car_2620,AWSOME,"THE BEST CAR U CAN DRIVE BEATS 
MERCEDES CARS IN THE SAME AND OVER 
LIKE $20000 PRICE RANGE EASILY AND CAN 
EVEN COMPETE WITH A PORSCHE 911 BEATS 
ALL CARS FORM ITS CLASS AROUND $20000 
ABOVE ITS PRICE RANGE!!!. THIS CAR IS 
SUPER FUN THE PRICE.COMES WITH ALMOST 
EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT IN A CAR! 
FORGET THE NISSAN 350Z or the HONDA 
S2000 OR THE MAZDA RX* AND SURELY 
FORGET THE MERCEDES BECAUSE THIS BEATS 
ALL OF THEM BY FAR!!!."
car_2621,My Z's,"I had previously leased a 2001 Z3 
Roadster because I wasn't sure if I 
wanted to own the BMW. I loved the Z3 
and at the close of the lease I went to 
the dealer to purchase it. In 2 years I 
had driven 42000 miles and loved every 
mile. Well I test drove the Z4 and 
decided to purchase the 2003 Z4. So far 
I am not sorry."
car_2622,My First BMW,"After a considerable amount of research, I purchased my first BMW about six weeks ago, a Maldives Blue over Beige, 2005 Z4 2.5i roadster with only 13,400 miles. I also have a 1977 MGB; guess I really like roadsters. After looking for a Z3M for a reasonable price, I turned my attention to the Z4. The reviews on the Z4 were, for the most part, glowing and I can say that this is the funnest car to drive I have ever owned.

The power - even with the 2.5, is impressive, but its ability to stick to the road, its handling and its looks make it a winner in my book.  It's a lot of fun to drive and to look at!"
car_2623,Driving the dream,"This is my first z4 and so far I love driving it. I find my self taking the long way to the stores just to enjoy the drive. I love its sleek, compact and agile performance. People keep telling me I should have traded at 40k but I think I am going to keep it well over 200,000 mile and maybe then some. I call my z4 my mini me."
car_2624,Z4 is a blast!,"Wow! The Z4 is pure driving excitement! The vehicle has opened up the world of weekend roadtrips for me, but instead of using the GPS, I find myself reading a map to determine an alternate route to my destination. The highways are fun, but the Z4 really shines on the back roads. Some words that come to mind to describe this vehicle are; responsive, tight, nimble, classy, smooth and deceivingly quick. Do not expect a luxury ride from the Z4, but expect to feel the road. It is a performance vehicle. That being said, I am 6'2"" and once in the vehicle I am quite comfortable, even on long road trips. I am guaranteed a smile every time I take my Z4 for a drive. :-)"
car_2625,WOW,"WOW and to think we waited over three years to finally find and purchase our dream machine. 05 with 22K, CPO and extended maintenance plan, and fully loaded. The tires are pretty sensitive to less than perfect roads and you'll find yourself driving with two hands on the wheel.  We actually like the cup holders and the radio rocks!"
car_2626,TomBond,"sweet sports car, classy style"
car_2627,THE Coupe,"It's actually my first time writing a review on a car, I was looking for a sport cart 8 months ago. My first choice was a Porscha Cayman S with a manual transmission. I am not going to bring back the whole Porscha vs BM discussion but let's say you will have to try the car to know what you really want. I did love the Porscha but couldnt resist to test the Z4. My only concerns about the Z4 was the look and I really didnt like it in the beginning cause all I could find here in Canada was SoftTop Z4. The driving experience of the Z4 3.0Si was magic yes I said it MAGIC. You do feel like you're driving a beast, nervous and everytime you step on the pedal you get the ""push"" of adrenaline..."
car_2628,My 2008 Z4 convertible,Very dependable. Lots of cool features.Comfortable and very easy to drive.Fast when need be. Hugs the road.
car_2629,Fun Fun Fun,"This car is nothing but fun to drive, the steering is a little startling on grooved or rough pavement, Sports Package). Takes off in any gear even on the interstate. MPG is amazing for a performance car of this caliber. If you can afford one, go and buy one. Best to get a CPO as opposed to buying a new one, save some serious cash. Mine had only 19K on it. Make sure you get the SI model as opposed to the i the difference in horsepower is worth it. Watch out for cement bumpers, get too close and you will mess up that one piece front bumper. Also watch out for pot holes, not much clearance on the underside."
car_2630,Certified Fun,I have been waiting patiently for the opportunity to own a Z4 and the day finally came. I purchased a CPO car so that I would have warranty coverage just in case. I couldn't have gotten a better deal or a better car. The performance is top notch. I smile every time I get in or out. I got the Steptronic manual with the Sport package and the paddle shifters on the steering wheel. I love the power top and heated seats. This thing is the most fun you can have for 31K.
car_2631,Perfect after changing tires,"WOW! I replaced the Bridgestons RF (run flat) tires, with Michelin Pilot Sport ASXL. The ride with the sports suspension, improved significantly, and eliminated the jolting, without compromising the handling. As a bonus, it may enable me to use the car year around in Upstate NY, without having to invest in snow tires, and if I can get even close to the projected 40K miles tread life, I will be even happier."
car_2632,Fun car,"The standard suspension may be the better choice for most people.  I have only 300 miles on the manual transmission coupe, and really enjoy it, but I will install all season ties when I have to replace the OE tires. This may soften the ride and extend the time you can drive the car in the Northeast before installing snow tries."
car_2633,Donkey Cart,"I purchased the coupe off the showroom floor with the sports suspension package. The roads in Northern Illinois are not the best so my wife refers to the Z4 as ""the donkey cart"".  Regardless it is a blast to drive and I get many compliments on its appearance.  The dealer experience has been outstanding."
car_2634,I love it sooooo much,"I am a mother of four kids whose oldest one just got her license - so we are a three car family. But who needs three big cars? Not us! I work full time and drive frequently for work - and this car brings a thrill to even the most mundane errand. I finally got a toy for myself, and I have no regrets whatsoever. The mileage is good and it is incredibly fun to drive - I am the envy of all my friends. I think it is a BEAUTIFUL SEXY car and I will be in tears when the lease is up. Might just have to get another one!"
car_2635,Own one and you'll understand!,"This is my first Z4, I have always had Porsches, my last one was a Cayman S. Let me tell you about my Z4 in a nut shell... it's impressive design and agility gave me what I needed to get off my Cayman and look into my ""now present and future"" BMW relationship.  The car handles like its on rails, it brakes like no other car I've driven before and to top it all on wet surfaces you can not even tell that you are driving in the rain, it just feels like a 997 Turbo handling in a smaller car.  I will definitely get another BMW after my lease is up on this baby.  I will recommend to anyone that is looking for performance, safety and value at the same time.  A real head-turner!  Enjoy it"
car_2636,I call it my little zippy for a reason!,"I just recently purchased this car.  And oh what a car it is.  The handling on the Z4 is amazing, not to mention it's one sexy car.  Options that are musts are the leather for easier clean-up with a convertible, the premium package with the auto top, as well as the heated seats so that you can take advantage of the top down on cooler nights.  Don't waste your money on the upgraded speaker system. The one it has is amazing!  My husband is 6'3"" and has plenty of headroom.  However it is a little cumbersome to get out of compared to a normal car.  But hey, you are driving a sports machine who cares right!"
car_2637,Great CPO purchase,"This is a very nice choice for a 2-seat convertible. The ride with the hard-top up is very quiet. It is surprisingly comfortable and roomy for taller drivers. I find the throttle response a bit lagging in ""normal"" mode, but the ""sport"" mode is much better, making it quick and responsive.  It feels very solid. No rattles. I have had mine for about 4.5 months. Got a very fair deal on it as a CPO BMW with warranty until 2019. It is a very good-looking car, especially in black, which matches the front windshield pillars. No problems at all with it so far."
car_2638,"Dream, or Nightmare?","After my 08 Z4 was totaled by a teenager, I made the mistake of driving this car. This engine paired with the 7 speed transmission is the best drive-train I've ever driven, and that includes owning a Vette, Boxster, Jag XK, and my 08. My research showed an all-too-common complaint with the fuel pump failure and oil overheating. Knowing this, I still bought this car. I may regret it someday but unlike most modern muscle, this car gives you mega-power below 2K revs and keeps it through 5K with little or no turbo lag. Compare with the M3 which gives you almost nothing until you hit 4500 revs. The M3 may be the better track car, but I drive on the street. Nothing else can match this Z for daily use."
car_2639,SO much fun!!,"Just purchased the re-designed Z4. I have owned three Z4's, kept trying to talk myself into liking the previous version, to no avail. The new Z4 is a winner. The interior is roomier both in length and width, which is great for my 6' frame. The 3.0 has plenty of power. The only options I got were auto and heated seats. The body is rigid but not abusive when driving. Easily a commuter car. The styling is flawless - be prepared for people staring at you. If you can find an '09, grab it, BMW is giving a $5000 cash rebate if you finance. Mine had a sticker of $49k and I got it for $39,300!! Can't' wait for summer! I turned in a Lexus IS250 Vert - Lexus = fun to RIDE in, BMW = fun to DRIVE!!"
car_2640,BEST OF BOTH WORLDS: Eye Catcher Plus!,"Always wanted a convertible, never enjoyed softtops. Always loved BMWs, owned a 325i, so I watched with anticipation when they released the new BMW Z4. The car is totally impractical, overpriced, but when my local dealer offered me a killer lease, $500/loaded SDrive35 and BMW finance also kicked in a rebate, I said,""You only live once."" and drove off in my first convertible. The car is stunning, a true beauty in the Deep Sea Blue Metallic and Ivory White Nappa Leather, just like in the ads. I get looks and compliments constantly and I have only seen a red SD30 once on the road in the months I've owned it. In this economy, the car is rare eye-catcher. Anyone with a BMW knows, driving is #1."
car_2641,Best car yet,"I've had this car for about two weeks and it has been a blast to drive around town. The power is endless, but it has a refined quality to it. The sound of the turbos when I drop the hammer is music to my ears. The car sits very low on the road with the sports package, but with the 19in wheels it feels like it's planted to the asphalt."
car_2642,BMW Z4 instant classic,"Having loved my first roadster, a 2000 Z3 I was disappointed by the style changes with the first Z4. The 2009 Z4 brings back the beautiful lines with several improvements. The car fits like a glove, handles with incredible accuracy, and for the most part gives you the best of both a convertible and a comfortable sedan. This is my third roadster (also 2003 Boxster). Car came with sport shift paddles (I still don't get). Would have preferred a manual. The 3.0 automatic had plenty of power to match my driving style and I actually preferred to the 3.5. Bottom line, this is a gorgeous car that is a blast to drive."
car_2643,Great Roadster,"I have only owned this Z4 for two months and love every minute I have owned it. I had  2006 z4, the 2009 is a much nicer car,looks, ride, comfort handling it is awesome. Build quality is excellent. It is one of the sexiest roadsters ever built, I had a car collector friend of mine tell me that nothing large colection of exotics looks any better the new Z4. I chose white with black leather. 23 mpg city and 31 mpg on road trips. The most fun car I have owned including two porsche's."
car_2644,WOW My First BMW,"In my younger days I owned two MGs and 2 Vettes, those cars don't hold a candle to the Z4.  I have had the car a little less than a week, unfortunately I can't drive it everyday because I need my Prius to get into the HOV.  The car handles superbly and is very comfortable.  The 30i auto is still fast and saves some money.  Amazingly the car looks as good with the top up as with it down.  Upgraded stereo, it rocks.  I have all of the packages except the convenience package, car brought from another dealer and did not have the package.  I guess BMW has really improved the iDrive, it is fun to use coupled with voice commands, it will only take a couple of years to learn how to operate."
car_2645,Simply Amazing,"This is my first roadster and I will say it exceeded my every expectation. Fast, great handling, and so on.  People keep trying to compare this car to the Boxter, but BMW didn't try to compete with that car. The Z4 is an everyday car that also transforms to a sports convertible, they clearly went after the SLK. This car gets looks wherever it goes and you will feel like a rock star sporting this thing. Also, all the the safety features on this car will help keep you out of trouble, I should know it has already saved me."
car_2646,Superb automobile,"Only owned this car two days . I am blown away with it already. Had 06 Z4 thought I would never get rid of it. May not be the ultimate sports car but it is exactly what I want. Have had the supercharged hot rods already. This car is fast , classy, and quality built. The nappa white interior is awesome. Top impresses even my Mercedes buds! This is the first car I have owned in my 39 years of marriage my wife likes. What can I say?"
car_2647,The best I ever had,This car is unbelievable - it is a man's or woman's forbidden pleasure. It really looks very unique with its fine lines and very responsive handling and power. I just got it yesterday and already know that I will treasure it for as long as god will allow me to.
car_2648,Great so far,"Just got the car so it is tough to tell on reliability and long term build quality. However this is my 2nd BMW Convertible and the first was great.  Car is smooth, quick and fun.  It is more a cruiser than a sports car, but plenty quick and smooth."
car_2649,2009 z4 review,"Quick, stable, comfortable, fun to drive and superb cabin atmosphere, but too heavy roadster. Should go on diet to match boxster driving experience."
car_2650,Awesome,"Traded in my 08 Z4 for this new 2009 Z4. Left the dealership with my wife turned directly onto the interstate for our first ride. We looked at each other and said and said awesome. There are no comparisons to the ride of this vehicle, smooth and in control, you want to take this on a long trip. Vehicle equipped with the double clutch 7 speed transmission, you can't feel it change gears. Got the Ivory White interior, a great upgrade well worth the price. Had looked at the 650c and almost purchased one because of the ride of the old Z4 glad I waited, this new Z4 is a blast. For us older guys this car is easier to get in and out. The 300hp is going to be fun. I think we will like this for years."
car_2651,Highly recommend!,"We purchased this car new in 05 and it has been outstanding. Not a single thing has gone wrong in 40k miles, it gets 32+ mpg on the freeway and combined mileage is 25-26 -- all much higher than estimated! The free services have been great too."
car_2652,Starship Enterprise for the road,This car is my first BMW having had an 07 Mustang prior to this purchase. This car is a dream to drive with me looking for an excuse to drive the car wherever I can. It handles like it's on rails. It looks like no other BMW and easily turns heads. It's driving at its purest unadulterated form with a chassis that flatters your senses.
car_2653,The Civilized (and legal) go-kart,"This is my second car (and first BMW). Good God....I just realized what I've been missing. I moved to this car from an 07 Mustang. The acceleration is blistering and the car handles like it's on rails. To make it more insane, just initiate the Sport button and it goes like stink. This is driving in its purest unadulterated form which convinces me why BMW's are the ultimate driving machine. I used to take the metro in to work everyday however after getting the car, I drive in just because it brings a huge smile to my face and is the perfect anti-dote to a hectic day and NO I'm not exaggerating. It looks fantastic and flatters you. So much for getting a bike."
car_2654,Ultimate driving machine,"This car may have the best design of any convertible on the market. BMW is not known for interior bells and whistles, so creature comforts are sparse but they make up for the lack with exceptional performance and safety. Great trunk room for the size of vehicle, better than stated mileage (31mpg hwy) and once you're in, quite comfortable. Entering and exiting requires a bit of agility but it's a sports car. The 3.0 probably has all the pep ever needed for this size vehicle. The 2.5, that I have is quite functional, just not quite as nimble as the styling dictates but very adequate. Traded a Miata and what a step up. This car fees much more substantial than its size and I love the styling!"
car_2655,Only 2.0L but still a lot of fun,"I went for the 2.0L rather than 3.0L (the in between 2.5L made no sense to me) because it is a long term car so running costs are important.  The lighter engine means this is the best handling car I have ever driven.  I can blast round beds, be they sharp corners or sweepers at speeds that make my hair tingle.  I used to race stock cars and have had a Morgan +8 - the Zed 4 is better.  Blasted across Germany at 90-120mph and got 41 miles per gallon.  I live in London and still get 30mpg.  I love the looks (pre-facelift) and always stare at the car when leaving it.  Driving does not get much better."
car_2656,First Bimmer,"I thought a Harley would satisfy my craving for a ""fun"" vehicle. It didn't. Few months after selling it, I found myself looking at the Miata. Drove one and immediately decided nope. Next found myself looking at the Z4. I absolutely love the styling. Knew nothing about them. Saw a Merlot 05 and fell in love. Drove my first BMW a couple of days later and knew I was hooked. Well I bought an 05 Merlot and haven't looked back. Best car in the galaxy. Fun, fun, fun and it does turn heads. Gas mileage ensures the fact this was a great decision. Need to change out the run flats and need warmer weather then the fun begins again. You gotta try one of these if you don't do anything else with your life!"
car_2657,This car is a Gift,"I just came back from driving this car from Montreal to California and back with my 12 year old son. I logged 10000 miles without a problem except worn rear wheels and a nail, the red light came on telling me I had a flat, nice feature, but not a problem with runflat, drove 10 miles to a garage that could fix it. It was a dream to drive on route 1 of the California coast and through the Arizona Desert. This was a trip of  lifetime, and lots of  room in the trunk for 2 people on a month long trip, really, well summer time in the heat, not many pants to take space, packed light, but lots of room, I would drive 12 hours straight, not sore at all no need to stop and 'stretch'. fun great car!!!"
car_2658,Love My Merlot Roadster!,"I've waited 40 years for this narcissistic NOT a ""mom"" car and was debating b/w the mercedes slk and the Z4. I could not be happier with my choice! Fun to drive, had it a week and its great! I was worried about road noise compared to the hard top SLK, but there was very little difference.  We replaced the run flat tires immediately and it made a huge difference in the ""comfort"" of the ride.  BMW service is unsurpassed and the style is unbeatable.  For the price and reliability I give it a ""10"".  If you're on the fence, commit, it's worth it! The power top is a must!"
car_2659,rear ended after owning car for 4 days,"For the short time I had this car before being rear-ended, I loved it.  If you ever have the misfortune of being hit (3 times before she stopped) from behind by someone doing 45 mph, know that this car is definitely well-engineered.  I walked away from the accident with only whiplash.  It could have been much worse had I still been driving the miata mx5 I owned previously.  Fun to drive, I just hope I can look at it the same way after I get it repaired."
car_2660,Two years plus,"Being a master diesel mechanic for at a Freightliner truck dealership for  close to thirty years I believe I am a fair judge of quality. I have really enjoyed this car for over two years. When you get off work there is nothing better than jumping into your Z4, dropping the top and hitting the road. I have owned many new cars but this is the only one that is as much fun to drive now as it was when I bought it! If there was anything I would change I would redesign the drink holders as they spill  hot coffee on your leg on turns, the seats should have higher side bolsters so you don`t slide around so much on turns. And get the Xenon lights which was the only option I didn't get. BMW - great car!"
car_2661,Driving has never been this fun!!,"This car is so much fun it puts a huge smile on my face every day! Fantastic blend of power and elegance.  Economical too, I have consistently gotten 27 MPG with mostly highway driving. This car has a sporty ride but absorbs the bumps well, despite the 18"" alloys that come with the sport package. You must have the sports package, the standard 17"" rims  make the whole car look bland. The red leather interior is gorgeous. No reliability problems whatsoever. No rattles or electrical issues. The upgraded sound system is awesome. The trunk space is good, even with the top down! You can easily fit two suitcases in there, or a couple sets of golf clubs. Buy this car, you won't regret it!"
car_2662,"Performance, economy & reliability!","I've owned lots of foreign cars & sporty cars, but never a BMW before & if the Z4 is indicative of all BMWs, I'm a convert. In 42,000 miles, the care has only been in the shop for regular maintenance (FREE!) & that's only about every 15,000 miles. The Z4 is hands down the most practical sports car I've owned. Combined fuel economy is 25.5 mpg. The original tires lasted 40,000 miles. I'm 6'2"" & it's comfortable, even for long trips. I drive lots on 2 lane country roads & the passing power is excellent. The Steptronic transmission is fun or easy & I love the sport drive feature. My next car will definitely be a BMW if this one ever wears out!"
car_2663,Too many problems,"The car is good performance wise, fast, fuel economy better than expected. But it is not reliable and poorly built. Had problems with the retractable hood, steering wheel jammed, side windows not going down, memory reset all with in 18 months of ownership. Even today, sometimes when I close a window it goes all the way up and then comes down and one has to repeat several times before it shuts. After filing a formal complaint no action was taken by BMW. I have paid a lot of money for the car and at least expected a formal apology. Will never buy another BMW."
car_2664,A Class Apart,"I tested a number of convertibles under $35K before buying the Z4 but none came close to the value and performance of the BMW. The Z4, even with the smaller 2.5 liter engine, is an impressive performer. It has a strong power curve in gears 3-5 and plenty of torque in 1st and 2nd. The Z4 is plenty fast, but if you want to run with the big boys, get the 3.0 liter and the six speed. The cornering and handling is very good but a notch below more serious sports cars like the Boxster. You will fall in love with the sound of the exhaust. My only complaint is the noticeable electronic steering assist at low speed. You can buy a one year old low mileage Z4 fully loaded for the low $30s!"
car_2665,Love it!,I love my Z4! It handles extremely well in the rain. It's a great looking car inside and out. I leased it but am planning to buy it because I can not be without my Z. :)
car_2666,A real value,There's little I would change or request. Just wish they would refine the lines on the back like they did in front!
car_2667,My red Z4,"The car is my daily driver.  I love the ease of the manual roof.  Opens and closes in one quick motion, can close it at 40 mph (do this when it rains).   Smooth engine and excellent 5 speed is addictive.  Good torque.  Unbelievable handling.  Good ride.  Phenomenal standard stereo.  Get heated seats (my only option).  Had a few problems but BMW fixed them.  A hoot to drive with the stability control off.  Winter traction excellent if you buy winter tires (mine are Hankook), but snow and ice traction is terrible on stock tires.  Recently drove new S2000 and Solstice;  both very nice.  I like the feel of the BMW.  Nothing compares.  Buy the standard transmission and engine is my advice."
car_2668,Z4,"the car is fun to drive with impressive performance and excellent fuel economy. I'm 6'4"" and 240lbs, and have all the room I could ask for. the car is comfortable for me on long trips, and I have no tendency to ""kink up"""
car_2669,Jim's viewpoint.,"I've always wanted a roadster. At 55, I finally decided to quit talking about it and just do it. It's been going on a year of ownership and I must say.....this is one awesome automobile. Everytime I drive it...it's a transformation.  The car is beautiful. It handles great! It's been totally reliable with zero problems. It turns heads. My daughter loves to drive it. Two of my friends bought one. It's been a blast."
car_2670,Over 40 Club,"Ok, we have had the Z4 for seven months. It has been driven in the USA and we brought it to Germany in November 2005. My wife drives it to and from Frankfurt every four days on A3, so for the two hour and 20 minute trip four times per week it is being driven at 120 mph on average. Too bad it is a US Specs. Bimmer..."
car_2671,great fun,"I took a road trip this summer through the Rockies and the car was a gas to drive. Very responsive, comfortable for long runs and very quick. Too bad there aren't many places to open it up."
car_2672,Now I look forward to my long commute!,"Bought 2 weeks ago; what a FUN car! I'm a big guy (6'1"", 260 lbs) but still have plenty of legroom. 2 minor drawbacks - lots of squeaks from plastic parts if seat's all the way back; can't seem to get more than 19 MPG no matter how conservative I drive. Live in San Diego so I drive top down in December; heated seats are a plus! looks great, sounds great, responsive, tight steering, the perfect toy!"
car_2673,Buy Buy Buy!!!,"Regardless of its controversial looks, the performance of this car is amazing!  It rides smooth on the streets and tough on the track.  Highly recommend this one!"
car_2674,BMW just like Bob Marley& Jerry Garcia.,"Turned in my beloved Mercedes-Benz C230 Kompressor at lease end and picked up the Z4 2.5i in Silver & Black with premium pkg. So far ""Im lovin it"" I have driven 3K miles in the first two weeks.  My 8 yr old nephew says it looks like a shark and it just keeps getting better. I caught him showing it in the garage to the other kids from the neighborhood - cool!"
car_2675,BMW Z-4 3.0i,This car is perfect for a fun car.  Not practical for everyday driving to and from work.  It has been a very reliable and solid car to drive.
car_2676,Praise for my Z4,"I use my Z4 as my daily driver. After over 300,000 miles in Jeep Grand Cherokees and a Chevy Suburban, I had almost forgotten how much fun driving could be. I am surprised how comfortable the car is on a variety of surfaces - not harsh like a Porsche. Though the trunk is not cavernous, there is enough luggage space for a couple on a weekend getaway, and more than enough for me when I travel alone. Thought some would disagree, I find the styling to be unique, very attractive and quite modern. All in all, I am most satisfied with this car and suspect I will keep it for some time. By the way, 26 mpg city and 36 mpg highway is not bad either."
car_2677,Bring on the sun!,"We got this for my birthday, and it has been exhilirating the whole time. It was really tough to drive through the break-in period, because it showed it had so much more! I have rarely put the top up since then (California has sun from April to November, with little rain), and love the handling, performance (aren't those Boxster drivers surprised!), and the sheer feel of luxury. Cornering is amazing --  it can handle much more than I can! I wish I'd bought this several years ago ..."
car_2678,Roadster God Z4!!!,"I bought a CPO z4 3.0 with the steptronic tranny heated seats, sports and premium package. This car is a god of the road. If you try it, I PROMISE you will buy it. It has breakneck speed, awesome sound system, nice engine sounds, looks beautiful (especially sterling grey)  I get at least one compliment on this car every single day. I bought mine for 32.5K with 16K miles on it. Get an 03, since their is no real difference between 03 to 05!!!!  Just drive it, trust me!!"
car_2679,not too bad,"Not the world's greatest car, but a lot of fun, works well, made well and good value for the money with special lease deals now on. but it is not a lux car like my 911 that went off lease. I got this because I have just retired and was interested in a more affordable car. It has free maintenance and a long warranty. Very good lease deal and it works very well. Does it make me forget my Porsche, no, but on most days it is more than I could hope for. Not bad gas mileage, over 28 on the highway at 70mph."
car_2680,Ratings on Z4 should be much higher!,"I have driven many sports cars & I must say when comparing apple for apple this is by far the best in handling without sacrificing comfort.  I drove my Z4 from New York to Florida (1200 miles) straight through with no discomfort & I am 63 years old.  To sum it up, my Z4 is great in all category's.  My next car will again be a Z4."
car_2681,What's not to love?,"I had the Z3.  This car is a vast improvement.  Hugs the road & corners much better.  Smoother ride.  Many luxury features the Z3 didn't have, such as rear glass window, auto top without anything to hook or unhook, xenon headlights, run-flat tires freeing up trunk space, roomier interior with new retro design, great cup holders!  Better stereo sound than the Z3 too."
car_2682,A BMW that should not be called BMW!!,"I am leasing this car right now. I love it except for one thing .. The dealership had more than me for the past year. Why? The reliability has been very very poor to the point where I have to take it to dealership every month! Stereo going bad, top leaking, noise from door, trunk leaking. Sadly the quality I am used to from BMW is not present here. It is fun to drive if it was not for all things going wrong with it!"
car_2683,What is missing?,"I've owned a number of sports cars including two Miatas and an RX-8.  This is my first BMW since my '88 535is and it doesn't disappoint.  It's performance is on par with more expensive cars, e.g., Boxster, but it is far less problematic and easier to live with in daily driving. It is comfortable, well-made, has a decent trunk and will run with like cars when asked to do so."
car_2684,Amazing Eye Catcher,"Catches eyes at every stop light. Drives like a dream. Comfortable for shorter people, taller passengers may feel cramped. More trunk space than you would imagine for such a small car. Great car to drive on long trips."
car_2685,This car rocks!,"My previous vehicle was an Audi TT.  A great car that I absolutely loved.  Once the warranty expired it was time for replacement.  Decided on the Z4 3.0 manual.  Car rules.  I drove the 2.5 and I would call the acceleration spirited.  The 3.0 rips.  BMW has got the sound just right with a nice intake rumble and good pop from those chrome tips.  The 6 speed gives nice shifts, although it feels a little notchy.  You have to make sure you hit them just right.  The top is if not the, one of the easiest to use on the market.  No latches, fast, and no clumsy boot to take out of the trunk.  A great car that I would reccomend to anyone interested in this type of vehicle."
car_2686,For the  money,"A  land  shark,  one that  can   take a corner like  a formula one car and  can   go 0-60 in under  6 seconds. The power curve  is  very  steady all the way  up   past 120 mph with  push you  back in the seat feel  almost all the way.The power top works flawlessly as   does just  about  everything else  on  the  car, and the car looks  so  much  better with  the  top  dowwn. So whats not  to  like?"
car_2687,INCREDIBLE,amazing! the bmz z4 has to be the best sports car made it comfortable and fun... and on top all that everywhere i drive it people stare and compliment me
car_2688,smooth,"Great car,very happy with the 2.5 engine.  I still look at the 350z and wonder if I should have gone with that one. Car is major fun to drive, very tight and feels very safe. I regret that i didn't get the fog lights.  I wouldn't waste my money on the navigation system. Just ""keep your eyes on the road and head upon the wheels"""
car_2689,"Z-1 ,,,,,,4 me!","This vehicle has reopened my love of driving.  It is fun, responsive, reliable and gets great mileage for a car in this class.   I would recommend it to those who seek a ""sports car"" extraordinaire!"
car_2690,Speechless,"Well don't buy it if you dont like people to stare at you and to have random people start talking to you. Comfortable interior easy opening of roof, big trunk both men and woman of all ages enjoy."
car_2691,My Roadster,"I drive all day as part of my business and this car is making it a pleasure.  I love the purring noises and the wind rush.  I have had only positive comments from other drivers about the looks.  Even with the price of gas, I cannot stay home for long without wanting to drive off for awhile."
car_2692,Chuck Levine,Have owned several Corvettes. This car is much more enjoyable to drive. It is truly a real sports car. The transmission is great as it allows you automatic or go through the gears without a clutch.
car_2693,I bought a Machine,I was attracted to the Z4 because of the exterior design.  I didn't realize that I was buying not just another pretty car but a machine. I think the car performs best when driving at 90 mph and above.  Handles wonderfully and clean.  It's the best purchase I've made in a long time.
car_2694,A Classic Roadster,"The Z4 is a throwback to the classic roadster like the 60's vettes except it has all the luxuries you could want... glass rear windshield, cd player and so on... the only drawback is the sometimes rough feel of the stiff frame... but this only adds to the classic roadster concept. The sport model with the sport button really kicks it up a notch and aids high speed handling on twisting roads. I would recommend a built in radar detector that allows you to really have worry free fun. This car will put a perpetual smile on your face... p.s. i'm 6'2"" and have plenty of room and I really can fit 2 sets of golf clubs in the trunk... no other roadster can fit one set... I tested them all!"
car_2695,I Love My Baby,"This car rocks!  My husband bought it for me for our 20th wedding anniversary.  What a present, what a man!!  I love my car.  It feels like going on vacation everytime I go anywhere in my car.  I drove Jonas's Ridge (in North Carolina) over the 4th and it was awesome!!!!  The car handles like a dream in the curves.  It truly is a driving experience."
car_2696,A fun roadster to drive,We have SMG transmission on our Z4. That option gives us more fun than with a traditional manual gear system. Bumpy drive on bad road surface but we expected that. A real fun factor in a very sporty drive.
car_2697,Z4 Addicted,"This is my 3rd Z4, and I had two Z3's before that.  This is an amazing automobile.  I took a detour and had a Porsche 911 for a few months.  But its top was finicky, and didn't always like to come back up when it was down.  So I returned to my BMW, which is sooo much fun to drive and great looking too."
car_2698,Z 4  FLORIDA FUN,Great fun to drive.  Wind noise at highway speed could be improved. They also need to find a way to improve the amount of wind in the cabin at highway speed. Car looks great both inside and outside and trunk is surprisingly roomy. With a little work you can get 2 sets of golf clubs in the trunk.
car_2699,Best overall sportscar,"The power is more than adequate with excellent low end torque. The engine is the most refined in any sportscar. Transmission is excellent with well defined gates. Clutch take up and feel is excellent. Steering tightens up beautifuly at speed. Corner placement is intuitive with no corrections necessary in steering feed. Run flat tires provide safety, consistent feedback due to very low flex, rim protection in potholes and excellent convertible trunk space. Interior is excellent in design amd materials. Excellent rear visibility with top up. Solid roll bars. Exceptional sound system even with top down at high speed. Minimal wind buffeting and noise at high speed. Excellent 2 stage skid control"
car_2700,Bad rap on design,"This car has been nothing but an eye catching delight. I believe there has been a conspiracy by BMW haters towards the styling. There is hardly a day I take this car out that I don't get a positive comment,ie. ""nice car""; ""nice ride""; ""I love your car"". I have never received more positive comments on anything I have ever had; except my wife!"
car_2701,Best Value,"This car has the quickest top retraction in the industry: 7 seconds! It handles well, comfortable (except when the top is up and you get out of the car. But overall, a great value and a sexy ride. The only design change I would do is revise the back of the car like the Z8."
car_2702,"Z 4,  3.0  Alpine white/sports package","The car was a total blast.  Love the cockpit...interior layout was excellent.  Felt as if I was flying.  Never got so many stares.  Love the long hood, reminded me of the old jag XKE's."
car_2703,excessive noise,"I actually bought this as ""Mother's Day Gift"" for my wife last year.  She actually gets to drive it once in a while.   The only complaint I have is the excessive noise that comes from from the passenger seat when my wife is riding with me.  ""Are you crazy?""  ""Slow down!"" ""I am NEVER riding with you again in this car!!"" often can be heard even over the sound of the engine as I shift through the five gears.  My only regret now is that I did not buy the 3.0 for a little boost."
car_2704,Why all the negative press?,"Actually purchased June 2003, factory order. This is a great car, provided that you spring for the bigger engine. Love the Sport Package, power top, kickin' stereo, gearbox. The ride can be stiff due to the run-flats but Sport Mode eliminates some of the bobbing. Stylish, fast, gets lots of attention. Clutch catches too high. Drive fast to reveal its true sports car personality."
car_2705,I LOVE THIS CAR!,"FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN... what more can I say? Almost bought the Z3 years ago and waited until the  Z4 came out with the solid back windshield. I drive it year round in snow with studded tires. Out performs my truck in the snow. CAUTION... do NOT buy this car if you like to blend it!! IT IS A CROWD stopper!! My face is sore after driving this car. Reason? The sappy smile from having so much fun!!! I might be a little old lady but I am definitely not from Pasadena. This car seems to appeal to everyone, from little kids to people in their 50's and 60's. The car should have a license that says ""It's all about me"" as it really grabs the attention."
car_2706,bios review,"Fun, fast, my golf clubs fit in, good at highway speed and the shifter is like butter. It's a BMW not a toy, also easier on my body than some other sport cars I have had."
car_2707,The return of the authentic roadster,"Three litre six speed goes like stink. Gear ratio is superb for city and highway use. Excellent ergonomics, simple yet refined. It is the TR6 you had in college without the headaches."
car_2708,Nevada Land Shark,"This roadster is truly a cut above.  It slices through the air and over the road with the ease and precision of a Great White.  As it passes, men and women of discerning taste stand in awe as do the young turks who know good machines.  The well-crafted, roomy  interior is a plus.  It jumps to highway speed like it's glued to the road, and it makes you smile going through corners.  I intentionally forget to buy all the stuff I was sent to the store for so I can make a second trip...via the curvy road to Lake Tahoe and back."
car_2709,I love this car!,This car is so much fun to drive. I love the way it handles!
car_2710,I love my Z4,I have a 2004 BMW Z4 2.5 I bought it just before the 2005 model came out. I have always driven sports cars and the Z4 is the best car I've ever had. It is very fun to drive. It is a little heavy for such a small car weighing in at 3200 lbs. Yet it really has a pop to it when you punch it. The car also looks GREAT. you can't beat the look of the Land Shark :-)
car_2711,Z4 roadster,"Although this is by far the best car I've ever owned, there are a few kinks... The driver's side cup holder is not in the best place. Not exactly maintenance free.  High gas guzzler on street driving.  Even with wind blocker, there is still a high draft.  The number of accessories for the car is great. I've had to dye my leather seat 3 times since i bought the car 9 months ago."
car_2712,The Greatest Car,"This car is awesome. The quality, design, comfort, and performance are excellent. I love this car."
car_2713,Sweet little car!,"Bought it used with 19,000 miles [now has 47,000]. Has been great on gas mileage, about 23-24 MPG. It must have highest octane or it coughs alot! Back window seems fragile; scratched despite putting a towel in the fold when I open the top. BIG problem however with the radio code; replaced battery, and radio locked. Got code from BMW dealer; have never been able to reset and get radio/CD to work, despite following all instructions. Also door metal seems fragile; gets tiny dents so easily that I now park far away from other cars. Glove compartment is badly designed; stuff falls down and out when opened, no edge on it. Otherwise good looker with great performance! So fun with top down!"
car_2714,Not quite a sports car,"My Z3 runs great and has been very reliable, BUT when the finish peeled off the wheels BMW told me the warranty only covers if the wheels don't go round. The seats move forward and back as I speed up or slow down.  I did have an Austin Healy in the 60s and this car does not measure up.  The shifter gating is vague, the seats are not comfortable for any distance (I guess that is why I never need to worry about fuel range), the interior fittings are always falling apart.  Even the logo washes off of the emblems.  When I have to wait SIX WEEKS for a ABS sensor that I cannot drive without I am not happy.  I can get parts for My TR8 quicker and that is more fun to drive."
car_2715,Finally bought one,"We finally bought of these retro-looking beauties. The price tag was just too high originally but we found a nice ultra-low mileage model for half the original list. This 3.0 liter steptronic is everything it is said to be. Just excellent performance, especially the handling. It didn't hurt that we bought some new Goodyear F1 all-season tires. The interior is just classic w/everything laid out quite well. The gas mileage is OK, not great, but 225 HP will do that. Comparing this car with a Miata is a joke. No way! Maybe because they are both roadsters I guess. The Z3 is more in the Boxster or Audi TT class. Grab a Z3 before the low mileage ones are all gone! The Z4 changed too much."
car_2716,I love my Z3,I bought a 2002 BMW Z3 2.5i 3 days ago and this is the most fun I have ever had in a car.  I am 22 years old and I am having 50 year old guys telling me that I have a nice car.  Tell that isn't a good feeling when everybody wants the car you are driving.
car_2717,Z3 - 2002 3.0L,This is the most legal fun you can have!  The only complaint I have is about the HORRIBLE Harman-Kardon speakers... I have heard better in a VW Beetle.  There is no excuse for BMW to use this poor quality.  It is one of those things you understand that you will just HAVE to replace.
car_2718,Total blast!,"This is my 3rd BMW (325 '96, 528i '99). It's a total blast to drive! I loved the 528i handling (which reviews made the best production sedan ever), but the Z3 must use some technology that flat-out reads my mind. I mean, the handling is just telepathic. I caught myself changing lane in for sure less than 0.1 second at 80 mph (typical on a non-jammed CA highway) by a slight movement of the steering wheel. This car means business. It goes where you want it to go, and DSC keeps the the oversteer in check (the Z3 *will* oversteer when pushed agressively with DSC disabled) It jas the looks, the handling, and the 'cachet', and IMHO, no other roadster (Z4 included)  matches its sleek styling."
car_2719,Fun to Drive and Attention Grabbing,"Bought this roadster new and it has 
been a thirill to own.  Great handing 
if you can find a curvy, open road.  
The gearing is very low, even in 5th 
gear, so there's always plenty of 
torque without downshifting.

Brakes and steering are first class

Lots of strangers admire it."
car_2720,RRZ3,"I've loaded mine up with the Dinan 
upgrades and it runs like a dream"
car_2721,The Austin Healy with Performance Power,"The M Roadster is definately not a Z3 when it 
comes to handling and performance. It 
challenges the Z 8 for king of the true sports 
cars under 150K.

It is the car for those who owned or wished 
they owned the big Austin Healy of the '60s, 
but with the difference of greater reliability, 
better handling, and much greater acceleration 
and top end. This is the car for twisting roads 
and long road trips."
car_2722,SWEEEEET!!!!!!!,"I really can't say much bad about the 
car...I love the looks and the 
aggressive style. The 3.0 is the way 
to go. Everyone who is an enthusiast 
wants the 3.0 over the 2.5 The motor 
is great, tranny superb, and the 
handling is out of sight. I have 
noticed fairly quick wear on the 
tires. But, I do drive it with 
authority..If you can find one in good 
shape get it..The car is gonna be a 
classic!!!!!"
car_2723,I really like this car!,"I really, I mean REALLY like htis 
car!  It is a drivers machine.  It 
does everything you ask of it and 
more.  It's FAST (expecially after 
getting it chipped = then it's REALLY 
REEAALLLY fast) It corners like a 
dream.  Gas mileage has been 
outstanding - on a recent trip to Las 
Vegas at an average speed of let's 
just say 90+ I got 24.5mpg.  Contrary 
to the review above I think it is one 
of the greatest looking cars around.  
It has hints of some of the most 
classic sports cars of all time 
throughout its integrated styling 
scheme.  As for comfort, I can drive 
the car comfortably longer than the 
capacity of my bladder and gas tank."
car_2724,So far soooo good,"After hearing less than steller 
reviews of BMW reliability - we bought 
the Z3 with some caution. However, the 
car has been just great. It is 
impossible not to have a grin on your 
face when you're driving. It is just a 
blast. I short drive in the Z3 can 
transform a bad day into a vacation."
car_2725,The best!,"This is my 3rd bimmer and, even though 
I loved the other two ('94 325is 
and '96 325iC), this is the best!  
This is what I wanted when I bought 
the 325iC - glad I waited until the Z3 
came equipped with the 3.0!  What a 
blast to drive and quite the head 
turner.  I think I will hold on to 
this one for a while as I am not too 
impressed with the Z4's styling."
car_2726,UGLY Car but Fast as Hell!,"This car was extremely fast; however, 
it was one of the ugliest car's I have 
ever seen!!"
car_2727,I Love My New Car,"Besides the Manual shift, the car is 
attractive fun to drive and makes me 
looks very professional and prosperous."
car_2728,great fun sport car,"this car is not for everybody it is a 
mean fast driving machine. the cockpit 
is cozy it is full with two people. it 
is geared for performance I dont sugest 
driving long distances.  I have to get 
out to streach every hour or so. I 
raced a 94 corvete up a mountain and 
easly out handeled the vette. tight 
turns are a favorite you can throw it 
around and it keeps coming back for 
more. the DSC it a real life saver it 
only comes into play when I am driving 
at the edge I am scared to drive this 
car very fast without the DSC 
inguaged.  if you want a fun driving 
machine I highly recomend this car.  
thanks for reading this rob"
car_2729,Fun little car,"This is a fun little car.
Minimalist's dream car.
Raw at its best.
Watch out. Cops gonna get you.
already got a ticket after 2 weeks."
car_2730,need for speed,"This cars fulfills the need I used to 
get filled by driving motorcycles. I 
love this machine and I never will get 
tired of its snappy response and sexy 
looks. Women love this little stud and 
men can't help but try to keep up no 
matter what they are driving. I have 
never seen a car that inspires so many 
looks and challenges. I love it."

130 MILES. LOVED TO DRIVE CNVERTIBLE ON 
THE RAIN...TRY IT SOME TIME!"
car_2732,love to drive,"I love this car.  The first time I test 
drove this car I new it was the one.  I 
will never buy another Japanes car.  
The tork is awsome and the handeling is 
cool.  I can say I enjoy driving to 
work now."
car_2733,mine,"In one word ""GREAT"""
car_2734,Best car I've ever owned!,"My husband and I have always purchased 
GM vehicles in the past, but after 
owning our BMW and being so pleased 
with everything from the dealership to 
the overall performance and styling. 
We'll most likely never own another GM 
product. Every GM car I've owned the 
vehicle had a recurring problem that 
the dealerships (note plural: 
dealerships) could not fix. 
Frustrating!!! Anyway, we love our BMW 
and will purchase another for my 
husband to drive!!!"
car_2735,First Impressions,"Bought mine yesterday after looking 
for a month. Gorgeous shape and 
excellent ride.  Power of 3.0 worth it 
over 2.5. Definitely looking forward 
to having some serious fun with this 
car."
car_2736,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"I bought my Z-3 3.0 (sport package) a 
couple of months ago and I love it. I 
am a dyed-in-the-wool BMW owner with 
this being the 7th that I've owned. 
This car is fast, sporty, gets lots of 
looks and positive comments and 
blasting around on backroads and even 
around town is a great deal of fun. 
Ride is good, handling is solid and the 
engine and transmission (manual) are an 
absolute joy. It runs great and handles 
very well indeed. If I had know it 
would be this much fun I would have 
bought one long ago. Just wish it was 
cooler in Phoenix! I fit fine in it and 
I'm 6'1"" and 230 pounds."
car_2737,Very satisfied customer,"Awesome looking car that really turns 
heads. I'm glad I got the 3.0 liter 
because I wouldn't want anything 
slower. It's not real fast but at least 
I won't kill myself. The front and rear 
driver side, driving lights went out 
after about 350 miles of use. I paid a 
$995 for a factory 6 CD Changer which 
is ridiculous but I wanted everything 
to be stock. I was quite surprised that 
the oil only needs to be changed every 
15,000 miles. All the maintenance is 
included for 3 years at no cost as well.
Mine has a beige interior and I wanted 
a black interior at first, but people 
warned me about how the hot seats would 
get since it's a convertible."
car_2738,A topless wonder!!,"Bought it used with 3800 miles on it.  
Has been used for 1 1/2 yrs with total 
enjoyment.  I love this car and keep it 
garaged and cleaned off after every 
use.  It now has 18000 miles and is 
still as good as new, a real dream car."
car_2739,The Most Fun Roadster Yet,"This car is amazing! I bought the 2.5
with about every option which brought
the price up to 36K, but it was worth
every penny. The steptronic automatic
transmission is very smooth in normal
mode, and acts like a manual when in
sport mode. The cornering is great and
the ride is very smooth for a smaller
car. As you ride the curvy mountain
roads, you want to push it to the max.
This roadster is more fun to drive than
any I have had."
car_2740,A Bang for your Bucks,"It is the best sports convertible for 
your money. I test drove and priced 
S2000, Boxster, Miata, SLK, MR2, and 
Spyder. This car rates #1 in my $/
(fun*performance) index. I got a great 
deal at $25,800; a basic model with no 
option in classic red/black color 
scheme. Great performance; good torque 
at any rpm."
car_2741,It should be in the sports car category,"Althought, it is luxurious, I would 
classify it under sports convertible 
category. In everyday street driving, I 
think it outperforms Boxsters due to 
its good low-end torque. It is more fun 
to drive. I just can't get use to 
Boxster's hydralic clutch. It's 3 times 
better than the weak MR2 Spyder or the 
S2000."
car_2742,"An economical, yet sporty roadster","Bought used, I got a great deal on my 2000 2.3 Z3.  On sunny days there is nothing like this great performing car, especially on winding 2-lane roads.  It accelerates, brakes, and handles like sporting cars twice its price.  The interior is very roomy and comfortable, and its ergonomics are second to none.  Everyone should have a Z3 in their garage."
car_2743,Tutonic toy,"well handling this, car is planted! Go-cart response. Fun to drive, a joy on twisty roads. Top up or top down a real hoot."
car_2744,Z3 Evaluation,I have found the Z3 to be a wonderfully fun car to drive. Don't park it drive it
car_2745,Still one of the best roadsters,"Love this car. It corners so flatly that it almost begs you to take it around corners even faster. The straight-six is ultra smooth, and strikes a good balance between low-end power and a willingness to rev. 
Reliability has been excellent, and build quality is pretty good (BMW's are good, but Japanese cars still have the best fit and finish). I rated gas mileage as average, but I think that's probably because I never let off the gas pedal : )"
car_2746,roadster in Germany,Wonderful car!  Bought it direct from BMW and saved quite a bit.  Love the looks it gets and it's very quiet at speed.  I sometimes forget it's a convertible because it's so well insulated; can't wait for Spring to get here!
car_2747,BMW sales guy,"I am a former BMW salesman. This vehicle was probably the hardest vehicle to sell without a test drive I believe because of the looks (which I savor). Once driving the car, you will be hooked as I was. I can tell you that of all the vehicles BMW has this one and the X5 4.8 are the most fun to drive, hands down. Usually if you wait right before summer they will drop the lease rates and you can get into one for a decent monthly payment. BTW this thing isn't as great on gas as suggested, especially when you drive it like it should be driven, fast. And I am 6 ft. tall, so it isn't perfect for me, but it's not bad. BTW the Auto/ 5 speed steptronic is really fun and much more practical for SOCAL."
car_2748,My  Z4,"Fun in warm weather, not so up North, tight fit for taller drivers"
car_2749,BMW Z4,First sports car owned in 30 years.  Put the fun back in driving. Handles and corners well.  Good acceleration off the line.  Mine is a 2.5 model and I never drove the 3.0 model but I think it would benefit from the extra power.  No downsides on the car.  Interior better in this than Boxster (until 2005 model).  Fast enough for my kind of driving (64 years old).  Glad I bought it.
car_2750,Must Read,"Have had this car a year. a great car fun to drive and lots of room. Have had other makes but this is by for the best. If anything goes wrong, BMW stands behind their car. And not everyone has a car like yours and I like that. I don't want a car that everyone has. Fun car for a man and wife, they can take to the road and talk and have fun. It is the best thing that my hubby and I ever did was buy this car it has a great radio but we never use it. We love to get in the car and ride and talk. We have been married 25 years and kids are grown and this car gave us a way to get out and have fun and talk and see things that we never seen in a car that the top is on all that time. It is a must have."
car_2751,Z4,"Great handling, comfort ride, this is one of the few unique looking cars on the road.  Most other convertibles all look a like.  I like that this one is very distinctive in looks."
car_2752,It's a Blast!,"It's a wonderful driver's car that 
doesn't ask for many compromises.  For 
a small two seater, leg room is ample 
and a golf bag plus hand cart fit 
easily into the trunk, even with the 
top down!  The car's road manners are 
outstanding and the chassis is 
wonderfully stiff for a ragtop.  I 
definitely recommend stepping up to the 
3.0 engine and 6spd.  I'm told that the 
2.5 and 5spd can seem winded at highway 
speeds.  Definitely not the case with 
the 3.0/6spd.  The looks inside and out 
are controversial, but they continue to 
grow on me.  Quality to this point has 
been very good."
car_2753,excellent car,"Since buying my  Z4 in Sept. ( it's a 
2004), I've put on 3000 very fun miles. Plenty 
of power and lot's of compliments on the car. 
The only problem was the auto-darken rear 
view mirror failed and had to be replaced."
car_2754,Z car 4 you.......,"There is not a bad day when I drive my 
Z4 roadster.  From the time I put it 
on, until I slide out of it,,,it is 
sheer happiness and performance.  It 
thinks, compensates, makes beautiful 
hmusic and can store enough for a 
vacation for 2!.  It handles like a 
dream, holds the road like it is 
attached. I love it's unique lines and 
styling."
car_2755,excellent and fun to drve,"The most fun to drive roadster I've ever
had. I've owned a Miata and a Mitsubishi
3000 And the Z4 is above those three in
every aspect of performance and fun, not
to mention reliability."
car_2756,Suntan machine !,"My first BMW's convertible was a Z3 back in 1997. The Z4 is ""totally"" a difference experience. It drives very well on side streets and Freeways and it is very fast. It's the prefect car to cruise the roads Southern California."

Only problem this year is that I have 
NO ALARM system.  I had to order it as 
an ""accessory"" and BMW ""forgot"" to wire 
for it, so I am without an alarm system 
at present.  Don't know how long I have 
to wait for this ""part""."
car_2762,Captivating design,"This is as pretty a car as one could ever hope to own. The exterior lines are great and the interior is beautiful. It is fun to drive and a pleasure to just look at. The fit is perfect for all body parts and both the soft and hard tops. If you are considering a Z8, be sure you get all the original accessories. You might also ask that the Performance Kit be installed. Reputable dealers would know the part and understand why you would want it.Update 08/2017: Still loving this car. Entered it in a car show in Carmel last week. Other cars included five Ferraris and several Porsches including a 911-50. Our Z8 won Best in Show. It was the most admired car on the street."
car_2763,Red Hot Fun,"One of the first off the production line.  A silver was firmly in my mind,however when I saw the hot red color on this baby with a black interior, I knew this was my car!  No where can you drive without turning heads.  From young coeds, males in  hot rods to interested observers at the gas pump, it demands attention but does not require frequent stops.  Sports car feel, vintage hints to design from the past mixed with the latest technology and mechanics, this car runs! Sit in the drives seat and feel engulfed in a peice of history and the future.  Comfortable, with the brute power (almost 400hp) to get the adrenaline surging.  Exotic sports car ownership with minimal maintenance.  The Z-8!"

sensational design to its exhilerating

car_2767,The Z8 is Not Enough,"This car is awesome.  It is truly a 
drivable work of art with performance 
that is almost scary. The Z8 is the 
best looking car on the road today and 
at 0-60 in about 4.5 seconds, a car 
that will blow away nearly everyone 
else off the road.  And while this car 
is a dream to drive, it is not 
perfect.  The radio/navigation system 
is too complex.  There is a lot of 
plastic on and in the car (but it looks 
great).  Sure, the speedo and tach are 
at the center of the dash....and it 
takes a little getting used to.  But 
once you do, this quirk only adds to 
its uniqueness."

car_2786,Solid Replacement for the A4 Wagon,"Picking up an allroad slightly used was the only way we could find to replace our beloved 2007 A4 wagon.  We still have the wagon but since it has 146,000 miles we decided to ""leave"" the wagon to our daughter.  It's a great replacement and is performing well.  The 8-speed transmission is butter (no, I did not mean better)."
car_2787,Great mover,"Bought this car to replace a 2002 S6 because my wife really likes wagons. Moved our daughter from Humboldt over the weekend driving 14 hours straight. The wagon swallowed a ton on accumulated stuff, handled the twists and turns of highway 101 like a sports car and was a very comfortable cruiser on Interstate 5. The engine had plenty of power for passing but I had to use the paddle shifters because in drive mode the transmission kept the higher gear too long which made for a jerky  ride when you were trying to shoot the gaps. The sport mode shifted sooner but I didn't want to pay the gas penalty.Overall it is a comfortable cruiser and 14 hours behind the wheel was not an issue. I highly recommend this car."
car_2788,All Road is Not All That,"Let's start by saying this car (type) is the ideal car for me. Space for cargo--although not as much as one would think--car-like handling and great style. Audi builds great looking cars. My issues are with maintenance and driving performance. MAINTENANCE: had to replace tires, rotors and brake pads at 20,000 miles. Have a mystery rattle that was never found so the premium Audi came in handy to drown it out. Great sound system. DRIVING CHARACTER: Coming from an Avante, the driving characteristics of the All Road are not as refined or sporty. Little more body roll in corners and some squirlyness on imperfect roads. I would advise not buying with the upgraded 19"" wheels as they render the car useless in snow or conditions where Quattro will be functionally useful. Look good but compromise ride quality. Ask the 8-speed dual-cutch transmission is clunky at low speeds. Finally, Audi decontented the cars packaging from the avant. Many of the handy cubbies and drawers were taken away in this iteration of their wagon class. Ironic, considering it's positioned as an activity vehicle. THE GOOD: The car does accelerate nicely when asked to and the fit and finish is really good. Cabin noise is very quiet. Looks great, alright the front end styling is a bit soft. Subjective. I'm stepping out of my All Road into the new Golf Soortwagon after looking at the BMW wagon--very pricey--the Volvo V60--no paddles on the R Design AWD--and stellar reviews on the Golf. It's good all around, sans AWD, and is a great value."

car_2791,All around excellent vehicle,"I've had this vehicle for almost two years now and it's been a very fun vehicle to drive!! I have the Prestige version and it's fully loaded with blind spot monitor, rain sensing wipers, upgraded stereo. What I love most about it: Bang and Olufsen stereo..really sounds great, panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, power liftgate.What I don't like about it: seats aren't the most comfortable, and the rear seat leg room. Also the options can be $$$ when you move up in trim levels.Other than that, the Allroad is very fun to drive!Update: I sold this vehicle recently because minor problems kept happening and I was tired of taking it into the dealership.  The dealership near me is always busy and it's hard to take my car in for a quick fix.   The bluetooth connection with my phone was always slow taking at least 5 minutes to connect and I had to wait for everything to ""initialize"" (including the radio).  The best thing about this car was the handling and power."

car_2796,Totally Fun Driving,"I am a big man at 6'3"" and 260 lb with arthritis and that is why I am letting this car go.  It is very difficult for me getting in/out of the very low seats with the top up.  Once I am in it is reasonably comfortable around town but again on  a long drive leg cramps became an issue.  I have loved owning and driving this car though because once I am in the seat I feel in total control of the driving experience.  The car has exceptional performance if you use the gears correctly and can easily get to 100+ just entering an on ramp.  Brakes are superb (typical BMW) and the six speed tranny shifts flawlessly and seems to know your exact movement when shifting.  I have never missed a shift.  I have changed the oil per the factory recommendation and the battery a couple of times.  There have been no other problems other than a flat tire.  I replaced the run flats with a performance tire that can be repaired and love the way they hold the road as well as improving the ride.  The only drawback to these tires is that I do not have a spare.  Oh well....."
car_2797,3.0i Sport Package - dream car!,"I am still in shock after I purchased the 2006 Z4 3.0i fully loaded with winter, comfort and sport packages for around $20,000 with 50k miles on it.I simply would have to search for a reason why buy anything else - including new, newer, or different model sport cars.With a push of a button this thing performs as if it had turbo or supercharged engine.The interior, though not Jaguar comfortable, hugs you tightly and holds you in one place to enjoy the show.Super tight sport suspension can take almost any corner at mind boggling speeds you can throw at it.Ditch the ""run-flat"" tires.Buy whatever you want at Tirerack.com for less than $500 and your car's shoes are back in order."
car_2798,Dream Car,I have owned this car since October 2009.  Bought it used with 36k.  When I purchased it the channel changer on the stereo was not working.  It was still under warranty.  The dealership replaced the stereo with a new one.  Other minor issues including front brake rotors occurred and the BMW dealership took care of them all at NO CHARGE.  The warranty is the best.  The car handles like a dream.  It certainly is a head turner.  I had a minor accident because of a blind spot when you look back to back up .  I love this car.  It handles like a dream and the dual steptronic transmission is terrific.  I am a BMW customer for life.  The customer support and service is the best I have dealt with.
car_2799,Fun -- Fun -- Fun -- in the Sun,"Bought the car with 17,000 miles. The car is amazing to look at, never mind amazing to drive. Fast, confident and gorgeous come to mind. Or as a friend said after riding in the car, ""I couldn't stop smiling""! The interior is comfortable and well laid-out. The MPG is incredible -- I'm averaging 28-28 MPG (low of 25, high of 32.2). I did replace the OEM run-flat tires with regular tires and the ride quality improved 100% with no loss of handling and improved wet road handling. My car is still under warranty and the few issues that needed to be fixed where taken care of by the dealer no problem, even though I'm the 2nd owner. Drawbacks: it is a little challenging to get in and out of!"
car_2800,Fun car to drive!,"Bought the car with 19K mi., after driving 13k mi. I only have good things to say about the Z4.  The sport suspension is incredible, you feel connected to the road, cornering is superb, it may be a little stiff for some drivers but keep in mind this is a sports vehicle.  The 3.0si engine meets and exceeds expectations.  255 hp for a 3,000 lb vehicle makes for speedy acceleration, the transmission sport mode makes the responsiveness that much better.  The instruments, stereo and GPS are up to par with other high end convertibles.  Even the trunk is of decent size compared to other convertibles available, enough for a weekend trip for two!"
car_2801,One is not enough,"I bought my first Z4 in the spring of 2009. My wife and I argued as to who would drive it, so I bought another last fall. No doubt, fun to drive, scary quick, and either a head turner. BMW's reputation for service is second to none. I agree with many people here. If you want to get happy quick, go start and drive a Z4!"
car_2802,Nice but not for me,"I bought this Z4 two years ago and only drive it 6000 miles a year.  The seats are uncomfortable despite their quality, and the shifter/armrest arrangement causes one to slurp to the right while driving- ends up uncomfortable.  Vision is not good on Left.  Wonderful car, so very beautiful, but harsh on the highway with run flats.  Runs like the wind, hits 100 right away.  Chippy in the tracks on the interstate, enormous blind spot, not easy to back up.  Just not comfortable enough for a daily driver or frequent driver.  Reliability superb, but I have to crawl out of it. When I saw it, I simply had to have it, then never drove it much and it just sat in the garage.  Nice, but think twice."
car_2803,Remake this Classic,The BMW Z4 Classic.  Lines are right. The sport edition roars.  I live in Germany and this Classic gets stares all the time--drove her to Paris and they simply stared...
car_2804,Fun in the sun!,"I purchased this black with red leather interior CPO Z4 three months ago with 39k on the odo and the car is as tight as any new car I have owned. I love the looks and the engine is smooth and responsive. Nothing except some prescription medications can change a bad mood into a good mood faster than this car. The stereo sounds awesome top up or down, but could use a changer. I love the way heads turn every where I drive, it is definitely an attention getter. I love the sound of the engine but wish it was a little louder."
car_2805,100% Adrenaline Rush,"I have had my Z4 3.0si for three years and have only put 11500 miles on it.  It is strictly a weekend car. I have a mercedes E350 and Audi A4, but can't wait until the weekend to drive the Z.  I still feel the rush of adrenaline when i press the sports button and rocket down the highway. I feel like a kid driving a go-kart with a big smile on my face. It is just an awesome car!!!"
car_2806,Incredible automobile,"Dreamed of owning one of these for a long time. Finally traded my Jeep Wrangler for this certified used Z4. What an incredible automobile. Handles like a dream and I'm stared at and asked about it 24/7. Handling, fuel economy, and styling is like no other."
car_2807,Great Sports Car!,"We leased our BMW Z4 3.0i to be able to afford it, but not sure we would lease again.  Leasing does get you in the car, but nothing to show for it when the lease runs out.  BMW does make things easy to lease but will find out in August how the transition goes- buy or re-lease something else. Would love to buy it.  Love the car!"
car_2808,Bang for the Buck!,"I had been looking at getting a small sports car for a while.  Looked at the Boxster, Corvette, Audi TT, and the BMW.  I loved the Z4 for the unique design.  Once I drove it, I was hooked.  I paid $30k for this gem.  Silver on Black.  Great for normal day to day, then just push the ""sport"" button and... she becomes a whole new car.  Throttle response, steering and overall power seems to explode!  Its like an alter ego. I drove the M roadster and it is just a Freak!  The 3.0si is a dream for much less. Anyone who complains about the trunk space or the rigid ride should have  chosen otherwise.  Take a shorter trip, pack a smaller bag, and use your buddies truck to go to home depot. Great Car!"
car_2809,Z4 3.0si,"I had my Z3 for twelve years, finally bought a Certified Z4.  Be very careful with Certified, even though BMW has fixed all the problems that have come up, mine has been in the shop for MAJOR suspension and engine problems.  It has been in the shop 20 of the 60 days I have owned it.  Not what I expected from a BMW Certified car.  Now that I think I am past the problems this car had, I really am enjoying driving it!  Much smoother, powerful ride than Z3."
car_2810,3 Years Later,"I ordered this car after seeing it at the Autoshow, even though I was only able to test drive the convertible.  I took delivery of it at the factory, and I have loved it ever since.  I still get a thrill when I see it parked in the lot.  I constantly get 'thumbs ups', wherever I drive it."
car_2811,Fun on wheels,With today's prices it's hard not to consider an upscale model car. The styling is great but the engine and handling is what is special about a Z4. You probably need alternative transportation for the family or pets but a ride in a roadster will always be a treat.
car_2812,Bavarian beauty,"I have only owned this car for 5 months and love it. Previous car was a 1998 Porsche 911, while the Z4 cannot compare to the 911 in performance it comes very close and cost a lot less in purchase price and maint. cost. I also think it is a better looking car. I have gotten more looks and compliments then I did with the 911."
car_2813,Can't Go Wrong With a Bimmer,"Bought this car just a couple months ago with 9,900 miles on it. Always loved the 3 series but fell in love with the Z and I got a good price, too and previous owner paid for all the options [wood dash, power seats/convertible top, HID headlights]. I get looks everywhere I go, and the front styling resembles a 6-series I suppose. Acceleration is best at higher speeds, that's where it really shines. I wish it had more accessible low-end power, but you can't have everything. I average about 25 mpg, but when in traffic that number plummets. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this Bimmer."
car_2814,Makes you feel young!,"This is my first BMW purchase and I am very pleased with the vehicle.  Driving the vehicle  has been a real please.  The driving and steering response is excellent. The miles per gallon 23.5 city and highway has been excellent.  Too bad the vehicle does not use regular gasoline.  The run free tires are a good option.  However, if low tire pressure occurs, the dashboard only indicates low pressure.  It does not tell you what tire is low."
car_2815,Finally a real roadster,"This BMW is finally a testament to BMW's ability to create a driving machine. Roadsters in the present day have become too feminine and superficial. There is no longer a thrill to having a slung-back drop-top  coupe to whip you along coastal roads. But with the Z4, this little machine totes you feel as though you are a part of the road. The power is subtle enough for anyone to use as a daily driver, but for those glorious summer days where all you want to feel is wind whipping through your hair and adrenaline rushing through your veins, this car has the ability to do so. A complete lion draped in sheep's fur. Best combo: heated seats, top down, chilly spring afternoon."
car_2816,Best of the Best!,"I ordered my Z4 for European Delivery and enjoyed my trip to Munich and the new BMW Welt.  The car is absolutely awesome, 6 speed manual tranny has a short throw, well spaced gears and makes the car more like a classic roadster.  With the hardtop up it is a weather tight coupe.  Styling is incredible inside and out.  Sport seats are very comfortable.  Trunk has enough room for a good sized suitcase even with the top down.  This is my 8th BMW and may well be my favorite.  Car gets lots of thumbs up from all ages.  It is the best looking sports car sold in the US under $60K."
car_2817,Best luxury sports car ever,"I traded in a 2005 Z4 and there is no comparison, also own a Miata which is a toy. This car is great for highway driving as well as running around country roads in the sports mode. This car is much more civilized then the much touted Porsche boxter. I could have purchased the Porsche for the same money to me there was no contest. This car is totally redesigned. Wherever i go people stare at this beautiful machine. I love to drive it."
car_2818,They don't make them like this anymore,"This is a fabulous car: exciting to drive, fels great.Just don't expect to get out of the gas station too quickly - people are always coming over to stare and chat. I have had people wave me down on the street to stop so they could photograph it.Awesome car."
car_2819,Hottest car ever built,"This is the hottest car on the road. I traded my porsche turbo for the Z8 and it is far superior. The car will smoke the tires off in 1st gear. It handles like a dream and everywhere I go people love it. The stereo is the best stock stereo I ever heard. It is very clean and clear at all volumes. It has an electric top which is great and a removable hard top. The V8 engine puts out just under 400hp and it feels like more. I recommend this car to any car guy as this is the ultimate sports car for the money. The real deal is behind the wheel - it's like a cross between the old Jaguar XKE V-12 and a Shelby roadster, only this is better. All I can say if you can find one, buy it."
car_2820,BMW Z8,"The retro design is fantastic- The interior leathers are soft and always have that new car smell. The navigation map is small therefore the direction are only arrows and voice, this is ok but I happen to like a map on my nav. system The dashboard is also retro and great looking. The power is awesome for a 4.9L .The sound of the exhaust is low and second to none."
car_2821,impossible to give up,"I think I'll keep this car forever!  I 
am planning on getting a Vanquish and 
every time I drive it to the dealer for 
the trade-in, I turn around."
car_2822,Driver Heaven,"This is a most awesome machine, finely 
tuned, the penultimate BMW 
achievement. Comfortable interior 
belies the power under the hood. Don't 
make the mistake of pushing 
the ""sport"" button unless you're 
prepared for the extraordinary surge 
in power and control ""freedom"" that 
ensues. Don't get this vehicle (if you 
can find one) unless you don't mind 
constant attention and admiring looks 
from bystanders and other drivers."
car_2823,Dream Car,"Recently purchased a used 2001 Z8 with 
less than 300 miles of actual driven 
miles.  I now am looking for a longer 
route to and from work to be able to 
enjoy more driving time."
car_2824,Z Acht,"Benchmark combination of performance 
and styling, with BMW reliability."
car_2825,A sweet year,"Can it be a whole year has past since I 
traded my much loved M3 for the Z8?  I 
still miss the M3 - it was greatly 
loved, but what a replacement.  I've 
found myself in the garage sitting on 
the workbench just staring at the car.  
I couldn't begin to list all the 
comments I've received on the car.  
Then there is the driving experience, 
but frankly, that is to be expected - 
it is the BMW flagship."
car_2826,Two years waiting for this car,"Two years ago I was driving a 07 PRHT Miata.  Test drove a Z4 auto; loved it but couldn't afford it. This spring I traded my Miata Roadster for a 03 Z4 with auto transmission. My wife and I took it on a 4600 mile spring road trip to the northwest all in 10 days. Loved every turn, downshift, and gas stop.  I auto crossed it during the summer months with great pleasure. My brother in law came to town in his pick-up and we found a 05 Z4 for him to take home. Wife and great grand kids were out riding on the week-end in her Mercedes Benz and just stopped to see if the 330ci was the same size has hers. Saw the Z4, could not believe the mileage! Of course I really wanted a 6spd."
car_2827,Awesome Car,"I bought this car because I loved the styling and two years later, I still get excited every time I drive it.   I still get stopped by people asking me questions about it frequently.  I picked this instead of the Porsche Cayman and I've never regretted it."
car_2828,"Sexy, Sleek and Fun to Drive!","When I went to the BMW dealer, I saw this car and fell in love. After the test drive it was an obsession. It handles like it is on rails, it thrills at every turn. It is one hot car and I consistently get 25.5 miles per gallon hwy and city. It is a headturner and it backs up its looks. It is like a motorcycle with a cage around it. It is that ultimate driving experience every time you step into it. It looks as if it chiseled in marble. To me a work of art. Me and this car were made for each other. I recommend it. Great sports car."
car_2829,From a Z-3 To a Z-4,"Well i went from a z-3 to a z-4 miss the curves and the shark gills on the side, but love the power cornering one touch roof and better sound system then the z3.Cup holders in a great spot,not in way of stick shift. Larger trunk,can fit golf clubs and small cooler in this one. They also put a glass window in this one instead of the ole plastic one. Great lighting one the front light up the road also. Owned a 2003 Boxster also at one time and this is less of a money out of pocket kind of car also."
car_2830,My Toy,"I finally bought a 3rd car for our family.  I have always wanted a convertible sports car.  After a lot of test driving and research, we decided to purchase a used 2006 with 8,000 miles on it from the certified lot at our local BMW store.  We have absolutely no regrets!!  I had my heart set on a Porsche Boxster, but after test driving the Z4 I was sold.  We have had it for over a year and it still puts a smile on my face every time I get in.  Strong acceleration, handling, and comfort.  I even drove it 487 miles in one day with the top down and loved every minute of it!!"
car_2831,Zed 4 3.0i,"I bought this car after test driving SLKs, Miatas, Z300s, Boxsters and S2000s.  The Zed 4 3.0i, although not the highest performing Zed 4, seems to be more refined than the other cars I tested.  The handling is crisp and throttle response is quick.  The 3.0i is not particularly quick for this class, but does provide a 0-60 mph time under six seconds.  It is a good highway cruiser but a bit bumpy on the backroads.  However, I never lost any confidence in handling while on bumpy roads.  I'm averaging 24 miles per gallon, driving in both highway and city.  The body style is a real head turner and the interior seems to fit the body style."
car_2832,Quality with Flaws,"Interior build quality is disappointing due to use of cheap plastics.  Been back to the dealer 4 time because of annoying squeaks and rattles but dealer cannot fix.  The high performance driving experience is marred by these constant squeaks and rattles, even happening at low speeds.  Ride is extremely harsh.  On anything other than perfect roads you can feel everything  down to the road paint.  The car is easily pulled from side to side by uneven roads.  Tire noise is high.  Of course this kind of handling is to be expected for this type of car.  Otherwise, the car has exceptional performance."
car_2833,Z4 truly a great car,"I have always been a corvette lover, but the Z4 took my heart away.  Incredible handling, acceleration.  The sport package in my opinion is a must to truly appeciate the driving experience of a Z4."
car_2834,A Year Later--Still WOW,"Ok, my first review was Feb 2007 and at that time I was wowed by this car.  A year later, living in Germany, this car absolutely rocks.  On the autobahn this ragtop can cruise as fast as the others (135mph our top speed so far).  But we prefer to take the top down on a sunny day and slow- drive in the right lane as everyone looks.  It is that hot.  We knew we were coming to europe when we purchased but I can truly say that the Z4 was designed with the autobahn in mind and is super cool to drive.  Its handling is absolutely on point.  It is truly the ""roadster"" it is purported to be.  Hands down, she wins!"
car_2835,As good as it gets for under $50k,"The new 3.0 engine in the si model is incredible. Massive amounts of smooth power, beautiful sound when pushed hard, and a hard to believe 25+ mpg when driven hard. What truly makes the Z4 3.0si great is how well everything works together. The 6-speed manual tranny is perfectly matched to the engines power curve, the brakes have a perfect feel and no fade, the handling with the sport package is race car like."
car_2836,Aw Yeah,"Sold the Cooper S and amped up from 194 hp to 255 on this 3.0si and we definitely appreciate the increased horsepower.  Initially test drove the 3.0 and were quite dissatisfied.  Same engine in the 3.0si as in the 07 335si and it shows.  Sports and Premium pkgs make this car all muscle and well worth going into a ""Roadster"" as opposed to a ""Sedan"" with muscle.  The one touch automatic ragtop is absolutely great because it truly is engineered right--tucks in snug and perfect.  What else would we expect from Bavaria?  Exterior is solid and didn't change in 2007 - so pricewise we scooped up a waiting 2006.  Great move.  Very glad we did."
car_2837,Nothing more fun to drive,"This car is amazing in terms of overall styling and quality.  This model looks like BMW designed the coupe first and then sliced the top off to make the convertible.  There aren't many of the coupes around so if you like to have an unusual car that performs well, this is it.  I've had mine for 7 months and have never seen another one on the road."
car_2838,Great Roadster,"I tested all of the competition (SLK 350, Boxster S, S2000, etc.), and I found the Z4 to be the best in class, especially considering the price.  The Z4 has excellent power (and the sound of the I-6 is like tearing silk!), great fuel economy (averaging 26 mpg+ in mixed driving), tight, buttoned-down handling, plenty of room and great safety features."
car_2839,What a ride!,"I am very critical when it comes to my taste in sports cars.  My Z4 coupe is without a doubt, the best sports car that I have ever owned.  The car does what it is designed to do - be driven!  Some reviews suggest a harsh ride and limited visibility due to the coupe's distinctly low profile.  For a driving enthusiast, these are attributes, not faults.  The build quality is on par with other vehicles in its class, and the smile this thing puts on my face every time I turn the key is priceless."
car_2840,Love my new BMW rag top!,"I am having a blast with this car!  This car has it all, great looks, (Metallic Silver with Red Leather), 6 speed all with 255HP. This car sounds like an F1 race car when it winds up. Great clutch, great gear box and push button top. Gas mileage is about 24 mpg.  I love this car."
car_2841,Fun car,This is a retiree's escape to a driving dream.  It is a fun car.  The optional wind turbulance deflectors allow a newspaper to lie on the passenger seat at 70 mph.  The selectronic 6 speed is very smooth.  The turn radius is sharp.  Handling is tight on turns. A solid runner.
car_2842,This is one great redo,"I previously owned a 2003 Z4 3.0, and now have a 2006 Z4 3.0si. While I loved the first one, the new Z4 is spectacular.  Press the sport button on the si, and it changes the manners completely.  I always felt that I could have used a little more power- but not so much tha I have no choice of transmissions and pay a gas guzzling tax, like the M.  This is that perfect car.  Until the twin turbo from the new 335 makes it over!"
car_2843,Exceptional in everyway,This car has the most road feel of all the cars I test drove.  When I first got behind the wheel of an 05 3.0 I knew this was the car to get in the first ten minutes.  So fun to drive and the quality of workmanship and materials are great.  This car handles like a slot car with nice power.  M-seats are a must.  The stereo is awesome.  I am 6'0 tall and fit comfortably inside.  This is my first BMW and now I know what the buzz is about!
car_2844,Love My Z,"The 2006 Z4 is a great ride! Not only great looking (I get compliments several times a week), but a great drive. It rockets off the line with the 6 speed SMG paddles providing visions of F1 dancing through my head. It eats up curves, I have had it +70 mph on highway exit ramps and is very roomy for a 2 seater.  All that and I use it as my daily driver too. It gets me to and from work, and has even hauled the groceries in a pinch with its very usable trunk space.  Overall it is just plain fun... a practical car that you can race in a pinch, take a nice Sunday drive or go shopping in."
car_2845,Alpine white beauty,"Have had my Z4 for a week now and even with trying to take the car from my wife and constantly arguing about whose car is it, it's still worth every second of owning. After owning my first BMW I don't believe I could ever own another brand."
car_2846,To-Much-Fun,"After 4600 miles, I am thrilled with this car.  It is much more fun to drive than my 2005 C5 vette was, and the interior is quiet enough for conversation with the top down on the interstate.  The engine provides pleanty of power, and I love getting 33.1 MPG on the highway.  The handling is excellent with the sport pacakge and 18"" wheels, but it does try to follow road grooves at lower speeds.  The cabin and trunk are large for this type car, but the standard seats are a bit alcking in support and style.  I wuold get the M seats if buying another one.  This is a great looking car that really turns heads.  This is my daily driver and handles wet weather wonderfully."
car_2847,Got it... love it,"I just climbed out of a 02 toyota mr2 into a new z4. I love the power, the room, the automatic top. I can't get the smile off my face... what a nice change! The z4 is just what I needed. I used to have a 99 corvette and I like this z4 even better than I did the vette and I liked the vette a lot."
car_2848,Control the Power,"BMW z4 3.0si is built for fast car driver.  I drove nissan 350z, honda s2000, Mazdarx8, lexus sc430 but z4 is diffrent. I was in love with car after 1st ride. Got to have that ultimate Driving Machine."
car_2849,"Z4 Coupe 3.0si... so far, so good","I followed this vehicle since the X Coupe Concept unveiling in Jan '01 and loved the look the moment I saw it.   Previously owned a '00 Z3 M Coupe (S52 engine) and would rate the Z4 similarly but with welcome upgrades in chassis stiffness and cabin noise reduction.   I-6 is inherently smooth, mechanically sophisticated, and refined but not sleep-inducing.  Much better than the M3's S54 which I found to be rough, unappealingly raspy, and difficult to drive smoothly in traffic.   Materials quality and fit and finish is fine but doesn't approach VW/Audi.  Great steering feel and response.  Somewhat heavy but appropriate clutch and shifting."
car_2850,The Ultimate Driving Machine,The faster I go the better it holds the road.  The torque is awesome.  I love the paddle shifters on the steering wheel.  The exhaust sound really makes you feel exhilarated.
car_2851,Z4 a Great Drivers Car,Z4 handles great and is lots of fun to drive. After 2300 miles I am very happy with everything except the Run Flat Tires.
car_2852,Only a Step Away,"I like its looks that's why I bought it.  But the gas mileage! Try 14-18 mpg.  Interior really small.  You sit too low.  Love the power top, but why not hard top like the SLK?  Noisy, too.  The ride is a lot more bumpy than it should be for a luxury roadster.  The 3.0i is slower for sure, I wish I had bought the M class after all.  Come on BMW, you cheap bums, for the money we pay, give us free DVD Nav, Sat radio, more goodies and less rear blind spots. Lose the paddles, who needs them?  They look stupid, anyway.  Give us better looking wheels and a leather wrapped better looking steering wheel."
car_2853,3.0 si is the best BMW ever,"The new BMW Z4 3.0si is a huge improvement over the last Z4.  I just traded my 2003 3.0i.   The Sport suspension and 18 inch wheels are fantastic, as is the new engine. Absolutely fantastic-  I am driving with a grin, finding excuses to drive. Great car."
car_2854,First impressions,"Bought a 3.0i after comparing it to the Nissan Z, the Volvo C7, and a few others.  This car is very fun - the interior (beige leather) looks great. The 6-speed manual is smooth.  Haven't encountered any negative items in the 2 weeks I've had it.   Some minor things I think BMW should change, but those are convenience items and don't detract from the overall rating of this car.  I really like it."
car_2855,Making Time for Fun,"I leased my Z4 and I am very happy that I was able to keep my other car. My Z4 is for my pleasure excursions. Since I don't drive it every day, it is always a treat when I lower myself into the driver's seat. The SMG is the best feature. California is full of stop and go traffic so I don't have to deal with a manual transmission until I want to. When I hit the open highway, I really enjoy the ability to shift gears on my own. Not quite the same as having a clutch, but it's the closest thing to the best of both worlds. My car has made me look forward to long weekends.  I'm already looking forward to the end of my lease and the ability to get a Z4 M."
car_2856,Z4,"Don't get me wrong.  I bought it, okay?  But...  the Z4 is fun to drive and stylish, but cramped as hell, hard to get in and out.  Bad gas mileage.  Fast, though"
car_2857,Lots of fun - needs more storage,"I have out about 500 miles on this in two weeks- took it over the mountains to go to court. Lots of curves and twists, and the car hung in there every step. I also own an '06 Boxster that holds the road better but can't complain about this car.  Storage is always a problem in a roadster, but even BMW should have a coin holder/tray of some kind.  Maybe should have gotten the 3.0 si but this car has plenty of power. Love it!"
car_2858,Z4 Coupe - a car to love,"This car is the answer to all those people who wanted a sports car but did not want a convertible. This is a true ""grand tourer"" with usable trunk space in combination with superb handling and performance. The new 3.0 litre engine is powerful with enough torque to make driving in the town/city easy. On top of all this the car is superb to look at. It somehow finishes off the convertible and makes it into a classy good looking car (always a plus when you spend this sort of money). It is comfortable for me (I am 6' 1"" tall) and does not feel crowded in the cabin. Handling is great due to the 50/50 balance and the steering nicely weighted with good road feedback (though not as good as the 5)."
car_2859,Z4 3.0si Roadster... simply amazing,"We ordered our car, chose every option and all colors.  We chose Silver Gray Metallic paint, Gray Top, Aluminum Trim, Heated Dream Red Leather M Sport Seats, Premium Package, Sport Package, Xenons, and a 6-Speed Manual Transmission.  We absolutely love our car and couldn't be happier!"
car_2860,Z4 Coupe -  A True Sports Car from BMW,"When I saw the photos of the Z4 Coupe concept at the Geneva Motor Show, I knew that if its performance lived up to its style, I wanted one.  I've been car shopping on and off for the last couple years -- and seriously since last November.  I've test driven the Boxster, S2000, 350Z, G35 Coupe, RX-8, and even a Mustang GT.  All fine cars, but none of them exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted a fast, nimble, two-seater hardtop sports car that was equally fun when you floored the accelerator as when you took it through the twisties.  The fact that the Z4 Coupe was drop-dead gorgeous sealed the deal.  I've owned it for a month, and I love it.  It's everything I thought it would be."
car_2861,Red Hot and Fun,"I now just turned 1000 miles on this car. The sound of the straight 6 is so sweet. The motor pulls so nicely downshifting is not required to pass. I ordered with the sport supension love the wheels but hate the way the car jumps from rut to rut on the freeway the dealer told me thats caused by the low profile tires. The mileage is great, love the power top passed on the M sports seat way too tight."
car_2862,As good as it gets!,It's hard to explain the joy this car brings. Everything works together perfectly in the Z4 to create one awesome driving experience. BMW has to make some of the best engines I've ever driven. Smooth strong power from any RPM range. The sport suspension mode is incredible!
car_2863,My new BMW  Z4 Roadster,"The Z4 has exceeded my expectations. It is fun to drive and goes where you point it. The quality of workmanship is evident clearly in every respect. It is quiet, with wind noise the largest sound factor. Even the gas mileage is better than I had expected. A small negative is that the display is a bit hard to see in bright daylight with the top down. It is hard to graceful when entering and exiting the car. This is common with roadsters. With the top in place there is a feeling of spaciousness. The trunk is big enough for traveling. Worth the price."
car_2864,Genuine Sports Car,"Just love everything about this car. Beautiful looks, fun to drive, comfortable inside, tremendous service from BMW. Just all around satisfied."
car_2865,"1st 1,000 miles","This car really makes you want to find a longer way home.  It makes it difficult to work, when your mind keeps wandering to the car waiting outside.  Be careful, it is hard to drive anywhere close to the speed limit no matter what kind of roads you are on.  In normal mode the suspension is the perfect balance between comfort and handling (even my wife is comfortable riding in it), sport mode is just WOW!  I am sure that my less than advertised fuel economy is attributable to the fun factor.  This car was designed to go fast, and make you feel good doing it.  I have owned roadsters for the last 30 years and the 2006 Z4 is by far the best one so far."
car_2866,My Baby,"Driving this car is even more exhilarating that I imagined.  The smooth powerful feeling of driving the Z4 reminds me of my earlier days with my old 280Z and 300ZX.  I love the power top which is controllable from either the front panel, the door lock, or externally from the key via blue tooth.  Shifting through the 6 forward gears is a dream.  Beyond my expectations, my golf clubs do fit in the trunk, although I have to carefully arrange them. The run flat tires have already bailed me out of a tight situation -- thanks BMW, great idea."
car_2867,Z4-Great job BMW,Handling is fantastic.  Very responsive in every way.  Interior materials are great.  Very comfy car.  Fit & finish couldn't be better.  We're happy with this car in every possible way.
car_2868,Amazing car,"I absolutely adore my new Z4.  I have never had a car that handles so magnificently and that attracts so many stares.  Whether in heavy traffic or the open road the car is a treat to drive.  The convertible top opens so easily and in less than 10 seconds.  The Z4 accelerates with a flourish and truly ""hugs the road"". What a dream!"
car_2869,super go-cart,"This car is a rocket ship on wheels. I drove the 350Z, Z4 3.0, Miata MX-5, and the s2000 when I was looking for a roadster and none of them could compete with the 3.0si. A well thought out car with a great thrill factor. As much fun as a motorcycle with much more protection. The drivetrain is perfect from all aspects. Kudos to the Germans."
car_2870,My Z4 opinions,"I have only owned my Z4 for a month, but so far it has exceeded my expectations. The workmanship appears to be excellent as is the over the road performance. In short, I am glad I bought it."
car_2871,Unreal!,"I can’t believe this car!  I haven’t had this much fun driving since I was 16. It's beautiful, turns corners like its on rails, and you can definitely getty-up and go with this engine.  Invest in the 3.0si - you won’t regret it."
car_2872,This is THE car for people who like to travel,"Surprising fuel economy on the ?highway, comfortable ride in every condition. If you consider buying one of these you need to have the sport front seats and virtual cockpit."
car_2873,Quirky Ergodynamics,"Handsome car, Excellent Mileage, Great highway cruiser.   Good, not great, in snow with 4 new snow tires.  Ultimately poor ergo dynamics led us to sell the car at 8 months of ownership and 9500 miles.  Getting in and out of the car was difficult without hitting your head or shoulders.  Getting out of the car the back of legs would always hit the door sill trim which sticks out too much.  The gear shifter is different then standard automatics - easy enough to figure out but difficult if going from a different vehicle to this one.  Cupholders are in the worst possible location - under buttons.  Every time a cup is removed or placed in the holder a finger gets scraped.  The MMI (technology) buttons and knob are between the shifter and the cupholders.  One spill on the MMI controls and they are likely to get ruined and replacement costs are not covered by warranty (even the dealer warned us).  The radio volume control knob seems to be in a great place on the console but way too easy to hit with a bag - change the volume, turn off the volume.  The radio display - when a station is changed the display changes to the new station and then mysteriously shows the previous station (does not change the music) for about 10-15 seconds - why would it do that???  Strange click-click from under the car on the first acceleration with each time the car is turned on.  Dealer said it was the anti lock brakes (never heard that in previous cars with antilock brakes).  I wonder if it was the new quattro system."
car_2874,BEST ALLAROUND,"Pricey but well worth while. Car is an amazing combination of luxury, comfort and utility. It make you smile as you go down the road; however, it will NOT accept a trailer hitch even though articles say it does."
car_2875,Amazing Allroad,"This car is a joy to drive.  The composure and sure footedness is impressive at any speed.  Going a wee bit :) over the speed limit, you will not know how fast you are going.  Thank goodness for the head up display on the Prestige trim.  This is a silent and stealth car for those of us who are looking to do some spirited driving and get the children to school.  The quiet cabin is amazing as well.  Enjoying every drive!"
car_2876,Dream car - very satisfied so far,"This car is by far the perfect fusion of performance, practicality and technology. Drive select gives you two different flavor of driving, dynamic being stiffer, comfort being softer, and it was more than capable when traveling through mountains or highways. More space than you possibly imagine, huge cargo, very comfortable second row (don't look, sit on and you know what I am talking about). Length is the same with SUVs like Lexus RX 350, only with lower ride height, giving substantially better driving pleasure. Technology wise I don't know a car better than this except tesla, definitely better than current BMW (2017). Combination of advanced lane assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist almost make this car driveless, removing most of driving pressure, but still in practical level (you have the control instead of the car itself). Luxury interior, fantastic lighting and high quality inlay and leather. Only one complaint is that it is not as sporty and stiff as some of the sport coupe, but I guess I can't put all hope onto the same car:)"
car_2877,Wagons are back!,This is a fabulous car. Enough room to haul my dogs in crates. My 2006 Audi S6 just sits in the garage now. The turbo has no lag and the car is almost as quick and agile as my S6.
car_2878,Z8 dream,"The BMW Z8 is a beautifully proportioned, exceptionally well engineered hand built car. Introduced in 2000 at about $130,000 it has increased in value roughly equivalent to inflation. An excellent low mileage (under 15000 miles) car can be bought in the $180000 range. The blue, black and red versions seem to command a higher price than the much more common silver car. Similarly, the cream interiors and the red/black interiors are more rare and command a higher price. The car itself is a real pleasure to look at as well as to drive. It is fast and it is comfortable. I looked at Lamborghinis too and they are awful to drive (older versions in the same price range as the Z8). Newer Lambos are a great ride. But the Z8 should continue to appreciate in value even though they seem plentiful in the used car market. The lowest price I have seen is $139000 for a car with 54000 miles. BMW sold these as collectable cars so most are maintained in excellent condition. It isn't likely that many have been wrecked. The Z8 is a unique car that commands attention when you drive it. Beautiful finishing and fun make it a practical investment."
car_2879,WonderCar,"I've owned over 50 cars in my life, including some top flight iron. None has ever been the true combination of quality, style, power and fun-to-drive that the Z8 has been. I remember why I bought the car every time I take it out. Absolutely wonderful ride! I get thumbs up, stares and comments whenever I take her out. Great fit and finish, no mechanical problems and my BMW tech's have been wonderful to deal with. The best service anywhere! Gas mileage is OK, essentially 20mpg on the highway and mid-teens around town. I really love this car, but know someday I'll get the bug for something else and then may have to sell/trade the car. They are becoming harder and harder to find."

car_2888,Z8 is hands down the best roadster ever!,"This car peforms like a Ferrari.....but feels like a true German sports car.....I have driven Ferraris, Porsche, Lamborghinis, and I have never recieved more stares, and compliments.........I would only recomend this car if you can use it as a secondary car...........I also have a BMW X5...."
car_2889,Best bang for the buck (amazingly) in its segment,"I drove my smallroad from L.A. to Denver.  I went from 117F in Death Valley to 37F on Vail Pass, all in the same day.  The car had plenty of power cruising the straights of I-15.  I calculated my MPG during the trip, and it came out to 29mpg (rated 27mpg highway).  That's including climbing from sea level up to CO.  I have the Sport Package with the Sport Seats, and they were very comfy for my 1000mile trip.  There's all sorts of supports that you can change to make sure no single part of your body is aching from sitting in the same spot for too long.  I planned to break the trip up into two days, but I just love driving this thing too much, so I soldiered on through the night.  12noon to 5am.  Done and Done.  My only beef would be that while the xenon headlights are plenty bright, they might be aimed a little too low for me.  It was easy to overdrive them ;) ;) ;) There's plenty of brightness to project further ahead, but not sure if it would result in blinding oncoming traffic or not.  The MMI with Sirius is a godsend on a roadtrip.  If you are in the market for a smallroad, get the updated version where the controls are near the center armrest and not on the center dash near where the radio is.  It's so much easier to use that way."
car_2890,The Allroad makes sense...,"To begin with, I am a SUV refugee. I have lived in the Colorado mountains near Denver and got stuck driving SUV's to have snow clearance so that my vehicle wouldn't be turned into a snowplow at the wrong times. But I did need the space to haul road bicycles inside the vehicle in the summer during rainy weather along with baggage. Also needed power for climbing the mountains and good gas mileage for driving long distances without living in a gas station. This Allroad does it all with ease and style. This reminds me of my first Allroad of years past but this is truly a starship in comparison. Love this car and the handling is great compared to a SUV which is its true competition."
car_2891,Lift your spirits,"A great, fun dependable car.  I have enjoyed this car and still do.  Feeling down, then put the convertible top down and hit the curvy roads."
car_2892,older car new bmw fan,"Purchased this 1997 bmw z3 with 147400 miles on the clock  and fixed lamps out and several small problems , just a little tlc along with struts and rear shocks, carrier bearing on the driveshaft had to be replaced to take care of vibration,  tire  balance is very important on this car . wal mart balance lifetime for 9.,00 per tire is a deal.  long story made short  after service we drove the car 2000 miles trouble free on the blueridge parkway most of the time in fifth gear, this 2.8 with the 5 speed gear box is simply the most fun we have had in a car in years and is still a head turner, the car now has 150000 miles on the clock and oil level is still full.   this thing is a keeper."
car_2893,WOW What a Car,"Truly  my favorite sports car!!I have owned many including Corvettes, Trans Ams, Z28s, Mustangs, and MG Midgets, but this one takes the cake.Although I still own a 1970 Corvette (rarely driven these days), I still lust for the fun per mile that my Z3 delivered.My wife and I were looking for a sports car for my fortieth birthday back in 2005 and stumbled onto this Atlanta Blue 2.8 5 speed with tan interior.One test drive and the rest is history!The performance, economy, power, looks, and driving pleasure makes this my most fun since my old MGs (when they were running properly).I owned this car for five flawless years and drove the he'll out of it."
car_2894,Oldie but fricken goodie,"The 1997 Z3 1.9L straight-4 is really a unique find, at a great price.I would not pay more than $8,000 for one with around 80,000 miles on it, which is the car I got for myself.Incredible value for a truly zippy and economical car! Lots of fun to drive, and a real head turner for those of us who are into that type of thing.Dark green with tan interior and top is the way to go.Engine without a drop of any fluid on it.Very tight gearbox for a manual transmission, will get you up to 40 miles per hour as quickly as need be.Perfect commuter car!!!"
car_2895,Still Turning Heads after 14 years!!!,"Great car.  Plenty of zip for a 1.9 l.  It begs for acceleration into curves.  Very tight build.  Low slung.  Handles curves with vim and vigor.  Fun car to drive, especially on country roads.  Never had a BMW but now, the ultimate driving machine motto takes on real meaning."
car_2896,A Classic in all Respects,"While in college in the late 1960's, I owned an Austin Healey 100-4.  The Z-3 I purchased in 1997 had all the elements that I loved about the Austin Healey. The 6 cylinder in a must for the Z-3 and frankly the only color to consider if you are an aficionado is the dark green with tan interior and top. Any one who reports that there is insufficient power or that the top is too hard to put up is not a roadster devotee.  Boys, step aside and let the real men tell you what constitutes a genuine sports car. Thank you BMW for bringing back a car that is in the lineage of the Austin Healey, Morgan and MG."
car_2897,I love my Z3,"I have wanted this car since I saw it in GoldenEye and the deal I got was just too good to pass up.  It had only 29,000 mi on it when I bought it and everything in all the reviews that drivers had issues with had already been fixed (her father owned a BMW dealership) so it was perfect.  I am 5'2"" so it fits me to a T and I just drove 400 mi this weekend and was totally comfortable.  Every day I drive it someone comments on what a beautiful car it is and I agree.  It is not for everyone, larger drivers will not be comfortable, but they can buy any other car.  It runs like a dream and is very reliable, most parts that I have had to replace were the originals.  I intend to keep it forever."
car_2898,Looking for fun & fuel savings??,"After gas went sky high in mid-2008, I started looking for a commuter car, but also wanted fun. After some research, I decided on a Z-3, and looked on Auto Trader and E-Bay for a good one.  I was fortunate to find a 1997 with the 2.8 six cylinder, five speed and only 42,000 miles. After nearly a year, I can tell you this was a great choice. Plenty of performance and drop top fun, plus a solid 26.8 mpg.  I bet the 4 cyl are even better mileage, but the 6 is awesome. These cars have some quirks, like a sloppy seat track that allows you to slip forward and back on braking, but overall the car is a great value. Unfortunately, you aren't likely to find a good one at the Edmunds price."
car_2899,52 Cars Later,"I am sorry I have not bought at least 5 Z3s. Of the 52 cars I have owned in my life this is my favorite. When the car first came out a friend let me drive his 1.9 around Elkhart Lake and it was a ball, albeit under powered for that track. Then I bought the regulatory Boxster then an SL 500 plus others. At last I found a pristine 1997 2.8. Wow, this car is so well balanced that it makes even an old timer like me look good in the twisties. The 2.8 engine is wonderful. Lots of torque and smooth. Yes, I know the M; to me the M has so much power for the chassis that it is, Corvette like. I will keep my 97 for a very long time even if I find a perfect 2002. Enjoy!"
car_2900,"Beautiful, but full of bugs","I bought my Z3 used with 86,000 miles showing.  It has many of the typical flaws of this car.  Sagging glove box, sliding seats, leaky top, seriously crappy sound system, and cracks forming in the rear subframe.  It will be worth the price of admission once all the gremlins are finally taken care of."
car_2901,Understated,"The ""value"" of this car is understated in many ways.  It is so much fun to drive, and quite comfortable for an average size person.  On many occasions I have driven 800 miles in a day quite comfortably.  It continues to be reliable, and as it ages, the exceptional and unique design endures.  I believe the 97 2.8 will become a collector vehicle."
car_2902,BMW Z3 2.8 - one of the best roadsters,"I bought the '97 Z3 2.8L with the M body style, wide tail and tires, the first year of this style.   I think this body is a classic.  The Z4 is a bit crisp for me.  I have owned my car for 10 years and have had no problems other than a minor driver's seat rail play (seat slid back/forth) which I got fixed under warranty.  In 2000, I compared this vs. my neighbor's Porsche 2.5L boxster he wanted to sell me and this vintage of the two cars didn't render a big difference.   I felt the BMW 2.8 had more power than the Boxster and handled as well when I pushed both on a very windy back road.  There is a huge difference between the 4 cyl and 6 cyl BMW.  Once I drove the 2.8L, I said no to the 4 cyl."
car_2903,Sophisticated fun,"This car is absolutely a joy to drive.  It has almost zero body lean in high speed turns and the automated traction control keeps the tires sticking to the road. Its got that solid and sophisticated german road feel... like drinking a fine wine or smoking a good cigar. The sport seats are comfortable, and provide just enough room for me (6 feet tall).  Being a 2.8 and weighing 2,600 pounds, its got alot of jump from the get go, and mine came with a custom exaust that puts me up to speed a little bit faster.  The controls are pretty obvious and close to hand.  While limited in cargo space, if you're shopping for a z3, that isnt the main concern.  Awesome"
car_2904,Silver Bullit,"Great ride and handling with a strong grip.  Engine is a bit thrashy for a four, but the car is quick when need be.  Great value for the money with good reliablity.  One of the greatest styles ever."
car_2905,zooooooom,This is truly one of the most fun cars to drive. Excellent acceleration. You definitely need manual transmission for the true driving experience.Is there road noise? yes! That is what makes this car fun. Not only do you feel the road but you hear it as well. You have to drive one to know what I mean. Step on the gas and feel the rear end squat and the front end raise!!!!!!!!!!!!
car_2906,Incredible!,"This car drives really well.  Great suspension, great handling. Plenty of pep but not a high performance vehicle.It is without a doubt the nicest designed car that I have ever seen."
car_2907,'97 Z3,"'97 1.9 Z3, silver and black top. I 
think is the best color combination 
for this car.  The 4cyl eng from the 
318 is expectedly not powerful but 
enough for cruising. Fairly good on 
fuel but my accord is better. Somewhat 
cheap interior but otherwise its nice. 
The exterior is what shines on this 
car, it is pretty with top up or down. 
The short throw 5-spd and good brakes 
makes it easier to drive. The 
suspension could be tighter, at times 
it wanders esp. on rough roads. Wood 
interior is classy but the LED clock 
is almost useless topdown at daytime."
car_2908,Very Fun Car,"Even with the smaller 1.9 litre engine
this car is an incredibly fun little
car.  I don't mind the manual top at all
it takes 15 seconds to put it up or down
at the maximum and it's really easy to
do.  The optional subwoofer is a must -
otherwise you just can't hear music with
the top down.  My complaints are that
the seats move around a bit and one got
jammed after a small piece of plastic
got caught in the rail.  BMW removed the
plastic, then told
me that I shouldn't move the seats
completely to the front, back, top, or
bottom as there are known problems with
them.  Also, the center console
cupholder and storage feels cheap. 
Other than that, I love this car."
car_2909,Completely awesome!,"Atlanta Blue with Tan interior, and

I can't say I've had ANY problems with

Other than that one little annoyance, 
I can't say there's anything else 
wrong with the car."
car_2910,BMW Z-3 1.8,"All in all, an inexpensive sports car

very weak pick up. Good for cruising, 
not much more. Build qulity definitely

widely known by BMW on this model that 
they leave owners hung with to pay. 
Mine also has a manual convertable top 
which is a bit of a pain."
car_2911,97 Z3 Value,"Overall, even with the 1.9L engine, its 
not a bad cruising car.  Certainly 
great gas mileage.  Being a BMW, I 
expected a better quality vehicle.  
This car has less than 15k miles, 
garage kept, never in rain or snow.  
The seats rock, the power window

car_2923,Q5 Audi--Very overrated and Un-reliable,"I purchased this Audi Q5 from the original owner with 23000 on it. The brake rotors and pads were replaced at 19000 miles. I should have questioned this service at such low mileage--big mistake. I take excellent care of a car and drive it in a very sensible manner. It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated. The local Audi dealer is good, but with labor rates at $135.00 per Hr. well it just is not worth it. I would not recommend an Audi nor will I purchase one in the future"

car_2925,Great Little SUV,"I bought my 2012 Q5 brand new.  I chose the 3.2 engine because when I test drove the 2.0, I couldn't stand the way the turbo charger whined every time the car shifted. I love the way it hugs the road. I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet. Working the navigation system is confusing.  Not a great paint job. My dog's nails left a deep scratch in the bumper while he was getting into the cargo area."
car_2926,2012 AUDI Q5 - IT'S A LEMON!,"I bought this car new in 2012. Four years later the engine died, and the dealership wanted to charge me $6,100 to essentially replace the entire top half of the engine, due to a timing chain defect, and they refused to pay anything toward it. Absolutely unacceptable for a car that's basically new, with only approximately 75,000 miles on it. I made sure that I took it for an oil change every 3,000 miles and regularly scheduled service. If you are planning on purchasing an Audi Q5, DON'T DO IT! Do your online research (timing chain/transmission/etc.) and you'll see how poorly made these vehicles are."
car_2927,"Very Sporty, great quality but","This 2012 car (Premium) was not even on my radar as I wanted another sporty SUV but they did not have the color and specs I wanted. So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I'm controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don't always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let's not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier ""touch"" controls and less issues."
car_2928,Car of my dreams turns out to be a dud!,"I've wanted this car for 4 years. I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that's on top of the $399 price tag for the 'normal' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven't even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi's were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I'm not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless. After this experience I have lost faith in Audi. I definitely will not be purchasing one again. I do not feel that this car is worth the price tag...disappointing altogether."
car_2929,It Makes Me Smile,"I have shopped for an SUV for three years, awaiting the Jeep Cherokee, then opting for the AWD Nissan Rogue. When I couldn't get the color and version I wanted on time, I found a 2012 Q5 very lightly used for the same price as these new cars...only12k miles.

Today I took it on the infamous run to costco and found myself smiling...when the back gate opens automatically, when I stashed the wine bottles in the compartment under the rug, when I got in and turned on the Bang & Olufsen upgraded sound, and when the turbo kicked in and I shot past another car uphill. 

The build quality is excellent and this 3 yr old feels tight and solid. After my last Nissan Murano, it feels like a sports car"
car_2930,2.0 L is plenty fast,Very satisfied with our 2012 Q5. I would recommend the smaller engine to anyone. Very quick and plenty fast. Great gas mileage. The 8-speed must help that. My only grip about the engine is sound at idle when you are outside. It is only a sputter that comes out of the exhaust.
car_2931,Nice Car - Horrible service,Audi service is horrible.I bought new a Q7 TDI and a Q5 for my wife.First the Audi dealer overfills the oil in the Q7 causing all kinds of problems and would not fix them because the car was just out of warranty.Then my coolant in the Q5 starts leaking all over the garage and they say it wonÂ’t be fixed under warranty because the leak could be caused from an Â“outside influenceÂ”.I called Audi America who says Â“sorryÂ” nothing we can doÂ….I am going to relay my terrible experience on every blog I can find.Such a shame as I really loved the Q7 and thought I could get more than 70k miles out of it.FYI- Criswell in Annapolis was the dealer.
car_2932,Lovely vehicle but far too many issues for the price,"We've owned a Premium Plus (3.2) Q5 for around four months and have driven it extensively in city and on highway.It's a fine vehicle, very comfortable, and has plenty of power.However, there are many small issues with the car that really boggle the mind at the $50k-ish price.1. The multimedia system is, frankly, awful. It's design that feels a decade old, the control dial scrolls things the opposite way from other consumer devices (eg iPod), and the menu system is convoluted.2. The GPS is completely useless. The maps provided with the car are at least 4-5 years old and the routing is poor.3. The gas cap cover has broken already, 4 months in. Flimsy construction."
car_2933,audi the best,"Audi Q5 2012 my first and last suv.great to drive quiet, fun great handling, suspension, steering and trans, can be adjusted to your taste,all in all its the best"
car_2934,Rear hazards of the car,"Overall, great car.However, I would alert families to that the 2 tailpipes are nice looking but extend too far out from the car.I have a crescent shaped burn on my shin when I let the dog out of the back.Three small boys eating a snack off the back nearly missed being burned by these pipes.Since these events, I've noticed that most car makers do a better job of hiding the tail pipe under the bumper. Also, rear door does not stop quickly enough and for small objects in it's line of descent to a closed position.My son who is only 9 had it push down on him.If you can't get bags, body parts or dog paws out of the way in time, it could dangerous."
car_2935,2012 Q5 @ 20k Miles - Great SUV,"We just passed 20k miles on a 2012 2.0T Premium Plus; and just passed the 1 year anniversary of buying this vehicle.Overall this has been a great crossover SUV.Made it through the Chicago Winter and I found myself driving it more than my 2010 4Runner with 4WD.The AWD is great in the snow and on icy roads.The front seats offer a lot of room, and at 6'3"" AND 250 lbs.....I fit in this car just fine.Plenty of head room.More head room than most full size SUVs.The back section doesn't offer as much storage space as a full size SUV, but the back seats to fold (almost) flat to make a pretty good sized cargo space.If you need to haul a lot on a long trip, the integrated roof rails"
car_2936,"Q5 2.0 Premium After 12,000 miles","Amazingly fun to drive.Averaging over 25 mpg in mixed driving with a high of 29 and a low of 23.Transmission is quiet and smooth (unless I drive really hard, you don't even notice the shifts).Virtually no oil loss over my last oil change (7000 plus miles).Get the Audi Care Package as Service Costs are high."
car_2937,Q5 Audi review,The Audi Q5 is a wonderful addition to the Audi line up. This vehicle is traditional Audi with all the bells and whistles that makes an Audi and Audi. Great pick up and tight steering.It drives just as a German car should drive. The 8 speed automatic transmission is very smooth. The keyless entry and push button actions are what one would expect from a luxury vehicle.It is fun to drive. Mine came with the technology package which is a bit disappointing.
car_2938,"My last car was a BMW X5, Audi rules!","I think my title says it all! My last car was a top of the line X5 , with everything on it. I paid cash for it brand new. I owned it for 7 years....problems, little niggly ones, all the time. Trim that didn't fit, rattles, BMW issues! I loved driving that car though.  My Q5...leased it as I was wary about buying...everything has been perfect since day one. The fit and finish are perfect, driving it's wonderful and the dealer is 100% hassle free.Including the free car washes!"
car_2939,Good but room for improvement...,"This is a very nice car/cross over.Fun ride but you can feel all road blemishes.It handles extremely well.Very responsive steering. It has surprising acceleration. Excellent headlights.Not a wimpy looking cross over so as a guy, you won't be embarrassed.The Multi Media System... well lets just say they blew it (see below).My wife can't figure it out so she sticks with FM stations."
car_2940,Lower back problems driver seat,"Started having lower back problems one month after purchasing the car. Did not realize it was the car with my back until my husband drove it and he had the same problems. Had to trade after 14 months of owning the car due to the problems. Only after driving my new car for one day, already feeling relief."
car_2941,I left my Lexus for an Audi Q5,"After 15 years with my beloved Lexus RX300, which I passed to my daughter, it was time for a new ride.  I obviously adored my Lexus, but the new RX is huge, and the NX was a good size but had nasty yellowish pleather interior, boring handling and that awful spindle grill.   Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It's appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I'm proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.UPDATE, 12/27/2017, 1.5 years of ownership:I still love the looks and ride of my Q5.  There are things I don't love, though.  The mirrors are too big and block my view a lot, and the sun visors don't extend and aren't long enough for me (I'm 5'3"").  Voice control 'granny' is pretty slow.  The bluetooth connection with my iphone is quite variable, and the voice with google maps only works about 50% of the time (the built in navigation I don't even use, I'd much rather use my phone apps).  The a/c is not as good as the one on my 15 year old Lexus).  My windshield wiper sometimes takes a random trip across the window.  The doors are very heavy and tend to close when I don't want them to if I'm entering or exiting the car in a parking spot that isn't level.   Stuff in the back cargo area consistently shifts around a lot more than it ever did in my RX, though I'm not sure why, and I really don't like that I can't close the back cargo door with an interior button.  These are all relatively minor drawbacks, though there are many.  However, I really do love the way the car rides and handles, and it's still one of the classiest looking SUVs on the road."

car_2943,In pieces on the shop floor at 400 miles,"Beautiful paperweight for the first four weeks I owned it. Timing shaft tensioner failed, then second time in it was the camshaft that failed. Audi refused buyback saying basically ""too bad."""
car_2944,heavy passenger door,"Audi Q5 is a wonderful SUV overall, except the doors are causing problem for us. The doors are very heavy, and tend to swing close by themselves. My wife hurt her finger when putting staff in the car and the door was unexpected closing so fast by itself!  Watch for the doors, they are dangerous!"
car_2945,Great car as long as there is not a problem.,"This is our third Q5 in a row.  When the car was 2 days old the backup warning system failed and I backed into a mailbox   The dealer told me the system sensors needed a deep cleaning, which they did, but would not repair a small dent.  I complained to Audi, they said it is up to the dealer because that would be covered under the warranty.  The dealer said Audi refuses to pay for the damage.  During the next six months the GPS would freeze and the MMS system would simply not turn on at times.  I complained to the dealer again this times they told me there was an update to the software due to problems that Audi was having.  The dealer and Audi Still refused to take responsibility for a failed system.  This will be my last Audi not because the Q5 isn't a good car but because Audi does not back their vehicles like other companies I have dealt with in the past."
car_2946,Liked my 2014 Q5 so much - I leased another!,"I had a 2014 Q5 Premium Plus 2.0 lease that was up for renewal recently.   In over 30 years of leasing vehicles I've NEVER leased the same vehicle twice as every one of them seemed to have some quirk or flaw that made me want to try something different.   However, in this case I ended up leasing the a newer version of the exact same Q5.  Why? because I test drove everything else out there and could not bear to part with the Q5.   Superb all around car and hands down the best engines on the road today.   After 36K miles on the 2014, zero flaws and the exterior and interior still look it came off the showroom.   My new 2016 is even better, if that's possible. There is a reason this SUV consistently gets 5 star ratings."
car_2947,Sweet ride!,"I love the body style. Interior is somewhat lacking compared to the Mercedes GLC but still nice. Ride and handling is what you would expect from German engineering, flawless. I would definitely recommend this SUV."
car_2948,I loved my 2012 Q5 so much I bought a 2016!,"I purchased a new 2012 Q5 2.0T and drove it for over 120,000 miles without any problems.  It drove like a sports sedan and I regularly got over 30 mpg.  I am now own a 2016 Q5 2.0T and am amazed that with all the updates, the new one is even better.  Fantastic car!"
car_2949,Fun Car,This car is very comfortable and a pleasure to drive. Plenty of front seat legroom. This car has the Technology Package as well. Information/Entertainment center takes some study to learn. Can be difficult when driving.  This is a fun SUV to drive after driving a MB CLK350 for the past 5 years.
car_2950,Awesome Audi,The navigation system is not user friendly
car_2951,Bye Bye BMW,"I have driven BMWs since 1999.  I owned a 2000 540i, a 2004 X-5 4.4, a 2008 750iL, and a 2011 535i with the sport package.  At some point, between the 2008 and 2011 models, BMW turned into Lexus.  The 2011 535i was a thoroughly competent vehicle.  It had an excellent engine.  Everything else was just vanilla.  It simply was not the type of car you looked forward to driving.  I bought a 2016 Q5 3.0T.  Its great to drive a true German car again.  The steering in this car allows you to feel the road.  The suspension is firm and engaged but doesn't come close to feeling harsh.  There are plenty of luxury features.  in short, if you enjoy driving a car but like the convenience of an SUV, this is simply a great car."
car_2952,My third q5,Traded in a 2.0 liter q5. For loaded 3.0. Just love this vehicle. It is heavier then the 2.0 and better in ice and snow. The 3.0 liter is very quick and really goes when you need it. It is quiet with windows up and the sun roof is huge with no vibration with Windows up. A first for me. Voice command could be better and that's my only complaint. Quiet ride which is stiff and secure which I prefer. Decided to buy before model change because I knew what I was getting and really like this model.
car_2953,Audi Q-5 SUV,The Q5 is a solid performer in the SUV luxury class.  I am a full size guy- 6 feet and 222 lbs and it is very comfortable to drive. Handles well. Excellent sound system.  Nav ststem needs to be updated and was in the 2017 model Q7.  The version I have is very quirky to use and the female voice sounds like an 80 year old woman ( no disrespect intended). Excellent trunk space and seats go down easily. Other than Nav system the technology is very good.
car_2954,Idaho Audi,"This crossover is terrific. Design, ride, engine(3.0), cabin, acceleration...you name it and wow. Meets and exceeds our expectations. Technology is good but not up to some of its competitors in all aspects. Back up camera view is blue and orange....Not the best for visibility for the driver. No  collision avoidance...should be standard. Coming in 2017? Blind spot alert is very visible, a plus. Instruments well laid out. Controls intuitive...no more smudges on the screen. Sound system(B&O) aka as concert hall, very rich. Seat pre sets: steering wheel not included, a big oversight by Audi. Wipers and lights wonderful. Cabin noise could be less. Wife is 5'2"" so access is easy compared to other suv's."
car_2955,New 2016 Q5 speed and comfort..,New 2016 Q5 speed and comfort..
car_2956,Great Ride comes  w Great Luxury and Performance!,"I have had the pleasure of driving a well built, great performing luxury SUV, the 3.0T equipped, 2016 Audi Q5. I have chosen the S-Line model, which has some of the nicest body lines that compliment the Black Optics over Ibis white color scheme. Equipped with the Tech package and 21"" wheels, the Q5 is pure enjoyment! The black leather interior is practical, functional and very comfortable. I do have the Sport Interior, which gives you the flat bottom steering wheel and firmer sport seats with thigh supports. The Bang and Olefsen stereo is a superb sounding, enriching pleasure every time I play it a little on the loud side. With a well laid out display, the MMI response could be more responsive, but it is not burdensome. Satisfaction and contentment are equally matched with adrenaline and excitement whenever you need the supercharged V6 engine to come to life. Excellent throttle response leads to spirited acceleration, seat planting torque and miles of smiles as you allow this performance SUV to stretch it's legs. Audi has put forth a nicely balanced, visually and sensory pleasing vehicle at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this drivetrain package over the 2.0T level, as you get a firmer suspension, larger brakes, dual outlet exhaust and a horsepower/torque range that will put enjoyment at your finger tips!"

car_2962,Can Rule the Road,"Pros:Awesome interiorGood speakersDriver viewCons:No USB ports Outdated technologySummary: I have had it only for a month and below are a few observations. The drive is really good and driver vantage points are numerous. Quite a good amount of legroom for the driver. The road looks well lit with the awesome lights. The parking assist is really helpful.A few minor hiccups are, there are no USB ports. Has one connector in the glove box to hook up an iPod classic or older generations. Can add the new iOS connector as an attachment but cannot have the phone connected to it and Bluetooth on at the same time.Got only the Audi care package included and declined the packages for paint n dent protection. Got a ski rack included with the vehicle, it's lying indoors and will stay dead till the year I ski. A prospective buyer should probably negotiate for a cargo carrier if not interested in the ski rack.The drive and music are good, will know about the maintanence costs only after a few years."
car_2963,2016 Q5 Premium Plus from Naples,"My 2016 Q5 is an excellent overall car, looks great, interior finish is very good, and 2.0 Turbo runs very well with good acceleration.  Gas mileage is ok for 4 cylinder turbo and large gas tank gives you great driving range.  Gas mileage should be much higher on highway.  I get 26/27 at best on highway. Radio sound is excellent and easy media interface but no USB port.  The Navigation system works well and it's great to be able to send your directions to the car from Google or my cell. Overall the Nav is easy and accurate to set.  Voice controls works as well as any of them but could use work.  The push button start works well and the best feature is the side mirror closure when the locks and alarm are set.  Works great and all automatic on closure and on open.  The Audi grille and overall look is special and there's plenty of room in the rear compartment.  I also like that you can roll the rear seats forward for more cargo room, very nice.   Just a great car to drive and a great look and overall good functionality for a mid size SUV.  Get great feedback from all on the looks of the Q5."
car_2964,Great Car but poor city mileage,"I love driving this car, so nice but I wish few things were taken care of:1) USB Port not there2) Poor mileage in city driving conditions3) Not compatible with Apple Carplay"
car_2965,absolutely loving it !,absolutely loving it !
car_2966,Not so Great SUV!,"We bought the 2016 3.0 TDI prestige package with all options and initial we are very happy with the choice we made.  Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV's.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.  In my opinion ""Made in Germany"" is not that good anymore.  Its paid for so I have to keep it for a while."
car_2967,Very Nice Car,"The Q5 is well made, fast, comfortable and quiet.  The most impressive thing for me was the power of the 4 cylinder turbo.  I was really aiming for the 6 cylinder. But, it was unnecessary as the 4 is fast, powerful and it shifts beautifully.  The moon roof and features are impressive.  Gas mileage has been very good.  Overall, very happy with this decision."
car_2968,Love it and cannot leave it!,"We flip a coin to see who gets to drive our 2016 Audi Q5 on road trips. Can't say enoughabout all the positive aspects of this vehicle. Handling, comfort, interior, are all impressive.The sunroof is a great plus to this SUV as well, which filters to just let enough light in no matter what season."
car_2969,Early impression of a 2016 Q5 TDI,"I've become a big fan of diesels for their driving characteristics and efficiency.  The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I'm enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I'm pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase."
car_2970,2016 Audi Q5,superb! love this car!
car_2971,A 1 Thats our Q5,"Every category is 5 star except a USB port. We have owned the Q5 for 9 months, great vehicle!Couldn't be happier. As I noted prior a 2016 Q5 sh have had a USB. However, purchasing an adapter is not a ""big deal""...."
car_2972,2012 Q5 2.0T Premium,"Recently purchased the Q5 Premium with what appears to be the standard Option list in my area of Heated Seats, Sunroof, and Convenience Package.Only other option was the Monsoon Grey paint (I hate the extra charge for Paint). Car drives like an A4 with better utility.Gas mileage has been on the higher side (I drive mainly on a Parkway - with Stop & Go Traffic).Deceptively fast as you almost always feel you are going slower then the Speedo indicates, and quite smooth for an CUV.I should have ordered a Premium Plus stripped for the same base price, but did not want to wait 6 extra weeks.Best description, a Sports sedan in CUV body!"
car_2973,"Great car, bad brake!","Purchased the car new. Love everything about the car with the exception that from day one the brake squeaks, especially before it is going into a complete stop. In addition, the car produces a ton of brake dust: it will coat all the wheels with this dark metallic powder just a few days after cleaning, which completely messes up the appearance of the car, makes you feel like dressed up in a piece of brand new suit matched with a pair of stinky, worn out sneakers!"
car_2974,Q5 is Like an Apple Product,"I have a 2.0 Silver/Black with Moon Roof, Convenience package, Heated Seats and Exhaust Tips.In my area it was very difficult to find the 2.0 so I had to go 70 miles away to get one.I have no regrets.My Q5 feels like an Apple product and every time I am in it, it makes me feel good.It is fun to drive and the interior and exterior are top notch.I have owned 2 BMW sedans previously and also looked at the X3 very hard.I am a type that sticks to what has worked in the past and the 2 BMW's I had were just fine.I had some reservations about Audi's past quality issues.The bottom line for me was the Q5 was superior in everyway like an Apple product."
car_2975,Very sorry I bought this car.,"The Q5 is great but I've had a very bad experience with mine and can't give it a good review.The skylight shattered by itself in very cold weather, and the dealer told me it is a known issue with the 2012 Q5 in cold weather.The dealer has had the car for a month and its still not fixed.They say the skylight has to come from Germany and they can't get a correct replacement part.Rusnak says the'll make it up to me by giving me a couple of payments, but it doesn't really make up for the time lost.I bought the car because I wanted to drive it, and so far, it just hasn't worked out."
car_2976,One happy driver,Love my Q5 premium plus 2.0 turbo!I have owned it for 10 months and would not trade it for another SUV.Mileage is great and the drive is pure comfort.Bluetooth is wonderful if you NEED to talk.I would never get another vehicle without Bluetooth.A colleague is getting Q5 through a dealer swap in approximately 10 days.
car_2977,Awesome SUV,"This is a super car to own and drive. Have it for 3 months now and have about 3500 miles on it. As reported in many other reviews, this SUV rides nice and tight, feels fast, drives fast and is a lot of fun. Extremely quiet interior and the sunroof is huge."
car_2978,2012 Q5 Prem Plus + Nav 2.0T,"This cross-over is an amazing vehicle to drive. It handles like you would expect an Audi to handle. The Exterior is sleek, sexy and screams confidence. The interior is well laid out and the navigation system is a must optional upgrade. The panoramic roof lets the world into the cabin as your cruise around town. The steering does seem a little artificial at low speed,but as the car picks up the tightness and Audi feel kicks in. The 2.0T engine hums and out performs the 3.2"
car_2979,New Q5 Owner,"We've had our new Q5 for a month. We've driven an Acura MDX for awhile and love it. In terms of comfort and driving experience though, the Q5 is several steps beyond the Acura! Extremely quiet, firm comfortable ride, nimble handling, plenty of power from the 2.0T - even up the step grade of I-70 west of Denver. And, so far good gas mileage, about as advertised, but much better than our Acura. The tech'y stuff takes a little getting used to, Nav, Bluetooth, media, and personal/car settings. The car is a perfect size for a couple of empty nesters who will use this car on trips ... might be tad small for a family trip!"
car_2980,An Excellent Buy,"I own a 2011 Volvo XC60 and now a 2012 Audi Q5. Although very different cars, they both are excellent buys. However, the Audi is just plain fun to drive. It lets you ""feel"" the road and is responsive. I have had it for only 2 weeks, but I am in love with the car, its looks, and the layout of the interior controls."
car_2981,4 wonderful cylinders,"The 2.0T knocks the socks off most V6's.Off the line and anywhere in the RPM curve.The 8 speed transmission is a huge part of this performance, but I love every sound this car makes and driving it is a pure pleasure.Highway miles are exactly as promised at 27mpg, and road noise is minimal.Go for the 2.0T and never look back.The panoramic sun roof is amazing and rolling over uneven pavement provokes zero body noises.This is a solid car."
car_2982,Expectation Fulfilled,"I custom ordered a White/Cinnamon Q5 2.0T Premium Plus for my wife, which we took delivery of on July 30th.The car has meet our every expectation for comfort, utility, handling, and ride quality.The only thing missing is the backup camera's computer chip, which we were told is months behind in production from the Japanese supplier due to the tsunami.Despite an ok power rating of 211bhp, the car is very torquey.So, off-the-line acceleration and passing power are excellent.We got the B&O sound system, which sounds excellent and was worth the extra $750.My wife says that driving it feels like wearing a comfortable pair of jeans. When she's happy, I'm happy."
car_2983,Great,"Drives great, rides great - this is the best driving crossover/SUV I've even driven.Better overall quality/finish than the BMW X3, and nothing else comes close.The 2.0T engine has plenty of power, and the acceleration is much better than you would suspect - passing power on the highway is excellent.Options on the 'Premium Plus' are nice - Zenon Lights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, sunroof, dual setting memory seats.I don't know how much you get from a dual-zone climate control when you are sitting right next to the passenger - it's just one more thing to adjust.The bluetooth hands-free connection to a mobile phone, and speaker/mic is excellent.Highly recommended!!!"
car_2984,Gorgeous,"Love this car - I'm still breaking it in, but having had 3 new A4's in the last 12 years, this one felt like coming home (albeit with larger rooms).Have kiddies on the way so the extra room will help - cargo space is not huge but is adequate.The 2.0 litre had more balls than I expected - nowhere near as clunky as the Q7 I test drove- this one handles like the 2009 A4 with the same motor - pulls nicely and sits down while cornering.The moonlight blue is stunning - I wished I could've seen one with the cinammon interior but only the light tan was available.You'll notice the screen displays are sharper - kind of like going from an iPhone 3G to the sharper 4."
car_2985,Small is where it is at,"Owned this SUV for 2 years now.  A great little SUV we use mostly for weekend and trips.  It is perfect for us now than the kids have all gone away. Plenty of space for the 2 of us.   It has performed well and we have had no issue with it since the purchase.  The only issue I have is with the transmission and all the shifting especially when the vehicle is cold.  Once it gets going it can hold the speed with the best of them and it is very nimble on the road.  I also like the NAV system, and the audio system, very well done, simple and stylish.  The interior is very comfortable even after a 10 hour drive."
car_2986,Luckily it has a good warranty,"This car has been in service for back up camera failure, intake manifold failure, improper reattachment of a gas line by the service staff (scary) and today the engine light went on for some sort of electronic engine failure yet to be determined.  I have only owned the car for 24 months but am ready to sell and buy something I can count on.  In addition, there are many features that are missing that are offered by many luxury competitors such as homelink and the ability to set power seat positions for each driver.  The nav system is awesome and you can link your calendar to send it to the car for appointments.  However, the cool tech does not make up for the poor reliability.  It does not even come close."
car_2987,2015 Q3 Quattro - Engine light keeps going on,"If you don't mind spending your days at the service shop... I do, it's very inconvenient. I only have 20,000 miles.  I'm told there are no guarantees the engine light won't go on again at any time since this is what happens with all electronic systems with all cars. Luckily, I didn't have these problems with my BMW, Mercedes or Infinity. Oh, the service repair shop could care less about any inconveniences and will not give loaner cars."
car_2988,Best SUV for My Wife,"The Q3 is a perfect size SUV for my wife. We feel it is a very comfortable, safe, solid, and fun-to-drive car. We both like to drive this SUV than the other SUV, Lexis RX400. We feel more confidence and safe to drive Q3 than RX400.  Q3 inside design is very logic and convenient.  The SUV also has a great mileage on highway, we get 32 mpg at speed of 68 miles/hour.  The assistant driving and assistant parking options are very useful, especially for seniors."
car_2989,Great value for the Price,"We really like this vehicle. The handling and performance is great. I had read that the Q3 did not have the performance that the Audi line up has. It has great acceleration and braking. I am not looking for a 700 horsepower engine , I just want to be able to get good acceleration. The scrolls for all the lists seem to be backwards and the placement of the controls is not the best forcing you to look way down when using them. The MMI package is difficult to set up needing to get on the web and sign up and then putting in other information on the car. we like the interior and are happy with the space ( I have heard complaints that the storage was small we bought a smaller SUV and expect the space. I have driven an RDX, Buick Encore, the Lexus NX and the BMW X3 and like the Q3 better than these vehicles."
car_2990,Perfect auto for my wife..,this auto is great. i had forgot about the german engineering.  (had 2004 z4).we replaced  an acura rdx. New style v-6 (Japan) I cant believe someone only gets 17 mpg.on the average mine is 4 mpg better than the rdx. way better ride than the rdx.The q3 is about 1' shorter than rdx.
car_2991,Love my q3,This is a perfect size small suv. I love it I'm so glad they came out with this model. I get so many compliments on my white q3. It is vert comfy and drives great. Great on gas too.highly recommend this car.
car_2992,Love car,exelent car for all time
car_2993,Still perfect for me.,"I have been very pleased with the Q3.  It does everything I want so I have only good things to say. After 2 years, this car is still a pleasure to drive.  It still feels, handles and rides like a new car.  Would buy another when time comes."
car_2994,Not Happy with this SUV,I bought this SUV thinking I am getting a good deal but I am not happy with what I got.  I paid extra for the Navigation package and I assumed it would be touch screen.  I mean why would any car manufacturer make in dash system which is not touch screen in this day and age.  It sucks to enter a phone number using the inbuilt dial.  The entire system is so cumbersome.  It seems AUDI has really skimped on this model.  No way to fold side mirrors and no homelink either.  I am not sure what else is this model missing but I very skeptical about what AUDI had put in this model.  I will most likely trade in this vehicle for something else. This is my first and last Audi.
car_2995,The worst fuel consumption by far for similar cars,"I Had the 2015 Q3 premium for 6 months now and so far  I realy don't like it ... I had a VW 2012 tiguan Previous to this car and I miss it very much !!!

The car was in 3 different audi service to confirm My Audi Q3 2015 only does 17MPG Test was done by realy life scenario 

Confirmed by Audi america !
I Can provide formal documentation"
car_2996,Wonderful car but no Homelink,We bought this car and love it.  Great traction in the snow and quite happy with it.  However their is no Homelink so if you want to sync it with your garage door it does not exist.  How many high end cars don't have this option?  We hear the company might retro fit this into the car.  We will see and if they do it for cars already purchased.
car_2997,Just got it and it's great so far,We already have a full size SUV and found that 90% of the time we are just pulling around an empty trunk and hundreds of pound of extra weight.  There was no purpose in driving that thing for the majority of our needs.  So we got the Q3.  It gives the SUV feel but you aren't towing around all this weight and space that rarely gets used.  The trunk is more than big enough for grocery trips.  If you take out the covers on the trunk space and the door you can fit a lot more than you might have expected.  We just brought home 8 27 gallon storage bins from homedepot with room to space.  I wasn't sure they would fit in the trunk when we bought em.  It has plenty of room in the back for carseats.
car_2998,The Q3 had me at hello.,"After driving a sedan for the past few years, I was eager to to find a small SUV with sporty handling and all the bells and whistles.  I did a LOT of research and considered Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, Lexus NX, BMW X1, MB GLA, and a number of others that were ruled out long before test drive time, either due to appearance, quality or feature combinations.  Long story short, the Q3 won my heart on the test drive.  It sailed easily over potholes, twists and turns, and accelerated nicely onto the freeway.  I love how it rides, handles and brakes.  It has enough cargo space for my needs.  It's so fun to drive.  The experience at the dealer was great as well."
car_2999,The Cure for the Common SUV,"What a vehicle.  Has all the comfort and toys you would expect in a vehicle.  Very Comfortable, Agile,
Sharp, Excellent finishes, Fun to drive, Its the perfect size for those not having to haul a lot of things or people but yet enough room to fit more than a car.  You get the elevated height and of course the best AWD drive system out there, Quattro.  The Q3 was well worth the wait."
car_3000,Q5 3.0,Just bought a 2013 Audi Q5 3.0.  Great to drive and lots of power.  Has all the luxury items and is very fun and good looking.  Only issue is backup camera which is not working properly - will come on sometimes for a second but then shuts off.  We'll see how the dealer will handle.
car_3001,New to me - I love it!,"I have only had this car since 12/28, but three weeks in and I can tell you it's a much nicer ride than my old Highlander. The cabin feels a lot smaller, but the car is much smaller than what I had before.  The responsiveness is awesome. And can I just tell you, the automatic downhill assist saved my life? We had a huge snow storm here and I live at the bottom of a serious hill; downhill assist got me home safely. It kind of takes over the braking and all you have to do is steer. Made me feel much safer driving in snowy conditions. When I can get new tires I'll bet it will be even better!  All in all I'm really happy I bought this car."
car_3002,2013 audi q5 3.0t premium plus s-line,Great vehicle.  0 issues since we bought the Q5.  Purchased used from dealership with 12000 miles.  Audi service has been outstanding.Came prepaid with scheduled maintainence plan from previous owners... Thank You!Wife primary driver and commutes many miles for work.2 young children are the occupants for the rear seats.  Forward and rear facing child seats fit no problem.Only complaint is MMI.  And why is there not a separate (lone) button to control fan speed for HVAC?!
car_3003,2013 Audi Q5 3.0T Premium Plus S-line,"Currently at 24,000 miles with  no problems (knock on wood). The car is a great blend of luxury, performance, Audi & S-line styling, and daily function. The attention to fit and finish really delivers a first-class roomy/quiet driving experience. I previously owned a Q5 2.0T. I was really surprised  at the difference in the 3.0T engine - SO satisfying! While the 2.0T is an excellent engine, I did notice some turbo-lag. A five-time winner of Ward's 10 best engines, the 3.0L TFSI supercharged V-6 brings joyful acceleration with a flat-torque line (272 hp @ 4,780 rpm; 295 lb-ft; 0-60: 5.8 sec) – it really inspires! The 8-speed Tiptronic transmission is silky smooth. Panoramic sunroof 14-speaker B&O sound & rear view camera  are all very nice. Four passengers fit very comfortably; though five is a bit squeeze. Ample cargo space; we have no trouble loading up for camping trips - You can fit a couple mountain bikes in the rear, but the best option is a hitch or roof carrier. With 50/50 city/highway driving using premium 93 Shell V-power, my Q5 is gets 20-22 mpg. All highway definitely better; recent 600 mile trip managed 30 mpg."
car_3004,3.0T Premium Plus S-Line,"Excellent balance of luxury and performance. Surprisingly roomy in passenger compartment and trunk despite small footprint of vehicle. For premium price of q5, missing some features I had on previous car (see below in suggested improvements). MMI despite improved, still makes it cumbersome to change radio station. No preset buttons means having to scroll on MMI controller or scroll wheel on the steering wheel. Two memory seat positions but still requires you to manually adjust steering wheel each time you change drivers. The panoramic moonroof affords lots of light and view. Drives and handles superbly with the S-Line package. The flat-bottom steering wheel looks and feels great."
car_3005,2013 Audi Q5 2.0 - Good so far,"Have owned it for over a month now. The quality of interior and exterior is very good. The turbo responds well . I like the paddle shifters and the ability to temporarily switch to manual from automatic by using the paddle shifters when you need that extra power. The car is very easy to handle and responds well. But I am disappointed by the mpg. I am supposed to get 20/28 but I am getting 17 with 25% freeway / 75% city combination . I was hoping to get 21/22 at a minimum . I use premium gas (93) and I have already tried 3 different gas stations ( Exxon, Mobil, Sams). Do difference so far. I sold my MDX that was giving me 15 mpg for (25% freeway / 75% city combination ) and now I get 17 :( ."
car_3006,Great Vehicle in all ways but one,"I purchased the 2013 Premium-Plus in October, 2012 and now have ten thousand miles and can give an objective overview.Love the vehicle, the fit and finish is exceptional.It's quiet, quick, nimble and tight when driving.The suspension is quite nice, not to rough and no bounce whatsoever.The only complaint is that the multimedia system is dated for a 2013 model, especially in this class segment."
car_3007,Nice Car,"Bought the 2.0T Premium Plus, with Navigation, 19"" wheels and B+O Stereo in December 2012. The Edmunds review is dead on - this is a well-built, agile and luxurious car. I have a few nit-picks : the MMI system has a number of quirks - for example, upon startup, the car will reset the volume level (even if previously muted) and revert music playback to the beginning of the track that was playing when you parked, as opposed to the point in the track where you left off , which seems pointless to me;also, the gas mileage has been less than the EPA figures (but I suppose many cars share that trait).That being said, the joy of driving makes up forthese grumbles."
car_3008,2013 Q5 2.0T Quattro,"Bought it December 28, 2012. convenience package. Amazing car, i do not miss my last two 4Runners(03,11), love to drive that Crossover, great look, gas mileage is decent (91, 93), tiptronic is so cool, fun driving on manual or automatic sport or just D. Came with Michelin tires, do not have nav but the screen for radio and blue tooth is the same look and size.Heated leather seat. takes time to know all the set up inside the car, just be patient you are in a Audi. Now i don't mind beeing stuck in traffic:)"
car_3009,Love our new Audi Q5,"I did a lot of shopping around for about three months.  Found this immaculate Audi Q4 at our Lancaster Mercedes dealership.  It was a leased car trade in - super shape and the dealership could not be more inspiring, helpful and great to work with.  After 3 months I found the car for us."
car_3010,Swweeeeeet,"So far this Q5 is awesome. Great ride, good performance and reasonable gas mileage. All round it handles like a car, has the storage for gear and groceries and the comfort of my living room."
car_3011,Best car I've ever owned,"I don't have anything negative to write. Best value I've ever owned in my 54 yrs of driving. Go nonstop from Syracuse to Beaufort,SC (14 hrs) and my wife and I are not worn out by the trip... very comfortable and accommodating."
car_3012,Love It!!,"The only issue I have with the Q5 is that it isn't as quiet a ride as I expected. Although Audi dealership did try to do something about it, I tend to get wind noise in around the windows. The navigation system isn't as intuitive as I hoped. Other than that, I absolutely love the car and may end up buying a newer model when I'm ready to get a new car."
car_3013,"Q5 - great drive, poor comfort","Q5 - great drive, poor comfort"
car_3014,"will keep till 80-90K,still excelrnt vehicle!","Being picky, the only drawback to this fine car is the computer behind the nav system. Steep learning curve and not easily used info input system"
car_3015,Help is on the way,"This is my third update on a review posted shortly after I bought my 2014 Q5 TDI.  I loved the car then and I still do today, despite Audi's diesel fiasco.Pros:1. This is a very comfortable car to sit in on the commute and long hauls. The front seats are great unless you want to pretend it's a sports car, in which case they lack a bit of lateral support. The Q5 does its suburban transport function perfectly well and the panoramic roof glass gives it an airy feeling.  Like all the Audis in my experience, the driver's sight lines are excellent.2. The fuel economy has gone from outstanding to somewhat higher than that.  In the same mixed driving pattern since purchase, I'm now averaging 31-33 mpg measured at the tank (the low end of that range in winter).  High 30s with pure highway driving.  For a 4400 pound truck with a 5000 pound towing capacity, that's supernatural. 3. About that towing capacity; I still haven't hauled any really heavy loads but the Q5 tows 1000 pounds of motorcycle plus trailer with barely any hit on fuel consumption.4. Driving dynamics are very good within limits.  Body roll is minimal for an SUV, the steering is reasonably quick and accurate without being nervous, braking effort is linear and absolute stopping power is good but not stellar.  Ride quality is quite good, striking an excellent balance of composed cornering without too stiff damping.  While I usually don't ask much of the engine and rarely spin it above 1800 rpm, when acceleration is called for at any speed that initial torque surge is amazing.5. The Q5 is good in winter, particularly since I put on Nokian Hakkapeliitta winter tires (probably not needed but they provide more braking performance in snow).  Excellent ground clearance, the wheel wells don't get packed up with snow and the traction control is effective without being intrusive.  It would be nice to have a locking center diff but the Quattro is perfectly fine for most snow conditions.  The defroster does a good job but it would help to have a windshield option as it does get packed up with snow and ice at the base and left side of the window.6. VWAG finally has a plan to deal with the 3.0 liter diesel scam and it looks good.  Last year I got a $500 debit card for any purchase and another $500 card to use exclusively at Audi dealerships.  Now they're on the verge of recall the car to implement the fix, which appears to be limited to ECU reprogramming.  We will have to see if this adversely affects performance or fuel economy with no third party reports yet, as far as I know.  One cause for optimism is that a friend of mine with a Golf Sportwagen TDI had no degradation of mileage or performance after recent fix of his 2.0 liter I-4.  Audi will also evidently give me something in the range of $7000 compensation with a smaller amount coming from Bosch.  That will have a significant impact in cost of ownership (and might put me in a new Porsche Cayman or Corvette Grand Sport when I trade in my other car next year!).Cons:1. The steering has poor on-center feel which is a bit irritating when I set out on highway driving although after a bit of time I stop noticing it.2. While the stopping power is adequate, the initial brake feel is spongy.  I much prefer brakes that have a strong initial bite and linear rise in stopping power, like those on my Audi S4. 3. The defroster is adequate but in very snowy conditions it would be nice to have a heated windshield base or heated washer fluid.4. I would prefer to have engine stop start switch in a more intuitive position.  The system itself is not bad; the engine restarts quickly and smoothly.  But I only want to use it when I anticipate a relatively long stop, like arriving at a traffic light that has just turned red.  So I am turning the system on and off multiple times in local driving but it's hard to find the switch without taking my eyes off the road.5. The interior trim on the driver's side door and left front of the dashboard reflects sunlight on the instruments and windshield under some circumstances.  It's an occasional minor irritation.  Overall, it's hard to find much to complain about with this car!"
car_3016,"$55,000.00 Vibrator","No, it will not be satisfactory for that either!  Seriously, I traded my 2002 Audi S8 which had massive engine failure at 118,000 miles for a new '14 TDI.  I commute from Tampa, FL to just beyond New Orleans, LA.  I was looking for the ability to tow a small trailer, get good mileage and like all wheel drive.  Seemed pretty good, but there was a huge catch.  Vibration.  There is something called vibration tolerance.   It seems the longer a human is subjected to vibrations, the more aggravating the particular vibrations (generally low in frequency) become.  Every trip I made (10 - 11 hours total trip time) I was feeling pretty bad upon completion, nauseous and jittery.  I've owned diesel cars before and have been a ship captain for many years.  I'm accustomed to diesels.  I've never had this issue before.  This is not something that could come as a surprise to engineers.  It is well known.  I got the impression that accountants were running the engineering.  It's called ""Value Engineering"".   After being fully prepared to follow Florida Lemon Law, Audi corporate made be a generous offer to trade for a 2015 Audi SQ5.  Most regrettably I accepted this offer.  You may be interested in my review of the 2015 Audi SQ5 when posted.  At present I'm engaged with the Lemon Law process but suffice it to say I'm more convinced at ever that Value Engineering is the single overriding ""Truth"" in their engineering.  Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.Update:  None.  Glad to be done with VW/Audi!"
car_3017,LUV my Q5,"Just buy it! You'll luv it, too!"
car_3018,The best of all worlds,"Acceleration is terrific at any speed, torque equivalent is a big block V8. Gas mileage is outstanding. Getting calculated 37MPG on a long trip is common. I'm averaging 32.2MPG in 18,000 miles of ownership. Traction is outstanding with quattro. OEM Michelin Latitude's are ok, not great, so I think traction could be further improved with better tires. Shifting is smooth in all gears, although the shift from 1 to 2 only after the idle stop was engaged is the slightest bit rough. Interior materials are first rate, layout is very intuitive. MMI is very good, nav takes a few minutes to start up on initial startup, I really like the LACK of a touch screen nav system. Everything is controlled through the selector wheel and buttons, Hands are closer to the wheel, no stretching for the nav screen and less eyes off the road. Cargo capacity is ok, but you know that buying this vehicle - if you need a Suburban, go buy a Suburban.Audi's tend to be a bit more sporty than the Mercedes, and on par with BMW. Consequently the ride is never harsh, but a bit firmer than you may be used to coming out of a Merc, or certainly a Lexus, which places a higher priority of comfort over better handling. Having said that, this is a heavy vehicle and center of gravity will be higher than any sedan you compare it to. Comparing this size SUV to any other comparably sized SUV, it's hard not to like everything it offers. Price is a reflection of the technology, materials, and performance you get, which is to say, it doesn't come cheap.Comfort, room, performance, fuel efficiency, quality of materials, and build quality, Compare it to anything you like, you won't find everything this vehicle - as a TDI - delivers anywhere else."
car_3019,"Love the TDI, Skip the MMI package","Fun car to drive. The diesel engine is amazing, especially on long journeys. The acceleration is fantastic, very good for road trips as well as battling the everyday commute.

The MMI is total crap. Voice recognition doesn't recognize much, and the navigation takes far too long to start up. I've given up using it. The stereo system is a bit on the quiet side, even with the B&O package."
car_3020,No spare and no run flats.,"What i love:seeing the motor shut off when going down the hills-even at 70mph. Electric only until I press down too hard.  I've got two cars-- a hybrid + a regular Q5.
What I don't like:  No one bothered to tell me that it has no spare tire--even the sales lady missed this.
In fairness--if I get a flat--I'm not gonna tackle trying to fix it myself anymore at my age---but come on guys!! Don't count on any below the floor storage space. 
With the sports package the seats are wonderful.  Gas mileage is good for a car this size.....but at the price that's not so much as issue. Almost got the BMW X3 diesel--but this thing blows the BMW away with it's power-- with about the same gas mileage."
car_3021,Agile and sporty but not a sedan,"I have had my 2014 Q5 TDI for around 6 months now so feel comfortable writing a review. Overall it's a great car: it's fun to drive and it feels agile and sporty. The mileage is generally better than advertised: we took a 2,000 mile road trip this summer and with 4 people and luggage we averaged just under 37 MPG -- going through the Canadian Rockies. I liked this car better than the other smaller SUVs I test-drove (Lexus, Cadillac, BMW.) On the down side, the steering can feel remote and the center of gravity is definitely higher than my 2000 Mercedes E 320 sedan (or maybe I'm just used to it) I ordered all of the options, including the tow hitch, which made the car rather expensive."
car_3022,Q5 Quality Has Gone Down Significantly,"Bought my 1st Q5 in 2010 (3.2, in Canada), and had to sell when we went overseas. Came back to US and leased a Q5 again since 1st time it was so great. But things have just gone downhill for Q5 quality:
- Check engine light came at 3000 miles
- Multiple trips to dealer to fix it
- Rear tire starting showing low pressure
- Again, multiple trips to fix it
- Other rear tire BURST...yes  just BURST on the highway at high speed....lucky to be not hurt
- Stayed for 30 mins on hold before Audi roadside assistance could finally help
- Got home and dealer basically not even responding to have the tire replaced ! No am not talking free....but a fully paid one from me? wtf !"
car_3023,So much to love but so many annoyances!,"This car handles terrifically; as smooth and responsive as any BMW or Lexus I've owned.  The diesel has so much low end torque that you'll blow off kids in hot cars without meaning to.  The car is beautiful and comfortable and the sound system excellent.  All that being said, I'll never buy another Audi based on this car.   The car 'lags' when trying to accelerate just a little from an already-slow speed (like turning at an intersection with pedestrians; or waiting for a break in oncoming cars while turning) leaving you in dangerous situations at times.  The electronics are WAY behind the curve: you have to take your eyes off the road and hand off the wheel for FAR too much.   NOW of course there's the whole matter of the diesel engine polluting the air up to 40 times the legal limit.  As if there wasn't enough to dislike about the car already......."
car_3024,Driving the 2014 Audi Q5,"I have been extremely satisfied with my Q5 Prestige 3.0 TDI .  The car is fun to drive, has lots of power and gets excellent mileage.  For the last 37,000 miles I have averaged over 35 miles per gallon.  This includes both town and highway driving.  (Town driving is approximately 30 MPG and highway is near 40 MPG.)"
car_3025,Known Navigation problem that Audi will not tell you,"I own the 2014 Audi Q5 TDI for 6 months. Love everything in this car except MMI. Recently discovered a problem with Navigation - sometimes, it looses GPS signal and when re-acquires, it recalculates your position by 1-2 miles off your real location. MMI reset does not help. All that helped so far, is to stop the car, turnoff the ignition, and wait for 10-15 minutes. AUDI is aware of this problem, but has no solution. Today, after 6 month of very gentle use, I have only 6K miles on the car, its rear view camera stopped working, shows green chaotically blinking stripes and rectangles. I am very disappointed. I planned to keep the car, but now I am glad that I leased it first."
car_3026,"Brakes at 31,000 Miles","At 31,000 miles, the dash indicator screen told me I needed brake pads. Over a third of those miles were put on during 2 road trips. Yet when I questions Audi both at the dealer leveland at the corporate level, I was told that on the Q5 & Q7 models, the brake pads must be replaced around 25,000 to 30,000 miles. I have owned many automobiles including 5 other Audi cars. I have never had to replace brakes at 25 - 35,00 miles"
car_3027,TDI engine is a superstar,"I cross-shopped the Q5 against the X3 35i, XC60 T6, Range Rover Sport, and Cayenne.All had their strengths, but I fell in love with the Q5's TDI engine.In short, it provides the best of both worlds.It explodes off the line like a rocket thanks to its considerable low end torque, but also returns fantastic mpg, often reaching 35 mpg on the highway.I had no idea diesels were so much fun -- I preferred it to the petrol inline sixes in the XC60 and X3.You can get the same basic TDI engine in the Cayenne, but it's at least $20k premium over a similarly equipped Q5.And just so you don't think I'm too easy of a grader when I say it ""explodes"" off the line, I'm coming from a C63 AMG."
car_3028,2014 Premium Plus TDI,"Our Q5 TDI is only four days old and already impresses. Premium Plus with MMI, B&O sound system, tow hitch and side assist.Per the computer that might be optimistic, we got 37 mpg on the mainly highway trip home from the dealer.Managed 33 mpg on the way into work (uphill) and 37 mpg on the way home.The OEM tow hitch is a clean install and they gave me a color matched insert for the back bumper if I ever get rid of the hitch. The auto stop system is not intrusive."
car_3029,Power and efficiency,"Audi Q5 TDI Premium Plus, Scuba Blue/Chestnut interior with ash inlays.Car had to be ordered and delivery took 82 days which felt like an eternity. The engine response is very good, but like the articles there is a very slight lag.It has no affect on any real world merge or passing situation IÂ’ve encountered. The first 350 miles have been about 100 miles in town and 250 miles on an Interstate Highway road trip (70 mph). The in town mileage was around 24 mpg and overall for the 350 miles it was 31.4 mpg.Uses auto-shutdown but the start-up is very fast so there is no issue about keeping people waiting behind you.This function can be turned off from the dash."
car_3030,Subaru Forester to Audi Q5,"I was impressed and planned to upgrade to the top model '14 Subaru Forester XT after driving my '02 Forester for the past 12 yrs but after test driving the Audi Q5, the overall quality, detail, and refinement of Audi completely ruined the XT for me! For comparison the XT has more power (250 hp), better fuel economy (avg 25 mpg), greater cargo space (~75 cu ft), and costs ~$5000 less.No matter you can feel the superior quality and craftsmanship in material, workmanship, and engineering in every detail and step of the gas pedal in the Audi. I love the quick acceleration in Sport mode and the refined executive styling and boss 18"" wheels! I look fwd to and enjoy driving it each and every day!"
car_3031,Art of Wheels,"We looked at a RX350, RDX, X3, SRX.This is the runaway winner.Great timeless design, wonderful interior design and material quality, great step in height and the list goes on.Bought this after owning a 2012 ML350.My wife is 5 foot and ML350 step in height too high.She loves this vehicle, great for a shorter person, perfect size.Have all options on ours except 19 inch wheels.Wish it had power tilt/telescoping wheel, probably only missing options.Very thoughtfully designed, seems overpriced but the devil is in the details.It was worth $8000 more than the RDX after sitting in both back to back.Have had it for a months and we love it, still like my BMW 550 more though!"
car_3032,Audi Q5 TDI - Better mileage than advertised,"My new 2014 Audi Q5 TDI has a little over 1700 miles. I've been very careful during the break-in period, which happened during extreme cold temperatures and much snow and ice on the roads for a few weeks in February. The car would start flawlessly every time even at temperatures of -20 F in the mountains of Colorado. I've averaged 25.5 mpg in the city during cold weather and snowy roads. On a 180 mile round trip from Winter Park to Steamboat Springs, where you start at 8800 ft, go down to 7000, then up to almost 11,000 ft and then down to 6,800 ft I averaged 35 mpg with 5 people in the car, skis on the roof and a fully loaded trunk. From Boulder to Colorado Springs and back I averaged 41.5 MPG.Update: After owning this vehicle for two years I'm just hoping it is not too good to be true with the diesel scandal. I bought it because it had power and speed to spare while using very little fuel and polluting less than a gasoline car. That may still be true for CO2 emissions, but it is not true for NOx emissions, and that is very disappointing. I'm hoping the fix will not reduce my power or fuel economy. I've averaged almost 31 mpg over 25,000 miles, with no mechanical or electrical problems. My biggest complain is the Google Earth based GPS. The time to arrival algorithm is not very accurate, especially when driving in the mountains. It can be 30 minutes off on a two hour drive. In the city though, it is accurate enough.I bought snow tires to get one more season out of the all seasons it came with, but I still think the original tires will not last as long as expected. The Audi Q5 is excellent in the snow with these new snow tires. I did notice an appreciable difference in traction, but it does not corner as well as with the all seasons, as expected.Last year we drove the car from Colorado to California and from Colorado to the East Coast. It was such a pleasure we may do it again this year. The seats get a bit hard after 6 hours drive, so we bought a seat cushion for long trips after the first one and our bottoms thanked us.Update: The major change I've seen is my mileage has increased to an average of 31.6 of combined driving in the third year, from 30.8 the first year. I don't know if that's due to the engine loosening up and becoming fully burned in, or because the original tires are getting worn out. I have 34,000 miles and I have measured up to 40.5 MPG on one trip. Usually the computer is off by up to 1 mpg, so figure at least 38-39 mpg on the highway through 3 Colorado mountain passes.I hope Audi can fix the diesel cheating problem without affecting performance. I don't know of any other car that can perform similarly or better (range, MPG, AWD, ground clearance, acceleration, comfort, luxury, quality). Maybe next year the plug-in hybrid can come close or surpass it.Update (Mar 26, 2017): Audi may offer to buy back my 3.0 TDI Audi Q5 if they cannot solve the diesel problems by December 2017. I would take them up on the offer if I could find another vehicle that performed equally or better than what I have for a similar price. I don't think there is one, if I want similar range (600+ miles), acceleration (6.2 sec 0-60 mph), fuel efficiency (30.8 MPG combined, down a bit because of the use of snow tires), road clearance (7.9 in) , turning diameter (38.1 ft), and combination of length and cargo space on an AWD car. I am very happy with this vehicle after 38,500 miles but I don't want the pollution stigma."
car_3033,2014 Q5 TDI Owner Long-term Report,"At 38,000-miles and just over 3-years of ownership, the Q5 TDI still impresses! It's a pleasure to drive, comfortable, handles extremely well and love the torque produced by the TDI engine. The diesel mileage is impressive for a car of this size. Still getting 30mpg overall and on the interstate mileage is in the mid-30s. Audi will not be getting this car back - this is a keeper!08/13/2017 Update:  Completed a 3,400-mile road-trip this past June. A lot of interstate driving and driving through Colorado mountains. Car performed flawlessly! The car is comfortable and powerful and was maxed-out load wise for part of the trip. Carried luggage for 4-people! Absolutely no mechanical issues. Interstate mpg with cruise at 78-mph returned 34-mpg. As I said before, Audi will not be getting this car back - this is a keeper!"
car_3034,Upgraded CRV,"I recently purchased a Q5.I chose it as a medium option between the more expensive SUV's (X5/ML/Cayenne) and the more economic CRV/4runner/CX5's.In retrospect, I would categorize it with the second group and is overpriced for the quality.Peformance:Feels faster than it actually drives, particularly in the 50-70 range needed to merge onto major highways.The Q5 is fun to drive, until you look around and see that you're not accelerating as quiickly as you think.Interior:Cheap leather and interior surfaces look more similar to an accord or CRV than a luxury SUV.The computer/MMI seems out of date and dial is tough to use.Panorama sunroof is too big and gimicky."
car_3035,Fantastic Automobile,"I had shopped around a bit in Los Angeles for the ideal car for my wife. She had very specific requirements for color and engine...tan or brown on brown and fast. There was only one brown on brown in the state at the time with the supercharged 6.We found Steve Miller at Santa Monica Audi on the internet who was enthusiastic about selling at my asking price of $3,000 off sticker-no questions, no hassle, bada bing! Since day one, the car has been a dream.Both of us drive the car, but she probably airs it out a little more.It is an SUV that thinks it's a sports car. It's a great car. No problems. Gives us a reason to go drive...even in LA."
car_3036,This is my 1st and will be my last Audi,"Bought the Q5 Premium Plus from Tony Peng at Penske Audi. Tony was very helpful, no presssure sales, very smoooth and enjoyable.The finance girl was no pressure either.Love my experience at the dealership, 5-star.I was debating between a BMW X3 and this Q5.What won my heart was its seat, very comfortable.The drive was smooth.This is the Pros.Cons?The navigation system is the WORST!It is so difficult to use that I ended up using my iPhone map/GPS which is FREE.The Audi system costs $4K!! At this price range, this system is totally un-acceptable.Advice for potential buyer:test the navigation system and be sure you accept its performance."
car_3037,Q5 3.0t Prestige,"Traded my 2008 base model Cayenne for the Q5 3.0 and so far (1 month later) it's a great success.It's just more fun to drive and I didn't need as much cargo space.The 0-60 time, ride quality and sound system are all better in the Audi.And of course the agility and parking ease are better due to the smaller size.Audi MMI maybe has overkill on some features such as 8 different ways to enter a destination into the Nav so maybe there's a little more money invested than absolutely necessary.Also better than the Lexus RX I had before the Porsche"
car_3038,Great SUV great engine,"It's a great car with a very powerful engine and agile. The Q5 has an impressive torque and can reach 100 km / h in just 5.9 seconds. It's awesome. Its exterior lights have a very modern and sleek design. The interior finish and quality of materials are amazing. The start-stop system saves a lot of gas when traffic is heavy. Bang & Olufsen radio sounds spectacularly well, with great clarity and sound quality. wheel drive because it shows the car has really stuck to the road, giving great driving safety. Engine power is noticeable especially on steep climbs and road overtaking. The chassis structure is firm and sturdy and gives assurance and poise to handle the car. The Audi drive select syst"
car_3039,Amazing...so glad I traded.,"I bought the Q5 on Monday after 7 disappointing months of driving a 2013 Volvo S60. I could not be happier. I test drove a few other smallish SUVs and this blew them all away. The interior is beautiful and logically set up. I love the panoramic sunroof, the sound-system and most definitely the bigger engine. I drove the 2.0 and could tell a difference and for me it was worth the price jump. The Audi dealer gave me excellent trade value for the Volvo and the transaction was painless."
car_3040,Best visibility if you are height challenged,"The Q3, in my opinion, drives much better than the A3."
car_3041,To Vermont and back to Texas,"Well you can say what you want about the limitations of the Q3, on the whole the vehicle is a fine machine. My 2016 Q3 has now 21,150 miles on it and has not missed a beat. Recently drove from Houston, Texas to Fair Haven, Vermont and back in ten days; it was a great experience from start to finish. The Q3 met every challenge along the way averaging 32.5 mph at posted speeds. Handled great, avoiding two possible truck encounters and a Northeaster that dumped 24 inches on us in Vermont.  The all wheel option did well in the snow as well as in the rain and ice.  Heated seats came in handy in 5 degree weather while the heated side mirrors made it easy to drive in the blowing snow conditions. A USB port would be nice but the Bluetooth option for Pandora and Audible made the trip a fun experience.  If you want a good value with multiple option plus good mileage, the Q3 is an SUV worth considering."
car_3042,Highly recommend,We owned 2016 Q5. After only a few months we were in a serious accident & it was totaled. Safety features became obvious & we bought another one.  2017.
car_3043,My 2012 Q5 flooded in Harvey so I got another Q5!,"It has the most stylish lines of any comparable SUV on the market. Handles like a sedan with permanent 4 wheel drive. The 2017 is much quieter than my old 2012 too and with the B&O speakers, that's a plus!"
car_3044,Not the Best,Do your homework before purchasing this vehichle.
car_3045,Love This Vehicle,Purchased Ibis White with Pistachio interior.  Great vehicle to drive and very solid and comfortable.
car_3046,Brakepad Eater? Tire Eater?,"I wanted this car big-time. I have been researching it, along with the BMW X1, for several months. But I recently learned that a couple of friends I trust have this car. They like it ok, but expressed concerns about the expense of maintaining the brakepads and tires. The X1 is faster -- by a fraction of a second -- if that matters to you a lot. But I have owned 3 BMWs over the years and have found that their engineering is very hard to beat. Add to that that the pricing is much better on the BMW, I think it makes more sense."
car_3047,Awesome Vehicle,"Incredible style, ride and comfort with a good balance of power and mileage, BUT cost goes up more than mileage savings due to price premium of premium fuel."
car_3048,"Looks good, good mileage, but major engine problem","I do enjoy driving this SUV; it's comfortable, good looking, and performs well. Instrumentation is overly complicated and requires some study if a driver is older. In the first week of owning it, the car developed a major engine problem that originated on the manufacturer's assembly line. The repair was major, and I was advised by independent engineers that there is no assurance that this car could not have another major problem in the future. The dealer was sympathetic and offered me an Audi Care package and 12,000 new car warranty miles.  They think this should cover my inconvenience, but I have no assurance that this Audi will hold up for the long haul.  I don't think I got what I paid for."
car_3049,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Shopped around quite a bit for a mid-level luxury car and the Q5 ultimately met all my desires.  A little bit more road noise on the highway than I was expecting but beyond that, the vehicle is awesome!  Luxurious while practical and looks pretty damn good out there on the road."
car_3050,Audi heaven,Can't go wrong.
car_3051,Read This First,"My wife has always wanted an Audi. So when our 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Lease ended we ""Upgraded"" to a 2017 Q5. The vehicle is a disappointment! I wish I could take it back. What we Lost: Remote Start, Touchscreen Infotainment with larger screen, Heated Steering Wheel, USB ports, and half our Trunk Space!  You can't advance songs from the steering wheel, the volume knob is on the far side of the gear shift, & it's a 2 step process to lower the air power. Another annoyance is the wiper blades can't be raised, so cleaning ice and snow off the blades is a chore. Plus, you have to pay for 10k, 20k, and 30k maintenance or spend another $900 for their Audi Care plan. Yes, it's gorgeous and it handles well in the snow, but the infotainment system is overly-complicated.  I've learned my lesson... Looks aren't everything. It's ""luxury"", but totally impractical."
car_3052,I'm in love...,"My Q5 is gorgeous -- inside and out and I can hardly wait to drive it every day!  It is such a pleasure to drive. Absolutely love the panoramic sun roof!  Please note that I have only owned this car for one month so I cannot rate its reliability or maintenance costs (I left it on the default rating of OK or NA).     However, with regard to everything else it is a perfect fit for me.   I wanted a smaller SUV that was not a gas guzzler but was capable of towing my horse trailer but was also a little sporty.  I have not towed with it because it was a CPO and no tow package included.  Manual says it can tow up to 4500 lbs and the reviews say the car tows easily.  (My aluminum 2-horse trailer weighs 2000 lbs and my horse weighs about 1200 which means I can tow with 2 horses in the trailer which is perfect!)"
car_3053,Luxury interior,"The interior of the Q5 is much nicer than the BMW X3. Test drove both the 2.0 and the 3.0 six cylinder and unless you need the extra hp, (towing or mountain roads)  the 2.0 four cylinder is plenty. Didn't really want the full sunroof but it shouldn't be an issue in cooler climates."
car_3054,Audi Q5 2.0,Audi Q5 2.0
car_3055,One year out and still enjoying my Q3,"I purchased my 2016 Prestige Q3  quattro with the Sport Package in Nov 2015 and love this SUV. I surprised myself when I bought this since I wasn’t looking for a “luxury” SUV. However, I had shopped for over a year and drove virtually every other SUV in its’ class and was just not impressed with the drive and handling (or sound systems) of the Q3’s competitors. I love how this SUV handles on winding roads and love driving it so much I look for excuses to take it out! I’ve read several reviews suggesting the Q3 may have below average acceleration and power but have not found this to be the case at all, even with passengers in the car. To me it’s like driving a sports car with an awesome sound system. Some blogs suggest you can purchase a Sprint Booster module for even faster acceleration but I don’t feel I need it. There is no lag in acceleration when I hit the gas unlike other SUVs in its’ class that I have test driven. I’ve only needed to take in for service for the first oil change/checkup; its' basically been flawless since I bought it over a year ago."
car_3056,"The best car I have owned, truly","This is my first Audi, but I have had several VWs and they are the same ""family"".  I have owned it 6 months.  It is nimble, handles the road well and it accelerates well when I need it to.  I love back country roads with hills and corners and would call this a ""driver's car"".  If you enjoy driving, this is great for that and driving is not boring.  I already used the word nimble, but I emphasize this word here as it makes me smile and I often think ""I am one with the car"" when I drive this.  I drove in ice and snow with it for the first time earlier this week.  These were bad conditions and a 45 minute drive took me 2 1/2 hours and my Audi handled it like a champ, truly.  Other cars were spun off to the side and this vehicle stayed on track (of course I drive according to the conditions) and my car simply did it well.  As for complaints, I would say that being able to change songs on my MP3 or change stations on my radio ought to be on the steering wheel vs. the dash.  I also am waiting for my first oil change (soon) to have them do something to update my GPS maps as this car doesn't ""get"" newer construction and simply thinks I'm off-road at times.  But, aside from that, it is a joy to own and drive, so very quiet and I have to also say that not a week goes by without a stranger telling me it is ""so pretty"" and complimenting it.  Someone helped me out of a store with something heavy not long ago and stopped in their tracks and stated ""You have my dream car!"" and I did enjoy that.  Something is awfully fun about having people making a remark regularly about how nice the car is, I admit that.  I have never felt compelled to write a review before of any car I have owned, but I love this so much that I decided that I needed to share.  It is simply just a happy vehicle for me to own, I like happy!Updated, at Edmunds request at a few weeks less than one year of ownership:  I still love the car.  I'm still as happy as I was before.  It is a great vehicle and it is all the things I said previously.  I've not got about 18,000 miles on it.  People literally stop me in parking lots or gas stations to tell me what a pretty car it is, and I still love that.  I had an incident with the car where I avoided hitting a dog in the road (sadly it was running free) and hit a curb and destroyed a tire.  It needed a front end alignment after that.  Everything is fine, the vehicle handled an incident like that well and I was quickly able to adjust my driving and avoid hitting something.  It brakes well, handles well, does it all.As stated previously, my only less than perfect rating is the technology.  The radio is sluggish when you try to surf stations, not being able to change stations using the steering wheel is a negative on long rides.  The sound is good.  The GPS is ""old school"" and not a touch screen and it sometimes doesn't know where it is, forget trying the voice commands as it never gets what you say, even if it is said clearly.  An update of that would be $420 dollars at the dealership, so no thanks on that.  I have a previously purchased Garmin in the car and will use that for long trips at the same time as the navigation in this car as I now do not trust it.  One time I was in the car driving in Rhode Island and it literally placed my car out in the ocean rather than on the route.  That was truly bizarre.  Yet, 95% of the time it works just fine.  I need dependability for appointments and trips, so hence the need to have the Garmin on hand."
car_3057,Great ride - lovely interior - a few glitches,"Very happy with the car in general.  We use it both here in suburbia, and in our trips up the mountain to our home there.  For a 4-cylinder, performs well, with good acceleration and an extremely smooth ride.  The handling is amazing - like a sports car.  With the leather interior the cars smells so good!  :-)  The trunk is small-ish, so if you have kids maybe this is not the car for you - consider the Q5.  But it holds a LOT with the rear seats down if you have to haul something.  Minor quirk - I would have liked the adjustable steering column to have more adjustment down, as it sits a little high for me, even as a 6 foot driver.    Mileage:   On the highway, the indicator shows about 32 MPG - not bad.  But actual measurement is about 29 on the highway - surely a modern 4-cylinder can do better!"
car_3058,Audi Q3 rides like a NYC taxi!,After a year the shock absorbers are basically dead. You drive an Audi and it feels like a NYC taxi! I just did the 15k service at Audi But they claim the car is fine. Clearly there is an issue with this Q3. Buyer beware!!
car_3059,Audi does it again!,"Love the performance and the connection to the road, the logical interior layout and equipment without stupid extras . My biggest criticism is the height of the media/nav window that you cannot get rid of- cannot fold down or black out. I am 5' talk and it is right at eye level and VERY distracting to drive with, more so at night! If I cannot get used to it... It might make me reconsider the car- which I LOVE on every other level!!!"
car_3060,Safety crash tests,I am shopping for a Q3 or Tiguan or Jeep Cherokee. The Vw and Jeep show 5 star crash and safety ratings on stickers but I have not been able to find these test results on the Q3. I own a W Q5 and the rating is available What Gives Wudi
car_3061,Don't waste your money!,"This 2016, Audi Q-3, Prestige Quattro, is a nice design. PROS: The colors are great both Inside (chestnut brown leather) and Out (cuvée silver metallic). The car holds the road firmly and has a good ride. The steering is crisp and the breaking is excellent.  Headlights are awesome when driving at night on unlit roadways.  Seats are fairly comfortable with the Sport Package that was included as an option.  However, not nearly as comfortable as the seats in an A-4.  Sight lines out of the car are great.CONS: the electronics (Nav, phone, Wi-Fi) are a little difficult to get used to, but can be handled with some practice. Heated seats take forever to warm up.  Rear view camera takes too long to turn off after shifting back to a forward gear.  The only engine available for this car, 2.0 L / 4 cylinder / TFSI, that produces 200 hp & 207 ft-lb torque, is minimally enough for the car. And that's with just me as the driver.  If I had 3 other adult passengers in the car with me, the engine would struggle even more to get the car moving. The 6 speed transmission seems to do a good job, but could certainly use more support from the engine.  And, driving the car in the ""S"" gear to get the engine more power, forget about it!  The gas mileage would be terrible for a 4 cylinder engine.I think the worst part is that this same 2.0 L engine with 6 speed transmission is used in several other Audi models. But, they have way more hp and engine torque and even get way better gas mileage.  Unfortunately, this car/crossover/ SUV paired with this weak engine does not live up to the standards set by this brand's other proven models.   Quite the let down!"
car_3062,"Right size, right price, good dealer support","This is not a GTO! But, it's perfect for my wife who wants a very safe car with blind side warning, 4 wheel drive for a snowy Boston area uphill driveway and comfortable seating. Just the right hight to get in and out easily and still sit up a bit so you can see. The back seat is cozy, but easily handles two grandkids. Very quiet interior (compared to a Camry): all the technology requires re-education, but it works well. Not sure about maintenance costs, but initial reports are good and frequency of oil changes and the like are every 10,000 to 15,000 miles after a dealer paid 5,000 mile =checkup"
car_3063,2016 Q3 Prestige with Sport Package,"I recently took my wife's 2011 Q5 in for routine service, and the dealer gave me the Q3 as a loaner car. I was very impressed with the ride versus my 2011 A3 TDI. So when I went back to pick up my wife's car, I decided to sit down with a salesperson to discuss the possibility of trading in my A3. The deals they were offering were excellent, and I just wasn't willing to wait to see how Audi was going to resolve the emission issue affecting the 2.0 TDI engines.So far, I'm extremely happy with my decision. The Q3 with Prestige and Sport Packages is a real step up from my 2011 A3 TDI. The ride is extremely comfortable and the cabin is incredibly quiet. Incidentally, on previous occasions, I also had the opportunity to drive the 2015 A3 Sedan for an extended period as a loaner car, and the Q3 feels a lot nicer to drive. The handling with the 19"" tires included with the Sport Package is really impressive. It doesn't handle like an SUV at all. The car accelerates very evenly and the transmission shifts very smoothly. The exterior and all of the interior finishes are just beautiful! The Bose Audio system included with the Prestige Package sounds great, and I love how seamlessly my iPhone connects (via Bluetooth) to play all of my audio files. My only disappointment is the relatively poor fuel economy for an SUV in this class. In fact, the fuel economy is essentially the same as my wife's Q5 which is significantly larger and heavier. It's especially painful because I was averaging nearly 42 miles/gallon with my A3 TDI. However, it's unclear whether or not these fuel economy figures would have been impacted by whatever solution Audi/Volkswagen comes up with to meet the emission requirements.For me, it's the perfect compromise of size, comfort, quality, and luxury. I also considered the BMW X1 and the Mercedes GLA, but these two alternatives were significantly more expensive when comparably equipped. The Q3 is really an excellent value and I'm looking forward to years of driving this exceptional vehicle."
car_3064,VERY happy so far!,"Have had my Q3 for a month and am very pleased so far with the way it handles, how comfortable it is (got the sport package), and how smooth the car rides on Colorado's poorly maintained roads. Love the auto climate control and the cargo area is big enough for my bike which is why I wanted a crossover. It's fabulous and zippy on steep, curvy mountain roads. I'm averaging 24.5 mpg with combo city/highway (mostly city) driving. My only challenge is figuring out all the computer programs in the car and setting everything up to my preferences. The car manual has become my lifeline and I have to reference it often as it's a bit complex. The cruise control/radio/navigation/windshield wiper/etc. controls are pretty easy to access from the steering column but I find that I hit the wrong controls occasionally because everything is in one place. Huge learning curve with the car ( but then, my old car was a 2004 so I'm behind the times for car technology) but I have to say I'm very, very happy with it."
car_3065,A-6 replacement,"Got the Q-3 when my A-6 expired after 195,000 miles.  From my perspective its a great replacement.  Interior feels like an Audi - has space for my family of 4, but it cost less to insure, less to fill with gas, and cost a lot less than a new A-6.  My mother-in-law really likes the Q-3 because it is just the right height for  getting into and out of - the A-6 was too low and my wife's Land Rover Disco was too high."
car_3066,Great Car Would Buy Again!!,"This is a great car got it when my son was 5 now he is learning to drive with it. The cost to own is a little higher than say, a Nissan, but you are getting your money's worth with this purchase. I would definatley buy this car again."
car_3067,"The perfect ""wife car""!","I got this car for my wife, it's her 2nd Q3. Previously she had the premium plus fwd. Honestly if you compare it to the average small SUV out there, this thing is absolutely fantastic. She loves how it looks, it drives better than competitors due to the Audi Quattro. There is nothing like a Quattro Audi, I drive one myself as well and even if you don't get snow it's really nice the way it handles the road. The main thing about the Q3? It listens to the driver. Go try the x3 or the x1 or the lexus rx: they're great cars but they have a mind of their own. The other thing is that we got an amazing deal thanks to Edmunds forums. I found out the residuals and the money rate, I followed advice on how to shop and I got a really great deal. It's a premium plus with the sport plus trim, which makes it look even nicer than stock. Anyways, we love our Audis and as long as I can afford to drive them I will. When I can't I'll switch to VW."
car_3068,Absolutely Trust Audi Q7 TDI for Long Road Trips,"Best SUV, truck or car I've ever owned out of the many. Added running stainless steel boards and wind deflectors. Always serviced on time.  At age 74 comfortably drove accompanied with wife to Salem, Oregon and back from Atlanta, Georgia averaging 26.2 MPG over 8,000 miles...awesome torquewithout a maintenance mishap. Only challenge was finding correct diesel nozzle size for fill at truck stops. Not a biggie.Currently have 103,000 miles on odometer. Received loyalty card because of EPA over played hyperbole regarding clean diesel dispute. Expect new administration to put shorter leash on EPA gone wild. Used card for service. Thank you Audi. Overall my trust remains strong.Currently waiting for Audi emission settlement for 3.0 TDI. Really don't want to sell it back. Q7 remains bullet proof reliable."
car_3069,very nice CUV,"had this truck for about six months has less than 11,000 miles very fun to drive a tank this size like a sports car really drive great on the twisties, and off road - WOW i cannot believe some of the stuff i've climbed with this truck it just goes up dirt and mud road, will report back when snow finally falls in the Lake Tahoe area, igave a ""3"" for interior design cause a small spill on the MMi cost $1,100 dollars to replace, oh well no drinking in the truck."
car_3070,Favorite Audi yet,"I've owned 2 A4s, an A6 4.2l, an allroad, and an A5.  All good/great cars, but the Q7 TDI trumps them all.  Who would have guessed a car this big could be so nimble and so much fun to drive?  We bought it for the fuel economy and third row seating, but we love it for the way it handles.  We got the S-Line package -- think it makes the exterior that much cooler.  The Q7 also has a great interior, a great navigation system (you can enter the destination using voice recognition!).  And to think we were even considering a minivan..."
car_3071,Excellent Crossover,"I don't usually feel compelled to review a vehicle but with the 2010 Audi Q7 I could not help myself. I traded in an 07 MBSL550 and a '08 Lexus RX400h and the new Q7 is like both of those cars in one. The diesel is quiet and the power is amazing. Mileage so far is 23 combined, 21 city, 29 on highway cruising from Vegas to LA at 82mph.The biggest seller for me on the Q7 is the ride quality it is smooth like a Lexus but corners flat like a sedan. NO body roll and motion sickness. I drove the new MDX, MBML and X5 35 the Audi beat them all on total all around comfort and blended performance. The X5 was to hard to steer in parking, MB was pricey with no real advantage over the Audi."
car_3072,Love my Q7 TDI!,"I have had my TDI for about a month and I LOVE it!  I consistently get about 25 mpg on my commute, a mixture of stop and go highway and side roads. It has great power and I love the panoramic sunroof with electric shade. I had a chance to use my air conditioned seats the other day and let me tell you, what a great feature!  All in all, I am very happy with my purchase."
car_3073,From AMG to Q7,"Some thought I was crazy to go from my E55 to a Q7 but I really think it as a great choice. Mileage is 23 mpg, tdi power is plenty although a little slow the first second or two. Got the S Line w/21 inch wheels and the dynamic handling, so ride is not as soft as but the handling is great. As a long time MBenz owner (still own SL55) I think Audi is on to something. MMI is a pain compared to MB's system but I am learning."
car_3074,AUDI Q7,"I've driven BMWs for the last 15 years but wanted a change. I looked at Audi because I liked the styling and pretty much knew it'd be well built.  Pros: After 25,000 miles I still love getting in and driving every day. Great power, common-sense functional, simple and effective layout. Plenty of space, easy fold down seats and awesome looks inside and out. Full time 4-wheel drive really grips the road."
car_3075,TDI is a winner,"Just purchased the 2010 Q7 TDI a week or so ago.  Excellent build quality and impressive driving experience.  Averaged over 23mpg for 1st tankful, divided between city and interstate--- about 27mpg on interstate portion--- GREAT!!!  killer audio--mmi takes some getting used to but eventually makes sense.  Absolutely no diesel smell or lag and engine noise is negligible--- could be a game changer for US consumer acceptance od diesel.  3rd row seat for kids(or our grandkids!!) only, but the 1st two rows have plenty of room.  Love styling.  Only minor complaint is low overhead entering drivers seat.  Overall  a great vehicle---drives smaller than it is with excellent performance and mileage"
car_3076,The Everything SUV,"I love my new Audi. I wanted to upgrade from a mid-size/range SUV to something nicer that would hold more value. I love the body style not overly done and it gives me the power of a truck with the feel of a sporty SUV without all that annoying road noise. The flashy headlights won me over others. It offers uncompromising space in the back already having lugged several loads from Lowes with ease. Sure the last row seat to accommodate 7 is a little tight, but let's face it, if you still have full grown adults in your backseat all day you've got bigger problems not getting your kids out the house. The leather and finishes are luxurious as well. For the lady who wants it all enter Audi Q7."
car_3077,New 2010 TDI Q7,"I have put about 1000 miles on the Q7 so far. The diesel performs very well and is relatively quiet and virtually smoke free. My combined mileage, manually calculated from my first full tank was been about 23mpg.  When you are idling or stuck in traffic, the mileage really drops off.  I drove through a heavy rain storm last evening and as expected the heavy vehicle and all wheel drive performed flawlessly.  The ride and cabin accommodations are elegant and quite comfortable.  The large panorama sunroof gives the interior a very comfortable feel. The TDI is classified as an ""Advanced Lean-Burn Vehicle"" by the IRS and is eligible for a $1150 tax credit. Info is available on the IRS website."
car_3078,SUV of the Future,"I owned the '07 4.2 Q7 before this and really enjoyed the car but wasn't thrilled with the lower gas mileage (18.5mpg). I tried the Q5-good mileage but too small. The TDI is terrific-am averaging over 25 mpg on hway and city; over 28mpg on hway. Upgraded MMI (easy to use); LED lights; when parking, warning sounds for front and back bumpers (plus rear camera). Ride is smooth and quiet and excellent pickup from start. Small delay in engine start when turning key. For fill up, had trouble finding diesel nozzle that fit-many are too big. The electronic stability control is a great feature that really works-slows car down when going downhill in slippery conditions. It is a pleasure to drive this car."
car_3079,"Roomy, sporty and not a minivan","We just purchased the 2010 Audi TDI S- Line with the Prestige Pkg.  It was one of the first to land here in the US.  For reference, we traded in our 2006 Mercedes ML 500 - which we loved, but had many problems.  First of all, the Diesel is absolutely great.  It has the pickup of a V8 with the fuel economy of a V4.  With 14 miles on the car, I drove it from Houston to Dallas.  I averaged 28.9 MPG.  The gauge barely moved off off 'F'.  It is very roomy, drives extremely smooth, is very quiet and has conveniences that not only make it safer (i.e., side assist), but more enjoyable to drive. Also, the 3rd gen MMI is very easy to use and practical."
car_3080,"11 months in a fantastic little car, Audi 2017 Q3","Yes, this car could have used 50 more horsepower in the 2.0T model, however the highway mileage is a sensational 33mpg at 65mph (with 89 octane fuel)     It has a nice tight suspension with a super quiet ride. I was looking for a car for 2 years prior to buying this Q3 and am very pleased.   It has taken me from Key West to the mountains of Northern Maine in a confident, safe and secure way.    The down sides:  Be aware that the display is in desperate need of upgrading, the Pirelli brand of tire needs to be changed to Michelin."
car_3081,Wish I kept my base model 2011 Maxima,"I have never had a car payment until I purchased this car and I was more than happy to pay the large monthly payment when I considered all the ""upgrades"" and the luxury of driving an Audi.  I have had nothing much tech/mechanical issues since the day I bought the car. Overall it is a very nice car. Its stylish, it's okay on pick up (but nothing like the Maxima) the interior styling is very nice and the trunk/folding down rear seats are why I mostly wanted to upgrade to an SUV. However, the minor down sides eventually became so irritating I traded it in for a BMW Gran Turismo. The windows constantly needed the ""pinch sensor"" reset. which means my windows would roll up and then immediately roll back down. This happened 4x. I would need to call and either talk through it with a tech over the phone or drop it off for reset. My BLUEtooth never worked properly. Heaven forbid I answer a call while my 3rd party player was streaming music.... after the call ended I would have to reset the bluetooth system and again maybe play 2 songs before it randomly disconnected. My AC stopped working 7 months into owning the car. ( that was the last straw) The car is very nice, but it didn't wow me. Even aside from the minor issues....the tech package is bland at best. Certainly nothing I wouldn't expect in any other brand, luxury or not. Just did not live up to the luxury I expected from an Audi."
car_3082,Nice car,Does not have a touch screen!
car_3083,"Excellent Value, Great Car","First of all, I have owned a lot of cars. But, I think I found the one. I bought this car four months ago. I have the premium plus. So here is what I like: I love the feel of a luxury car. When I close the door, I feel closed off from the outside and it is VERY quiet, I like that. I love the leather, the style and the look of the car. The instrument panel is really nice. It's easy to understand and easy to operate. What I was really surprised about is the power and the handling of the car. It has more power than I am use too. That is not something I really look for in a car, but this one has it and I find that I really like it."
car_3084,Audi Q3 great fit for working mom,"Great if you need a smaller SUV, with style and luxury."
car_3085,I thought this would be a very safe car but NO!!!,"I just bought a brand new car for two months and only drive it for about 500 miles. The car unexpectedly started to shake and then flameout during the drive, I tried to restart the car but the engine light turned on so I had to pull to the side of the road and will ask road assistant to tow it to the dealer one week later. The Q3 is pretty outside and inside, I used to like it very much but now I regret to buy it. This car is totally unsafe and not reliable. What if this happened on the highway. Additionally, when I drive the car I feel the transmission didn't change smoothly. I can clearly feel a ""break"" when I release the gas pedal slightly. This is really a lemon car! I used to have a Volkswagon beetle and had really bad experience with it but now the new Audi has the similar issue. Very disappointed."
car_3086,2017 Audi Q3,Just purchased a brand new 2017 Audi q3. After two week's of having it and driving just under 300 miles the car is already back at Audi to get the engine worked on.. My wife was driving home from work when it started to shack uncontrollably causing her to pull to the side of the road. Thank god she wasn't on the highway at the time.  The car would not move without shacking. The car was towed to the for them to fix. The dealership was helpful and apologized of course. Never the less I find this completey unacceptable given the fact the we have to go threw this with a brand new car. Love the look of both inside and out but so far has not been reliable.
car_3087,Take care of your Q5 and it will take care of you,"First off, I purchased my Q5 with 50,000 miles 3 years ago and it now has 110,000 miles. I have done NOTHING to the vehicle except replace the break pads (front and rear) and put new tires on. My vehicles still rides like a dream and we absolutely love it. It floats on the roads and over bumps, and we are set on getting a newer model 2013 and up next. I have not taken my car at all to the Audi dealership because and I avoid them like the plague. I did my brakes at a local Belle Tire for half the price the Audi dealer wanted and I even change my oil at Belle tire and I run Amsoil Oil ONLY in my car. I have noticed my Q5 runs quieter with this oil than the actually oil the Audi dealer uses. Oh and i have the 3.2. which is much more solid than the 2.0. I hope this helps"
car_3088,Buyer Beware,"Audi's have a airbag recall.  We found out when we were trading ours in to purchase a new Lincoln MKX.  I called Audi and checked online and at this moment there is no fix!!!  And they have until December 2019 to find a fix.  So, we have decided to lose thousands and trade it in anyway.  I feel like we were robbed by Tanaka and robbed by Audi.  Buy American!!"
car_3089,Great car! Just take care of it!,"We purchased this car with 24,000 miles on it, and we have all the service records. The owners before us were very meticulous, and they had very few issues, and we have now put 6,000 miles on it and still have had no problems. The review that complains about having to replace the brakes at 30k is driving in the city constantly, I can tell because they also had to have the carbon build-up cleaned. Carbon build-up is a fact of life for direct injected engines, but when the car is driven at highway speed, the combustion chamber gets hot enough to burn off the carbon. Also, take care of your car. Change the oil with VW 502 00 approved oil every 5,000 miles, and keep up on scheduled maintenance."
car_3090,German engineered nonsense,"Instead of going into a long winded review of my 2009 Audi Q5, i will simply list the warranty work that has been performed thus far:- replaced center console- replaced water pump- replaced exterior HID light system- repaired gas lid- replaced rear hatch struts- removed engine for DE-carbon (3 full days)- replaced fuel injection- replaced steering rod & pumpNon warranty:- replaced brakes and rotors (30K)"
car_3091,Avoid this over engineered junk,"Beautiful vehicle and lots of fun to drive. Great interior. Excellent manners even on Illinois pot holded roads. Now the bad news. Quality issues from day one. Spent more time in the service shop than in my garage. Had issues with audio system, numerous unexplainable warning lights that pop up and go away on their own. Head gasket leaks after 6 months. I don't believe I bought a lemon. Seems many owners seem to have quality issues. Don't fall for the looks. I'm through buying over engineered junk from Germany."
car_3092,Complete Package,"I don't know what is happening with the people who are claiming to have such catastrophic problems with their Q5's.  I myself and two other acquaintances all bought Q5's last spring or summer.  Between the 3 cars, none of us have experienced a single problem with any of them, and I have put 16,000 miles on in the first year alone.  I had leased several Lexus’s prior, and was reluctant to change brands specifically because I was worried about reliability: I did, and have never been happier.  This car is gorgeous, comfortable and has more features than I could get in the Lexus for a comparable price- and as of now, the Audi is more reliable!"
car_3093,Many problems,This car was my first luxury car and what a disappointment.  Engine light comes on and stays on but dealer can't find a problem.  Air conditioner works sometimes.  Has a problem restarting when gassing up.  Service not what is promised in the sales pitch.  Would sell tomorrow if I could get my money back. My husband has driven several luxury cars without these kind of headaches.
car_3094,The Best,"Would like to see some reviews on 2010 model. Considered the BMW X3 & X5, VW Tiguan & Tourag and MB GLK. Decided the Q5 was the best bet. Have owned it for 30 days and haven't regretted my choice yet. Overall quality, fit & finish, drivability are outstanding. Negative comments in 2009 reviews seem to be fixed for 2010 (steering and tranny). Gadgets are mind boggling until you learn how to use the and then you learn to love them."
car_3095,Side mirror/ hatch back dr/ Cruise contr,"I enjoy my car and it is awesome looking but the side mirrors are too big to be point that I even had an accident because of them.1st time in 37 years and the hatch back door needs to be automatic in all models. Cruise control is terrible as it is an instant when you try to change the set speed. Other than that, all else is great. Dragonfly"
car_3096,Buyer beware of water pump issues,"I have been very happy with my Audi Q5 until today.  Had car towed into dealership after the coolant burst in the engine compartment.  I pretty much lost all coolant - luckily i was about to park it in the garage.  Found out today that the water pump failed at 7,800 miles.  It is covered under warranty but warranty or not this is a major issue.  I have so far seen a mass of posts with the same issue.  Fortunately for me the engine never had the opportunity to overheat.  Audi needs to address the issue with their current owners immediately."
car_3097,Q5 is best choice I could have made,Was driving an S-line A6 for past 2 years and while it was great it was too big for me.  The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5. That's what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip.  My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool.
car_3098,Transmission default,"Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds, this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it, I have a default transmission, and am not the only one, they have no right answers as how to fix it, they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears, and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles. That to me as a customer is unacceptable."
car_3099,Audi Q5 - Great SUV!,"My wife in on her second Audi (first an A4, now an A6). I'm the ""designated SUV driver"" in the family. I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano, which performed well and was a good value, but I've always been jealous of my wife's Audi(s). I looked at several mid-sized SUV's as a replacement, but none compared with the Q5. It drives like a sport sedan, with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV. The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces, but it feels very large inside."
car_3100,"Awesome, almost perfect, Audi","This car looks and handles great. It is fun to drive, has plenty of cargo space, and has a great sound system.  I came from a Mercedes with every bell and whistle imaginable and with this car, don't miss it.  I agree that the side mirrors are too big and take getting used to. I do also agree the the shifting of the gears when breaking can be a little jerky- I may just need to get used to it."
car_3101,Best In Its Class,"I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125,000 miles.  I love this new car.  It drives like a dream, a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV.  The interior is simply elegant (I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior), premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels.  My closest choice was the Volvo XC60, which is also a great car, but the MMI system on the Audi is just, well, cool.  The volvo's nav feels very old school and clunky. My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down, there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog's feet could get caught in.  Also, the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain."
car_3102,Great Ride & Performance- GPS lacking,"My 2009 Prestige Q5 rides like a sport sedan. Great acceleration (especially in sport mode), and responsive steering. I was really surprised on my first all highway trip (approx 75 miles), when I averaged 29.1 mpg! The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets. Great access to rear storage due to low entry. Seats fold easily. Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome. The GPS leaves a lot to be desired. The ""point of interest's"" do not let you choose ANY retail stores. Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot, Staples, Target, or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING. The restaurant search is a basic listing- can't choose cuisine- Italian, Japanese, etc. My $200 Garmin GPS is far superior."
car_3103,Audi owner,"This is my sixth Audi and the second SUV. Although I love the Q7, I didn't need one that big. I traded it in for the new Q5 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Audis are very strong and safe cars to drive; they handle the roads so well; especially in these New England winters. There is a sense of security when driving them that I have not felt with other brands."
car_3104,So thrilled,"Previous car was a Subaru 08 STI 5 dr hatch. Speed, agility, utilitarian use best describes our needs. STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads. So what was out there that would be fun to drive, quick acceleration, a great solid ride, not too fancy in appearance and interior, yet functional? My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions, this is how I came across the q5! In traffic, great visibility, amazing control maneuvering slow pokes. Quiet. An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build. Great turning into parking spaces. The vehicle drives and feels small. We bought the premium model, base with some options which kept the price down."
car_3105,Great Crossover SUV,"I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years. I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible.  I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage. The Q5 fits the bill. The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room. It handles great and I’ve been getting 25 MPG + at 75 MPH.  The cabin is quiet, the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good. This car provides great car performance with the functionality (functions you use 99% of the time) of a SUV. This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUV’s on the market and I can see why!"
car_3106,"Absolutely the ""best crossover"" now!!",Test drove many SUV / crossovers in this segment including X3 and RX350.  Hands down Audi Q5 won.  I have owned it now for three (3) weeks -and- the car is simply perfection in all aspects from comfort to performance.
car_3107,MMI Navigation/Audio annoyance,Do not buy the MMI Navigation/Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle. You have two choices when starting your car. 1) The display comes on and the radio/media begins playing. OR 2) The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio/media is off. Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio/media to come back on. You cannot start the car with the display and audio off. This is extremely annoying! I contacted Audi customer care. The representative verified this operation. I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it. There is no software/firmware update available to address this problem.
car_3108,Excellent Luxury Crossover,"Amazing ride, quality and craftsmanship.  Drove the X3 and XC60 and the q5 beats them hands down in all areas.  Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car.  My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus.  Bang and Olufsen, in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus.  Heated seats are standard but currently there isn't an option for Cool/ventilated seats.  They get really hot in the summer.  For a 40+ thousand dollar car, one would expect more standard options.  If there was a option to score on Value, i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs, Lexus, Acura."
car_3109,New Q5,"Took delivery of new Q-5 with Premium/Prestige Packages and immediately set out on 1,200 mile trip.  Vehicle performed almost flawlessly.  The GPS stopped functioning necessitating the rebooting of the MMI.  Q-5 held the road well at speeds to 80mph. Gas mileage averaged a whopping 25mpg.  Interior is well appointed. Everything about the Q-5 is solid.  The B&O stereo is without equal. This is a great vehicle."
car_3110,"Sporty SUV, Lacking Interior Comfort","I really love this car. I like the handling and the acceleration. There are a ton of features for the price. The only complaints I have are the gas mileage is kind of poor, and the leather seats are kind of hard and don't really hold you in them very well. The Navigation screen would also be better in a touch screen."
car_3111,Love this Car,"This is my first Audi and my first cross-over vehicle and I am thoroughly impressed with this car.  Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi.  Very good power for a V6, handles well and has a very smooth ride.  Great interior, good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic.  I've owned 2 Acuras, a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes (which I'll never buy again), and this car meets and/or exceeds those.  Better value for the $$ than the comparable X3 or X5 or Lexus or Mercedes.  Better features than the Acura RDX.  Really happy with the purchase and I highly recommend the Q5 for anyone looking in this class of cars."
car_3112,Q5 3.2 v6,I just bought 2 days ago. Engine is smooth on acceleration. A family of 4 can comfortably seat. I am having a blast. I love it.
car_3113,Bull in Sheep's Clothing,"With Audi drive select you can change its driving properties quite nicely.  With the ADS and the S Line tires and wheels (Michelin Latitude Sport). It will stick with the best of them. Comfort setting for potholes works well. Prestige package is worth it. Pricey, but a very nice ride!"
car_3114,I NEVER write reviews,"Okay, this is my first review on a car. I have previously owned 3 Lexus, BMW, Acura, and Toyota's.  This is my first Audi, had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed, so almost did not even look at the Q5. Glad I did, this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. Upside, engine is great, street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic, the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control, ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009.  Interior is extremely nice - I have nearly all the options so car price tag is $50k, which is appears overpriced at first, but when comparing quality interior and options is right on the money."
car_3115,Handles poorly in Town/City traffic,"Car has a serious issue with the gearbox. In start/stop traffic, the gear is either too low or too high. Unable to shift correctly. Jerky harsh ride in town driving. Fuel economy is much poorer than the stated."
car_3116,Impresive Audi,"The lease for my MB ML320 ended so I did some shopping around. I've tried Acura RDX and MDX and I had serious concern on passenger safety and lack of visibility. The same experience I had with Infiniti. MB GLK is really repulsive in design and BMW is still in the works to replace the outdated X3. Q5 was the best choice that I could have made. The design is outstanding, craftsmanship on the same level. Nice gadgets and the rooftop made my life so easy in convincing my wife: a 10 out of 10."
car_3117,I love this car!,"This car is such a big upgrade from our 2006 X3 (which we loved), I can only begin to describe it.  Comfortable, huge acceleration, great steering, excellent visibility.  Perfect car for our little family driving around the city.  Plenty of room for car seats, strollers, groceries, etc. and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town.  Little nits: side mirrors are too big, auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often, and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste.   But, I love driving this car.  Best car we've owned.  By far.  Including my BMW 328 (blasphemy!).   Compared the Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Lexus RX350:  this was a no brainer."
car_3118,Nice ride,"Excellent all-around luxury SUV.  Traded in our 2004 Volvo XC 90 (transmission problems). Looked at the Volvo XC60 and Lexus RX 350 among several others. After the dealer let us take the demo for a weekend we were sold.  The ride is far more superior and has many luxury features in a very attractive package, inside and out.  This car is just plain fun to drive and exudes quality. We are getting about 21 mpg overall (majority city driving)."
car_3119,Awesome!,"Owned 2 Mercedes and it was time for a change. We looked at everything in this segment. The choice was easy, the Q5 won the battle hands down. Only had the car a couple days and love it. Got the premium plus package in meteor gray pearl. This car is completely amazing. This SUV drives like a car and sticks to the road better than the CLK we just turned in. If you are looking for a small SUV look no further, you won't be disappointed."
car_3120,A clear break from the norm,"Premium Plus w/nav in Ibis White  I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5. It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive. Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST!  MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one."
car_3121,Best car ever!,"I've had more fun driving this car than any car I have owned and I've had several sports cars.  Put the transmission in ""S"" and punch it and it throws you back in the seat.  We test drove the Volvo, Lexus, and MDX.  This car was far superior! It was the only one that said, ""Buy me""!  Everything about it  screams quality and luxury.  We have been averaging about 19 mpg. I'm sure it would be higher if I could keep my foot out of it!  It's just a super fun car to drive! We have the Prestige model--- definitely worth the upgrade!"
car_3122,Wonderful!!!,I LOVE my new Audi Q5. Traded in a LandRover which was a major expensive headache. I have made a great choice... what a head turner. I strongly recommend the Q5 it is wonderful all the way around! I am so pleased with my vehicle!!!!
car_3123,Great Compact SUV,"Just bought a Q5 Premium Plus with Navigation.  Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want.  But Audi is now offering 2.9%, 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments, so net net it is like 0% financing + $500 discount.  The car is perfect for my wife.  The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK.  Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors.  My only complaint is the relatively small interior space, especially when compared to RX350.  Otherwise, it was perfect."
car_3124,Your choice is clear.,"My brother needed a new vehicle for work. He asked me for help. We researched and test drove all the competition. The Q5 was the clear winner. My local dealership had a hail storm and he was able to get his Q5 repaired and looking new for $8000 off the selling price (not MSRP). At such a deal I bought one also. His is black with tan interior and mine is white with tan interior. We both got the premium plus, but he also got the MMI package. No need for bigger rims or S- line for us. In two weeks he put 1500 miles on his Q5 and could not be happier."
car_3125,Outstanding Car,"Compared this car with other models and brands. Clearly ahead of the competition. Styling, interior room, sporty handling and more than enough power. Fuel economy as advertised. Loaded with technology. Was about to purchase an X5. After driving the Q5 and comparing space, feel and price, the Q won hands down. Great car!"
car_3126,1 Fun SUV,"We bought this car in April of 09 for my wife and I am ready to take it from her! The car is super fun to drive and especially so in the Sport mode. Has more get up and go than I ever expected. The transmission in the regular Drive mode can be a bit sluggish, but works fine. There is plenty of room in the car, I am 6 foot tall and the person behind me still has an adequate amount of room. Only had the car for a month now, but I am already a big Audi fan."
car_3127,Thrilled with my Q5,"I've had the car two months and couldn't be more satisfied.  I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 (still love that car) but the Q5 is more luxurious, more comfortable, smoother, better gas mileage, and just as fun to drive.   I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23.  The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver.  The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car.  Thru traffic, Manhattan streets, suburban highways and local driving, it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive.  And my passengers have no complaints either.  Thanks Audi!"
car_3128,Q5 is the only way to go!,My brother needed a new ride and after test driving all competitors bought an Audi Q5 premium plus w/navigation. I followed suit and bought a Q5 premium plus and could not be happier. I am a research junkie and hands down the Q5 beat out the competition. I look forward to many happy years of driving my Q5.
car_3129,Poor Gas Mileage,Beware of the ugly gas mileage.  I can only get the 18 mpg in the city on the vehicle instant mpg calculator if I am going down hill with my foot off of the accelerator.  It's stupid.
car_3130,Impressions of my new Q5,"I purchased my new Q5 from Audi of Oxnard.  I did extensive research prior to the purchase.  I wanted all wheel drive for skiing plus a place where both my surfboard and lab dog could fit.  I wanted comfort, bluetooth, nav, and pretty much all  goodies.  The full size moon/ sun roof is a cool addition. I replaced my 06 Acura MDX where the lease just ended. The Audi is extremely comfortable, with fit and finish second to none.  Smaller than the mdx, but still o.k. and with better mileage.  I got 23.5 on first tank, city and highway.  The center stack which controls the radio and nav takes some getting used to."
car_3131,Beats 'em all,"Test drove BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura and Infiniti. Audi is absolutely the BEST by far. The quality, craftsmanship, fit and finish is beyond compare. Got the Meteor Gray pearl, light gray interior &  Premium plus pkg. Have caused countless head turns on the road and while parked. Those LED daytime running lights really get everyone's attention. Precise handling; Superb ride."
car_3132,The perfect urban SUV,"We've driven the Q5 (with Premium Plus) for a month and we absolutely love it.  It's small enough for urban driving/parking, but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced.  Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car.  Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads.  MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving.  My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge. This is great for side visibility, but limits front visibility a bit when making turns, for example.  I think we'll get used to it."
car_3133,"""The best""","I have had 2 Mercedes (Ml320 and E320) and my Q5 is much better in everything, I traded in a 08 MDX that I bought because Honda and Acura reputation, but  I had to take the MDX 3 times to dealership to fix A/c and I recently discovered a noise on the transmission, so I decided - That's it!! and bought the Q5. I could not be happier with it."
car_3134,Absolutely Perfect! ...no comparison!,"I just bought the q5 with the premium plus pkg, and it's FANTASTIC! The gas mileage is better than advertised. The LED lights are awesome! It handles just like a vehicle, but with the stamina of an SUV. I am 5""4 and this car doesn't feel 'too large'. The interior is classy, and goes above and beyond all of the competition. I have been looking for a year for an SUV (MB, BMW, Lexus), and nothing comes close to the genius Audi put together with the Q5. I leased this vehicle, but after driving it for 2 weeks, I am quite certain I'll end up purchasing it @ lease end. If you haven't driven the Q5, add it to the top of your list, this is one vehicle that is a must drive!"
car_3135,Perfectly sexy!,Q5...truth in engineering equals driving fun. Sexy inside & out.Truly a head-turner! Behind the  wheel is perfectly engaging. Driving one is more than an ultimate experience. Q5 is the ultimate expression of PERFECTION! Owning one is a dream come true.
car_3136,Audi q5 premuim plus,"Been looking for about a year on a crossover that my wife & I would like. The Q5 has a very nice exterior look to it. The interior is comfortable for a person that 6'5"". The Q5 has more than enough get up & go to it. Gas mileages is not bad (19 mpg). Traded in a XC90 Volvo."
car_3137,Would Never Buy American Again!,"After trading in my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a 09 Q5 Prestige, I can honestly say i would never buy an American car again.  The Q5 is far better than the Jeep in every way, especially in the snow.  We test drove this car during a snow storm and wow, the quattro is amazing.  It would not let us fishtail or slide at all, and it just kept us going in a straight line.  Aside from that, the MMI is pretty easy to use, the Bang & Olufsen sounds great and the panoramic sunroof is amazing, the whole roof is pretty much glass.  Last but not least, the LED's both front and rear look incredible.  They were one of the main reasons I bought this car."
car_3138,Bullseye!!!,Traded in my Infiniti M35X.  Have always been a fan of Japanese car quality but decided to try a German car.  The school commercial captivated my attention as I was considering an Lexus RX350.  The commercial helped me to realize that I should try something not so main stream as there are a lot of Lexus RXs out there.  One test was all it took to blow me away.  The Q5 drives and feels like a sport sedan as handling and acceleration are excellent.  The build quality is phenomenal.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  The  gas mileage has been higher than advertised as I am getting just over 27 mpg on the highway (at 65-70 avg speed) vs sticker which claims 23.  You can't get a much better car.
car_3139,Prestige - S-Line,"I just recently purchased the car.  As an understatement, it is absolutely perfect.  Excellent engine response and handling.  The navigation system and audio commands are superior. I drove several competitors, i.e., Lexus X350, MB M500, Infiniti X35, and the Q5 is by far the best of the lot.  If one is looking for a high performance Crossover vehicle, I HIGHLY recommend the Audi Q5."
car_3140,Great car with all the features you want,"Traded our Acura TSX for an Audi Q5 and could not be happier with the choice. The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff. I would certainly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller SUV, a lot of fun, power and style."
car_3141,Can't Get Much Better!,"This isn’t going to be your typical car review. This one is taking on a new twist, it’s from the front passengers viewpoint. MS took driving away from me 19 years ago, but I’m still more than able to be the judge of a vehicles stature and quality. Back in 2001 I purchased an Audi Allroad. It was an exceptional car, and always a “head-turner”.  We recently traded it in on a 2009 Q5, and so far we have no regrets. The quality, detail and build is typical Audi…""First-Class"". Front seaters well over 6 ft in height have plenty of leg/headroom to spare. The 270hp V6 has enough punch to easily set you back in your seat. The shifting is very smooth and so is the ride. The Q5 also turns heads."
car_3142,Our Sunday Car,"My wife and I just purchased the Q5.  It was quite a trade up from a Toyota Corolla. The interior styling is far superior to its Mercedes and BMW competitors.  All three trims are great, and the Prestige is amazing.  All three trims have the same engine - which has all the power we'd ever need.  It has all the bells and whistles."
car_3143,Traded S5,"My wife and I traded our S5 in on the Q5 and honestly the quality and build is the same. We've owned the Acura RDX and Toyota's Higlander in the past this vehicle is by far superior. We have owned BMW's before and looked at the X3 we are glad we waited. This vehicle gives us some of the performance we enjoyed in the S5 without all of the attention we got in the S5,we get some but not as much.It also gives us the comfort of the S5 with greater cargo space. You forget you're riding in a SUV. We've only had it a couple of weeks, we'll stick with Audi.I miss the B&O :( ."
car_3144,Garbage in Garbage out,"So I am no longer a member of the Audi family. I owned my 2011 Audi Q7 for 6 years and for the most part it was alright. My biggest complaint is the maintenance. Every single service I had done was done at a Certified Audi Dealer, yet after 3 years the thermostat went out, exactly right after the warranty had expired. To make up for this, Audi did not pay for the repair, they did offer to cover my service through 75,000 miles. Fast forward 2 1/2 years and my 6 weeks after my 85,000 mile service my coolant light comes on and I take it back  to Phil Long Audi here in Colorado Springs. To my surprise the thermostat again needs to be replaced because it is leaking, as well as an additional 2K in suggested repairs. So 6 weeks after a service and an ""Audi World Class"" Inspection at  certified dealer, the car basically fell apart. I contacted Audi of America and they offered me a 25% discount on the Thermostat repair only as a good will gesture, what a crock. They do not stand behind there product as long as there is a buck to be made and I refuse to do business like that no mater how ""nice"" there cars are."
car_3145,We will never let it go,"My wife was first introduced to the Q7 in 2009 when her cousin came down from Boston in hers.  My wife fell in love with the drivability, the appointments, and it not having the stigma of elitism (buying a brand badge versus a quality car).  Most of the people we knew at the time had never heard of Audi.  Maybe because we were too poor to even afford one, but we all knew Mercedes and BMW!  My wife didn’t want to drive a badge, she wanted to drive a well-crafted machine that would last a long time.  A few years later, I found a lease return TDI Prestige in Florida that was well priced.  I jumped on it.Why really did we want the Q7 over anything else?  We wanted a 7 passenger vehicle.  There are only four of us in the family, but randomly we will transport friends to and from school and ball games.  So the third row seat didn’t need to cavernous, just legal for short trips.  We wanted a comfortable long distance vehicle.  We regularly travel 2,500 miles across the United States, so we desired something comfortable.  I’m 6’1” and many vehicles don’t fit me.  This fit me like a glove.  In these travels, we travel through all types of weather, including snow.  We also travel back roads a bit also, so we desired a four wheel drive.  We needed something that could tow a 5,000 pound camper.  And we desired 20+ mpg.  This wish list narrowed us down very quickly.  The Q7 was at the top of the list.With nearly 180,000 miles on our Q7, we have done NO major maintenance.  Brakes, oil, tires, battery and other small things like this; but we have done nothing major.  We continue to drive this car as our primary cross-country conveyance.  We have no squeaks, no rattles, no clunks and to broken nobs.  The seats have no tears, rips or bad wearing spots.  This car has really held up to my family.  It has truly held up to the price I paid for it.  Even my fuel mileage increased as I put miles on it.  Currently, we average 25 MPG on the highway, and around 18 in the city.The bad:The OEM brakes.  This is a heavy machine, and the brakes remind you that it is heavy!  Our first brake replacement, we upgraded the rotors and pads and reprogrammed the sensitivity of the brake pedal.  It made an immense difference.Tires.  This is a heavy machine, and it eats tires faster than a minivan.  I finally went to a Conti DWS with a 50,000 warranty.  This way, every time I swap tires at about 40,000 miles, I get $125 discount off the new set.  MMI  The interface with the computer is like jumping from Windows to Apple.  There is a lot of getting used to the strange interface.  My wife loves it, so I won’t expound on it!"
car_3146,First Audi and LOVING it...,"This is my first Audi and I'm really loving it.I've never owned a Diesel auto before but the gas mileage is great.But the fuel is more expensive so I'm not sure if it's not a wash by the time it's all said and done. Here in CA, diesel is at least 30 cents more per gallon for diesel vs. unleaded.The quality is great and I'm at 3,500 miles and not any problems at all. It runs smoothly and I'm averaging about 22 miles per gallon driving a mix of the city and highway (mostly city). I've averaged about 560 miles on a full tank of gas. The tank holds 26 gallons of diesel fuel.I test drove many different SUV's including Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, and a few others but none could compare"
car_3147,Excellent Family Car,"This Q7 replaces my 2008 A4.Q7 is huge.A lot of room.I love the 3.0 Supercharge engine with 8 speed auto.Pickup is very smooth.Mileage is OK. It does better than my 2005 X5 3.0i.It feels very heavy and during braking, I need to step heavier to stop it.I took it to the snow and it was fun driving at 70mph and passing other cars with chain.It is a excellent family car."
car_3148,Truly A Luxury SUV,"Finally broke 1k miles on my Q7. I along side of my 2002 audi s4 and 2004 audi a6 2.7t; the Q7 makes a great family SUV, I had custom dvd entertainment install and my kids loves it while on the road.  With a lot of mix city and highway I average around 20 mpg.  I tested droved the 2010 x5 with v8 setup and merc gl 550 both did not have the solid feel and quality interior.  The X5 was very responsive on the road and sporty while the Merc felt too calm and soft on the road while the q7 had the balance of both worlds."
car_3149,2011 Q7 3.0T Premium Plus,"Have only had our Q7 for 1000 miles now, but it's  been wonderful to drive. I traded in my 2007 Q7 3.6 and haven't looked back. The standard horsepower 3.0T has more than sufficient power and has more torque than my old 3.6 /gets 18 mpg vs 16 mpg in my last q7. It certainly isn't a rocket ship but rides smooth and handles very well for such a large heavy vehicle. The 8 speed  transmission is smooth and the rapid gear shifts are subtle and fast. To get the best gas mileage stay in D, switch to sport mode and the Q7 transforms it's feel very nicely if you want to attack a curvy back road or aggressively pass another vehicle on the highway. This is an excellent all around family vehicle"
car_3150,Great SUV,"I have had the car for only 2 weeks, but so far it's been great. For such a heavy SUV it feels light under acceleration, but leans a little in corners due to the weight. The 3.0T feels more responsive than the TDI. The torque in the gas engine isn't quite as good, but still feels like plenty. The gas engine feels more alive and is funner to drive.  It is very nice inside and out. However, some things like plastic interior door handles, cheap feeling engine start/stop button, make it seem slightly less expensive than a BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes. It still feels solid overall though.  Noticed a couple very small paint blemishes I have not had on other cars I've owned. Overall happy with the car!"
car_3151,Love mine so far,I received one of the first q7 sline trims in the Midwest. So far I love it. Drives like a sports sedan. Comfortable but now wallowing like other big suvs.
car_3152,"@ 3,000 miles","Traded in Allroad (wish they still sold that in US) for diesel - like the excellent mileage and lower emissions. Decision motivated by lower environmental impact. Compared to BMW X5, LR4, Lexus, MB BluTech. Excellent choice if you need space and winter surefootedness. Lots of torque, but it's a heavy car (noticeable in stop-and- go traffic). Drives very well - particularly on highway. Towing package did not include electrical harness - took a day at dealership to install. Major irritation is driver's seat position - simply too high for comfortable posture."
car_3153,My First Audi,"The Q7 replaced my Mazda CX-9, which comes off lease next month. So far I'm loving it. I test drove 10 different SUVs, and kept coming back to the Q7. Very pleased it's in my garage. Orca black with gray interior."
car_3154,Love my diesel,"My first diesel was a 1975 Mercedes Benz 240d.  Diesel technology has come quite a long way.  This is my second Audi, I did not think the A6 could be beat but Audi figured out how to do it.  Amazing family truckster.  Huge size but drives smaller than it is."
car_3155,Car I s good but repair is expensive,I Wii prefer to buy any Japanese car instead of German car.
car_3156,$ Bang for your Buck $,"I've owned and sold several Audi Q5's over the years.  I think the 2010 model type is one of the most dependable and overall well rounded versions of this car available.  the newer smaller displacement, forced induction engines with he 8speed transmission are nice, and the gas millage is better but the reliability is worrisome and costly.  Of course you should purchase ANY luxury/GERMAN vehicle with concerns regarding maintenance and price, because it will happen eventual on any make/model at any time.  Having said that, Audi's are by far the best value in class.  they are more sporty than their counterparts with a younger more sleek feeling.  The 2010 Q5 drive smooth and easy at low speeds, and is tight and responsive at high speeds.  the car feels as good to drive as it looks going down the road for thousands less than its competitors, or a new model for that matter.  buy one with a few miles for under 20K and you will have a good car for years to come, so long as you get the maintenance plan as well! very well put together, inside and out."
car_3157,Have enjoyed driving this car,Trade in and resale values don't hold
car_3158,My 6 year old 2010 Audi Q5 3.2 Totally Undriveable,"It's a beauty on the outside, but mechanically if you buy one anything can go wrong.  Sure my car had 91,000 miles on it and had Carfax Service records.  So far after owning it for only 6 months, it's already has had to have a complete front end re-done,  hoses replaced, they still can't figure out what's wrong with the steering that 'chatters' when you turn to the left that was $3,000 worth of work.  But what has happened now is that I was noticing the anti-freeze disappearing but no leaking.  The oil cap was milky which meant the antifreeze was leaking into the engine and you could watch it disappearing.  I had the car towed to the Audi mechanic.  The warranty I bought for $3,000 isn't worth the paper it's written on, they have loop holes in it so they don't have to fix it.  Basically the engine needs to be replaced.  According to the mechanic the engine is so difficult to disassemble and tons of man hours and dollars, it's easier to replace than taking it apart.  So now I have no car to drive.  I have over the years owned used cars from Mercedes to BMW's and have never had a problem with high miles.  This car is a joke.  My only resolve is to turn it back into the bank and then I will be stuck with the residual to pay for years.  Anyone have any ideas? Or heard of this kind of car tragedy? Update:  The dealership refuses to do anything about it.  The credit union can't do anything about it.  How can they in all consciousness sell you a car that is a lemon?UPDATE:The car ended up having $7k worth of work to get the thing running again.  It then started to over heat.  I had to turn the car back into my bank and I had to take a hit on my credit because of it.  I wasn't about to pay over $25k for a car that kept breaking down.  I called the Audi Corporate office, of course nothing they could or would do so Audi lovers beware, there are bad cars out there that will break you!  Other Audi owners of this model and make have made the same comments to me (I ask when I see one) no good engines in these cars.  I loved the look of it, the way it handled etc.  but their engines suck!  Thanks Audi for ruining my credit!!"
car_3159,Love my Audi!,"First time Audi owner and absolutely love the Q5. Great gas mileage, about 27 miles on highway with premium gas. No problems with the vehicle to date. Excellent paint job and easy to keep clean. Highly recommend this vehicle."
car_3160,Love my Q5,I have had my 2010 for a little over a year. I only had oneproblem with it and that was three weeks ago. The water pump went while I was driving. My husband came and had the suv towed on a flat bed to the dealer we bought it from. They told him they had no idea why the water pump went (not common on 3.2 engines). They told my husband to wait and fixed it right then and there.Now that is service. It is great on the road it hugs it. Great miles on the highway driving. I would buy another one in a heart beat. No regrets.
car_3161,Better than BMW,"I used to drive a 2008 BMW X5 and didn't like the performance, comfort, quality, reliability, etc. The Audi Q5 is more than what I expected, especially the way it handles the road on an extreme condition, the way it accelerates when passing, driving uphill is like driving on a straight road. The only thing I didn't like about the Audi Q5 is the way it drives under 10 mph. Overall, the best SUV I've ever driven, better than the BMW X5"
car_3162,"So Far, So great","I bought my Q5Premium Plus this month after going back and forth with the car dealer trying to get a better deal with the 2011's out.  I was finally able to get the vehicle at almost $4000 off the sticker.  I have only driven 1200 miles, but so far I love the vehicle. On a weekend trip, I got between 26-27 MPG which I feel is excellent. I suggest that you wax the 19"" wheels with a good wax. The brake dust will still show up, but it will wash off much easier.  Overall I will rate this vehicle a 10. I will write again in about 6 months."
car_3163,Audi q5 in a rain storm,Just got back from driving on route 91 in a terrible rain  and wind   storm. Today was another  example of why I purchased  an Audi SUV.  It holds the road so well and just feels very safe to drive; especially under bad driving conditions.
car_3164,2 months in,"I wrote an earlier review and don't have much to add; I thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and am very happy with the choice. I do have some observations: my wife, who is 5' 2"" drove my car one time and really disliked the oversize side mirrors as they obscured her view; I am 6'1"" and haven't had that problem so maybe it's an issue only for smaller stature folks. If I could change one thing it still would be opting for all-season radials instead of the summer performance tires. Also, a minor beef: the rear view camera takes a few moments to initialize so I find I'm having to wait after hopping in and cranking the ignition before I can begin to back up. All in all a great car!"
car_3165,Q5 exceeds expectations,"Purchased the 2010 Q5 about 5 weeks ago and this vehicle has exceeded all my expectations.  It rides and handles beautifully.  It feels very safe and stable and can stop on a dime. The interior is also quite impressive. It just looks and feels great. Really nice to drive after a long day at work.  Averaging 26 mpg between 20% city and 80% highway driving.  Overall, I would not hesitate to purchase another Q5 if anything ever happens to this one."
car_3166,New Q,"Just bought my Q5 a month ago and I love it. Very solidly built. I am really enjoying the ""Smart Key"" feature. I also am a fan of the MMI; though it's not really what I would call ""intuitive"", it hasn't been all that hard to adapt to. I love that I can make and take phone calls, navigate through the onscreen menu, adjust climate, etc, without having to ""reach"" for any controls. Complaints? It does seem to accelerate somewhat unevenly at very low speeds; room in the backseat is also tight--I'm 6 ft 1 in so when I drive, someone sitting behind me won't have much legroom---fortunately that rarely happens! GREAT looking car. I'll review again in 6 months."
car_3167,Hated Crossovers until this!,"I'm a sedan guy for a family ride, and when it came time for my wife to look for a new car I tried like heck to stay away from the SUV-Crossover segment. After driving the Q5 I have become a convert.  The Q5 is a wonderful driving machine, precise in its handling (once you get used to the size) and surprisingly good in the twisties.  Just got back from a road trip down to San Fran and I was very impressed.  The overall feel of quality and competence in the way the Audi goes about its business is flat out impressive."
car_3168,I've got a 3.0TDI diesel!,"Hey you guys in the US, I had to wait 6 months to get my 3.0TDI to Australia, and I can tell you at last that it was well worth the wait. The diesel power is very different to the 3.2 version. It comes as more of of a  surge, rather than the instant zippy power of a petrol motor, but when it surges, it just seems to keep producing more and more power! I chose this over the 3.2 because it is more economical and has even faster acceleration. (0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds. I won't add to the comments others have already made about the build quality and driving pleasure as I'm sure this has already been covered, just wanted you all to know that the diesel is a monster!"
car_3169,Awesome Audi!,"This is my first Audi and I absolutely love it! I have owned several other vehicles including BMW, Volvo, etc., and this car is far above the rest. If you are thinking of any other vehicle in this class, I highly recommend a long test drive and you will be convinced."
car_3170,Best Crossover SUV,"Traded in my BMW X5 and haven't looked back.  Eye catching exterior and interior design, comfortable ride, good acceleration exiting ramps, quality build throughout."
car_3171,First German Car,After years of Japanese vehicles I transitioned to that which I always wanted.  Was set up to buy an A-4 but wanted a little utility and was willing to compromise on performance.  So far very happy with features and performance.
car_3172,Audi Rocks,"Replaced my 2008 Honda Pilot. I had leased A4 in 2005 and was very happy with Audi as a brand. Great car/SUV. Love it, of course smaller than Honda Pilot but works for me."
car_3173,Positive German Experience,"This is my first German car and it's a great one - beautifully finished, good mix of power and economy, and reasonably fun handling.  I sold a Mini Cooper to upsize to the Q5 and don't regret it a bit.  The quality is first-rate and my wife feels safer in a larger vehicle with outstanding crash test results."
car_3174,The Best Compact SUV in the Market,"It was love at first sight!  From the moment I saw the Q5 I knew that's what I wanted and had been waiting for.  I had already made a deal on a BMW X3, but I was not 100% convinced that I liked the car, particular the stiff ride.  I drive a lot.  Every week-end I'm on the road and driving my Q5 is a dream come true!  It is just pure pleasure!  I love how the cockpit looks when it gets dark."
car_3175,Design flaw,"During snow or rain, when the rear hatch is opened, to gain access to the rear compartment, water, snow, dirt and salt build up in the drain channel and then run into the rear compartment. I've seen the mess run over the rubber seal. The dealer said they cannot do anything but maybe Audi will contact me and see if the problem can be solved. To date, no additional contact."
car_3176,Best SUV I have Owned,"I LOVE my new Audi Q5.  Its Comfortable, handles great and is so easy to drive.  No problems since I purchased.  Service Department is Awesome.  I will Definitely purchase another Audi for wifes next vehicle.  Thank you AUDI Great Job."
car_3177,Best crossover,"Replaced my 2009 Murano.  This crossover rides so much better. More responsive steering.  Handling around curves much better.  Quieter on the highway.  Less obstructed rearward view.  Interior much finer albeit a tad bit smaller.  The Audi doesn't quite match the cargo space of the Murano, but I don't miss it.  I do wish the gas mileage was a little better, but this is after all a crossover not a car."
car_3178,Star Performance,We recently purchased a 2010 Q5 Premium Plus at Classic Audi and absolutely love it. It handles very well and commands the road.
car_3179,Good car but not perfect,"Side mirrors are too big and create large blind spots.  I needed to take car in to have transmission ""reprogrammed"" in second week of owning the car. otherwise, Q5 is a good car."
car_3180,New Audi Q5 (Premier) first impression,"I have had my Q5 for one month (1300 miles).  Moved up from 2005 Subaru Outback XT (turbo).  The car feels bigger than it is (probably high hood), but the handling is superb. Nice turn radius, positive/stable in twisties, and smooth/fast acceleration.  Steering feels 1:1 and no issue.  Noted comment on hesitation from stop to start; haven't experienced this. Shifting smooth all the way up; sport mode is RESPONSIVE. Interior is beautiful. MMI and voice work, but there is a learning curve: reading instruction book helps!  It is more expensive than the Suby (for the money, very good value). But if a luxury compact SUV is your thing, then the Q5 is an excellent choice; I highly recommend the Q5."
car_3181,Audi-be better,"Beautiful car but has flaws... 1) The navigation system:  does not allow searching for a restaurant type.  for instance you cannot ask for Chinese, Mexican or Italian food - you just get a list of restaurants that includes everything from ""taco bell"" to ""chez panesse"". 2) The brake pads spew dark dust that spray the side of the car daily.  There are no mud-flaps to prevent overspray from the front wheels so the side of my car is covered in break dust from the wheels daily. 3) Who uses dvd's? Get rid of the dvd player. 4) Who uses an ashtray? Get rid of the ashtray or at least make it larger so it can be used to hold a cell phone or business cards - its a useless space."
car_3182,Good Car,This car is wonderful. For a car this small you think it would be cramped but it's not. A definite buy
car_3183,Exellent Vehicle,"I have driven lots of cars, and this one takes the cake. Handling and overall performance are better then my wife's A4, and it has much more cargo capacity."
car_3184,Fun to drive & different among the crowd,"I purchased the 2010 with the prestige S line package. So far I love to drive it and there are no problems.Only difficulty is operating the MMI. But once you get used to it, it's not too bad."
car_3185,Best Car ever,"This vehicle is the pinnacle of luxury. It outperforms anything else I have driven. Its ride is unique, firm but smooth at the same time. It's a definite buy."
car_3186,nice driving poor reliability,"When I bought mi Q5 prestige, I was very happy but all the problems started.A/C broke down twice, dealership had to replace to parts on both headlights,leak on the transmission etc etc.Nice looking car, fun to drive POOR RELIABILITY. TRADED IN FOR A LEXUS."
car_3187,Audi Q5 front LED light broken 3 times,"I am reporting review AUDI Q5  (year of 2010) because the front daylight headlight running sets problems, I purchased an AUDI Q5 in 9/23/2009, it happened 3 times of front headlight daylight running sets broken in 5 months, my car's current mileage is only 5700 mile, which is apparently not the LED headlight quality problem, which is highly possible on the electrical problems, now I am waiting for AUDI's response to see they will treat it as a lemon car case or not."
car_3188,Great SUV,"I had a Q5 Premium plus with S-line package, had this vehicle for almost 2 weeks now & I will say that this is the best car I ever had. Day time running LED lights makes a cool stylish appearance. Ride is great & quite, car keeps on lane with very little steering effort. Interior fit & finish is excellent. MMI nav is not really user friendly, but once used will be ok, would love if have touch screen.. The display on meter shows the songs list & tel numbers without interfering nav screen is great. I would definitely recommend any one looking to buy a compact SUV to drive this car."
car_3189,Great Car!,"We drive our Q5 in the LA area and love it! It's good looking, quick, quiet and fun!"
car_3190,Great SUV,"This is by far the best SUV in this size and price range. We test drove the XC60, RX350, GLK350, X3, SRX and the RDX. The Q5 comes out on top quality wise."
car_3191,Very nice with a few caveats...,"Overall, the Q5 is a wonderful driving experience. I live up north and it handles extremely well in the snow. Very comfortable and pleasant to drive.  However, there are issues. The nav system, although nice looking, gives unreliable directions. I use my $180 portable instead.  And the key. How do you screw up an ignition key?  The MMI (multi media) system is nice but forgets your settings. Stupid things like always having to tell it to ""shuffle"" the music - every time you use it it requires 4 clicks. It also forgets your seat heater settings. Also, with the MMI buttons on the middle console, its very easy to accidentally touch one.  Why doesn't it have a touch screen???!!"
car_3192,"Wow, really the best car!","WOW, what a terrific vehicle. I read a review before buying it that claimed it was the only SUV that truly drove like a car unlike others who claim the same, and I agree. It is very fun to drive, got hit with many snow storms this winter and I just drove right through everything with no problem, passing other struggling cars. Handles great, comfortable ride, technology is convenient. I have the Prestige package, fully loaded, and I don't regret spending the extra money. Its a beautiful car and I feel good about myself when being seen with it (as shallow as that sounds) I have the Luxury package with the Milano Leather and ventilated seats, which I cant wait to try in the summer! BEST CAR"
car_3193,Very Strange Experience So Far,"The car runs well, but when we brought the car in for the first service we were told the water pump had a leak and they had to replace it, but it needed to be ordered.  When they received the part we brought the car back to the dealer and they replaced the water pump but then told us there was a small leak in the transmission and they said Audi told them to replace the transmission.  Went back when they received the transmission and they replaced it but then they said it was programmed for a diesel and had to order another one.  Next one came and same problem.  Now we are waiting for the 3rd transmission to arrive and the car has been there for 2 weeks.  Still waiting for my car."
car_3194,Buyer Beware,"Audi Q5 is a great vehicle as long as you do not drive under 10 mph, I have a major transmission issue, 3rd replacement in 2 months, Audi corporate will not stand behind their products and work with you to satisfy yourself as a consumer, my vehicle has lurched and hesitated when coming to a stop causing 2 near accidents, I have never experienced such poor customer service form a corporate and a dealer standpoint, they act like it is my fault there is an issue, you have been warned!"
car_3195,Just Plain Fun to Drive,"I purchased the prestige S-line model, and love it.  I was looking at the RX350, RDX, XC60,etc.. and this beats them out of the race.  The car is awesome looking from the outside and has all the gadgets to keep you happy. It is more masculine so guys can drive this feeling good and I get alot of looks But best of all it does not feel like you are driving an SUV but more like a car.  Space is just right, but if needing to hall more stuff in the hatch, then this may not be for you, but if your getting around town, taking kids and going to work this is perfect."
car_3196,"Premium plus, really nice","Nice car.  Interior design and quality are substantial.  Handles exceptionally well.  Power is faultless.  Gives a feeling of total control over driving experience.  Stock stereo with satellite radio is outstanding.  Love that everything is lit at night, no fumbling for any controls.  Easy integration with cell phone and i pod, voice commands work, nav. controls are confusing at first, but get better over time.  There is still lots to learn about how to get the most out of the electronics.  Roof rack is exceptionally easy to put on. A long list of suggested improvements, but still a killer car."
car_3197,Great pick if changing from coupe,"I changed from a Honda Accord coupe into the 2010 Q5 Premium Plus model with the S-Line package.  I love the smooth ride, the quiet of the engine and the ability to pick up speed quickly.  As for changing over from a coupe to a crossover, it has been seamless.  The car is nimble, parks in standard spaces yet feels a lot larger when on the road.  It also offers great general visibility from all sides.  I didn't get the optional side assist feature, but still feel great about the views I do get."
car_3198,Awesome,"I purchased this vehicle a week ago.  The driving experience has far exceeded expectations.  The AWD keeps it glued to the road and the acceleration is very good.  Acceleration from 0 to 20 MPH is not fast, but after 40 MPH, acceleration is sports car like.  This is my first SUV and I was concerned about driving fun.  However, the high up seating position affords excellent visibility, the Q5 handles like a car and it is an overall fun ride.  I compared this to the RDX, XC60, RX350 and am very satisfied.  The Q5 is a luxury SUV/car, that is just the right size.  The Audi cockpit and attention to detail can't be beat.  Also, the Q5 has plenty of room for the wife and kids."
car_3199,Excellent,"The interior is outstanding and the handling has been a pleasant surprise. It has the right amount of firmness and handles hills and acceleration beautifully. I am thoroughly impressed. The only negative comment I have is about the iDrive feature or whatever they call it. I was pretty proficient in the BMW iDrive and came to like it. I hope that I will eventually learn to navigate my Audi's too, but so far it has not been intuitive. I think I will come to like it but it is going to take a few weeks to get used to it."
car_3200,A Great Car!,"I picked up a Black Prestige a few days ago. I own a Volvo XC90, but handling in the Q5 is far superior, as it drives as a sports car. We had a massive snowstorn last week, which has made roads slippery and icy in Wisconsin. I am very impressed with how the Q5 handles the road under these conditions.  Regarding the purchase, I was between the Premium Plus with Nav and Prestige Packages. I went for the Prestige and paid the extra 3K, but I think the only accessory really worth the extra cost is the side-assist (only available for Prestige). I think the B&O Stereo is overrated. Overall, I am quite happy so far."
car_3201,This car has it all over the RX,"This car has it all over the RX. It has better electronic gadgetry, handling, design and is a blast to drive. The seamless bluetooth integration with my IPhone was totally painless and automatically took all my contacts without even prompting me. The voice recognition is excellent and I can call people without taking my eyes off the road as well as enter a destination. The quattro drive system is awesome and the LED daytime running  lights are very cool. The seats are very comfortable and lumbar support is fabulous. Great job Audi."
car_3202,"Best by features, Worst by reliability",2010 Audi Q5 is good vehicle but reliability is sub par. I bought my Q5 in August 09. I had jerks with upshift and downshift due to improperly installed transmission filter which apparently was a factory defect. The convenience key also quit working and they had to change the whole convenience module. They fixed it all under warranty. When I called Audi they offered me a mere 5000 miles extension on warranty or $250 cash (for a $53000 car!!). Looks like they do not trust their own product. I am just frustrated that I have been sold a defective product.
car_3203,This Was A Good Decision,"Just picked up my Q5. This is the first luxury SUV that I've owned. The last time I experienced quality like this was when I owned a Jaguar. The ride is terrific. It's solid, responsive and absolutely a ton of fun to drive. Audi has combined looks, performance and fun in their 2010 Q5! I've started reading the owner's manual to get up to speed. There is a lot to this car and it will take awhile to understand all the bells and whistles but it's worth it. I bought a Meteor Gray (great color) Premium Plus and added 19"" wheels and the B&O stereo. I'm looking forward to driving this vehicle for a long time. Test drive one of these and you'll see that Audi has it all over Mercedes, BMW & Lexus."
car_3204,I LOVE My Audi!!!!,"My husband and I sold our 15 year old BMW 530 and bought this wonderful vehicle.  I drive it most days and just love it. It's not too high, so I don't feel like I have to step up to get in to it.  It's so fun to drive, I'm getting in to work early because I can't wait to drive it.  I can't find anything about it I would change.  The mileage is great!  Where has this vehicle been all these years!  I'm sold! I'm quite sure I'll never drive anything else."
car_3205,Audi Q5   Performance-ride-quality,"Ordered our Q5 Prestige Pkg Audi on 27 Jul and on 3 Nov it arrived. The Q5 was worth the wait! Get the S-line pkg. The 20 inch chrome wheels put the finishing touch on this black beauty.  This is a great looking SUV with the best handling, ride, and appearance of all the mid-size SUVs (BMW/Lexus etc). Try the Q5 if you're tired of seeing yourself at every traffic-light and/or parking space. My wife loves the way it handles and rides and the engine has enough power to satisfy her driving habits. I've owned other Audi's making us qualified for a $1K loyalty discount. It has a first class dynamic 505 watt sound system. The Q5's Quattro suspension system is like nothing you have ever driven."
car_3206,Unique Design Separates Q5 from the Rest,"This is my very first car.  My previous car was a 1997 Honda SUV that was handed down to me by my parents in 1997 when I was a teenager.    Interior: A+  Amazing.  Largest panoramic roof in its class.  Great finish compared to other luxury SUVs.   Audio: A+  The MMI interface allows you to control your Ipod on the MMI 6.5'' (I think) screen.  Very useful.   There are also 2 more speakers, 2 more than other luxury SUVs.  Performance:  Drives like a sports-sedan.  A+  Uniqueness:  Hardest car to get in North America (Forbers article).  Day-time running LED lights.  Design and style is different than other ""BOX"" SUVs.  Beats comparable SUVs like Lexus, X5, X3, Acuras, etc."
car_3207,Exactly what I was looking for,"I was coming down from a larger SUV and forgot how much fun a car could be to drive and I picked the perfect vehicle to remind me of that.  Performance transmission gear sends you off like a rocket, tight handling like a sports model and a great exterior make this price the deal of the year.  My family of 5 fits comfortably.  Not a lot of cargo room, hopefully future designs will take that into consideration.  Only complaint is difficult-to-use navigation system and it doesn't always take most efficient route (but still worth getting)."
car_3208,Little big Audi,"Great car to drive for short and long distances. I drive it during great traffic hours via NYC and it is fantastic! Car handling, design, interactive navigation, great stereo as well as huge sun roof are fantastic. I had BMW sport wagon and there is no comparison, as Audi is much better."
car_3209,Awesome Xover,"What an awesome vehicle. Only owned one foreign car, an Accord. Was shopping for several xovers and fell in love with this vehicle immediately. DO NOT test drive this beast, otherwise you will love it. Handles like a sedan and I haven't yet broken in, so I've only touched the surface of this Q5's potential. Heard people say Audi's were nice but never really liked any of their sedans, except for the TT. If this Q5 is decently reliable, I'll be an Audi purchaser again. Love my Q5!!"
car_3210,X3 not even close,"Owned a BMW 325XI for 4 years and needed an SUV. Drove everything in the class, X3, VW Toureg, Nissan Murano, Toyota Highlander Mercedes etc and nothing at all comes even close to the level of refinement, exterior looks, interior (Audi sets the bench mark here). 270 Bhp, stunning LED daytime running lights, adequate usable space with the seats folded down. My wife absolutely loves it and made quick work of her first Costco run in the Q5 easily loading everything into the back with a smile on her face. (happy wife, happy life). Too bad the 3.0 TDI that is in the Q7 is not available in the Q5 at this time."
car_3211,Sweet Ride,"Wow!  My Audi Q5 was delivered on Monday & what a sweet surprise!  I had bought it sight unseen and w/out a test drive... I am impressed!  The ride is smooth, it handles like a dream!  The interior is classy comfortable & has enough bells & whistles to thrill any technophile!  The Navigation is easy to use, bluetooth simple and the look is perfect!  The panoramic sunroof is impressive providing the feel of a convertible!  The exterior is beautiful with nice design and a sleek sexy look!  This is a driver's dream in a mid-size SUV... Look out Lexus and BMW, there's a new kid in town!!!"
car_3212,Beautiful,"Just had my Q5 for one week.  Perfect blend of performance, luxury and practicality.  Love the engine sound and the way it handles, except when I'm listening to the incredible B&O stereo.  Can't wait to get through the break-in period.  Still figuring out all the electronic controls.  Love the bluetooth phone and ipod controls.  Can't wait to get through break-in period and let her rip."
car_3213,A fine automobile,"My few issues with my Audi are that it's not as quiet a ride as I would hope, especially on the highway: too much air & road noise, so that listening to music is moot. Of course, when you're driving long distances (on highways) is when you want to listen to music!  There is also a hesitancy when trying to enter a highway from a stop or slow speed - you jam the gas pedal to the floor and the engine takes a couple seconds to respond.  Like it's saying to itself, ""I think he wants us to go now, so let's get going.""  Not good.  Once engaged by the transmission, the 2.0 has enough pickup, so it's not the engine.  It's the transmission engagement that is slow. Lastly, it used hi-test gas (91 octane or higher), which makes it more expensive to run, as it only gets around 15+mpg combined.    That all said, it is a very well built automobile in materials, construction, and detail.  Most certainly better quality automobile than ANY of the Asian imports.  Oh... yeah... it stops on a dime!"
car_3214,Don't hesitate to buy this diesel.,"After one year with this 2015 Audi Q5 TDI , I have only one word...incredible. I've never owned a diesel car before...the combination of power, torque an gas mileage cant be beat. Most Americans are now leery of Audi diesel's ...perfect ...they don't really know any better. Go buy one at incredible bargain rates. This Audi diesel is by far the best selling model throughout Europe, and for good reason. This sophisticated and quiet diesel engine is pure Audi ...through & through. The use of ""ad blue"" fuel treatment totally reduces any emission concerns ... this engine is way more sophisticated and clean burning than the 4 cylinder VW engines that have been in the news."
car_3215,Very nice crossover,"3.0 V6 is notably quicker, smoother, quieter than the four cylinder 2.0. Unfortunately, like most German cars, the engine size drives the price up!  But the engine usually accompanied by a couple of other ""nice to have"" sport features help you rationalize the difference.   I've always been a ""coupe"" guy, but in my current situation, I'm drawn to a moderate sized cross-over SUV.  Therefore, I wish it had a little smoother ride and less body lean in turns.  However, I'm quite pleased with my choice of the Q5, but now wonder about an SQ5.  Nicer yet!  Waiting on new model update expected in 2018."
car_3216,One Year Review,"The Audi Q5 was my dream car, and I was very impressed with it for the first few months. It has been about a year now, and I have less than 9000 miles on it, but I have slowly become less fond of the vehicle. I have had a rattle in the driver's side door fixed once already, but it has come back. I have another rattle coming from the cargo space cover, that makes noise every time I go over a bump, such as speed bump or when pulling into driveways. There also seems to be another rattle coming from the seat belt mount on the driver side. The sun visors will not stay up when moved up to the windshield. Living in Florida, I use the visors daily, but the quickly fall about 2 inches when put them up, which Audi has told me is ""normal.""  I have owned Chevy, GMC, Mitsubishi, Kia and Jeep, and have never encountered a problem with the sun visors staying in place.     It also seems that Audi has gone out of its way to ensure that the base model ($42,000) has as few features as possible IE: radio and electronics. Radio presets can only be operated from the dashboard, not on the steering wheel, and no back-up camera, which is basically standard on all vehicles in this day and age. Overall, I don't dislike the car, but I doubt that I will spend the money on another Audi once my lease is up. I know some of the issues are petty, but for the price, I suppose I expected higher quality."
car_3217,The perfect little SUV!!,"Very nice car, not to big, not to small. Very quiet inside, very good power, nice tight car!  We tested others like Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes Benz, Honda and the grand Cherokee, for our needs, the Q5 was best, and for all the extras, price was good."
car_3218,Q5 Large mirrors causes driver blind spots-,"I am leasing this car.  It is my first Audi.  My husband loves his Audi so I thought I would try one after driving a Mercedes GL 450 for 2 years.  It has only been 2 months. and I hate this car. My 2  biggest complaints.  The side mirrors are HUGE.  So big, that it causes major blind spots. Very dangerous.  I have seen many complaints of this issue online and disappointed Audi has not responded to fix. When you are at an intersection, making a left, the mirror will cause a blind spot to the cars (median or island) of the street you are entering. I would not buy this car because of this safety issue.   The sensors in the front and back of  the car  are also way to sensitive and will start to beep when are you are no where close to hitting something.   So sensitive,  I find them to be more of a distraction and ignore the beeps.  So what's the purpose when you start tuning it out?"
car_3219,Audi Q5 2015 TDI,"I purchased this SUV with 14000 miles on it and got a fairly sizable discount from original sticker from the dealer.   I have owned three BMW 535I (one was a 530) previous to this vehicle so I am know what I am talking about performance wise  as two had Sport suspensions.  This Audi does have all the upgrades including the 20 inch wheels and handles extremely well for a smallish 4500 pound SUV.  The acceleration of 6.5 seconds to 60 is amazing for a diesel that has ranged between 30 and 39 miles per gallon so far. I have noticed that the temperature conditions affect the mileage which must be a diesel thing but recently I got 39.5 MPG driving to Chicago on a 70 degree day going Northbound maybe I had a tail wind who knows.   In summary the handling, acceleration , and mileage are ABSOLUTELy splendid.  Certainly some of the 500 HP sport model SUV's are faster but who wants to own a vehicle that gets 15MPG average?I have not had one issue after four months and 9000 miles and  the car is extremely quiet under highway driving conditions.My only complaints are the short warranty period of 50000 miles accompanied by 2600 in ""regular maintanence""  costs  and the center console which impedes the movement of my right leg a bit. The lack of a few  electronic options is really nothing I can not live without like I need more distractions while I am whipping down the highway.  I will let you know if anything goes wrong I am hoping to actually be able to drive a German vehicle for 150K carefree miles which was impossible with a BMW. I can not imagine an Acura or Lexus handling anywhere near as well so if you like performance with economy the TDI is the wave of the future."
car_3220,Multiple Repairs over the First Year.,"Purchased the car with 2000 miles on it.  At first drove like charm.  Within 2 months, front grille peeled requiring replacement.  Three months later, needed another grille due to peeling.  After this repair visit noticed shuddering and bucking with acceleration on inclines.  Took car in and was told needed a new fuel injector.  The car had less than 15000 miles.  Injector replaced.  Took car from dealer and before I could get home, problem started again.  After exam was told was fuel related and should try different stations.  A month later, after trying every station in my city, problem still existed and took car back to dealer for closer look.  After several days of exam, car was diagnosed with severe carbon build up in engine.  A shame such a nice car has so many issues. I'm done with Audi."
car_3221,"Great Ride, but a few issues!","I have had my 2015 Audi Q5 for about a year now, replacing a 2009 Acura RDX which I loved.   The Audi is beautifully finished, and an extremely comfortable vehicle.   I have had minor issues with rattles and noises, including having to change the hinges on the rear passenger door.   In also long for some of the technology that I had in my 2009 Acura, like knowing the tire pressure in each tire.  I also find the blue-tooth entertainment system unfriendly to use, and the audio response quite poor.   Frequently, the numbers are wrong.  You can say ""six"" and end up with a seven in the number.  Handling is good, though the electronic steering takes some time to get used to.  I miss the tightness (& lower body roll ) of the Acura, but over time have gotten to where I really like my Audi.Last, for a 2015 model, the interface with your mobile phone is horrid.   The Hyundai Sonata  unfortunately has a better interface than the Audi.   If you are looking for a good, comfortable car, this one is for you.   If you are looking for ""technology"", the Audi may not be your vehicle."
car_3222,I LOVE MY AUDI,"Female, in my early 20's and I love my Audi Q5! I have put a few thousand miles (still under 20k) on this Audi so far and bought the Audi Care with it, brand new. I love the sound system, the navigation system, the buttons, the lights, the controls, the handling, and the traction. The performance on sport mode is phenomenal, I hit over 120mph and it handled amazingly well at such high speeds! I have drove it through rain, gravel, grass, dirt, not *yet snow.... Excellent handling! Very sleek and fancy interior, my favorite thing is the sunroof. I don't have any kids, but I would assume the back seat is average, not large or too small. I travel a lot, it goes for an average of 450 miles before needing another fill up. There is so much technology I have yet to figure out everything, but the more I learn the more I love it!"
car_3223,I wish I had stuck with the Acura,"The car seems to ride OK  except for the steering wheel which seems very loose.   I find it particularly difficult to control in high winds  or at high-speeds.  The acceleration is fantastic  as is the breaking.   The ride is sort of smooth but the tires don't seem to provide much in the way of comfort than you would expect. For the price point of this car, the stereo system is abysmal.  It is like listening to music in a tin can.   My mistake was not checking that out before hand.   Assumed it this day and age and at this price point that he would be as good as the Acura's. When I took it in to find out if there is anything  I was so much is told that it can't compare.   So I took it to an expert who told me it would cost me no less than 1500 to make it sound halfway decent.  The whole navigation system seems OK just a bit complicated.  Making phone calls is equally complicated.   I'm going to wait until I get a few thousand more miles on it and then I'm going to trade it in.   I would not recommend this car  particularly for this price."
car_3224,"Cheap interior parts, avoid vaccum","I've been a Ford owner for over 30 years from sedans to pickups very satisfied. First Audi Q5 bought with 30,000 miles on it now has 80,000 a year later to give you an idea of the miles I Drive. Overall was satisfied until had an issue with a vacuum ripping off a part on my console. Audi will not sell me that individual part for $20 they bundle it with the entire consol for  $300 dealer said it was my problem to go online and see if I could find the individual part itself. I then called the national Audi customet service and did not get any better service there. very disappointing. I won't own another Audi. Im going back to Ford or Lincoln. Someone should buy the senior management team at Audi copies of the book raving fans their customer service is horrible"
car_3225,Q5 TDI Perfect family crossover,"So far with 7500 miles the Q5 has been great. Plenty of power, great gas mileage, very comfortable around town and on the highway. Good value for cost of ownership. Hope to keep it in our family for a long time."
car_3226,Audacious Audi,"The vehicle at this point (4K miles) exceeds my expectations ! The drive is excellent and the interior technology is well crafted and fun. My take on the car is that I've purchased an SUV, with all the advantages of cargo space, passenger room etc.,that performs like a sports car. The panoramic roof is fantastic, I love that feature. But most of all I like the power and stability of the ride on the open road. In fact my favorite moments are merely cruising along the highway and just reveling at the quiet, yet powerful nature of its ride."
car_3227,Love this car!,"Not too big and not too small, perfect size SUV for me. Handling is great, nav tech can be improved (needs to be more intuitive but I have adapted), overall great ride.Bang and Oluf upgrade has awesome surround sound preferences.Its been 6 months, 2 long road trips with mountain driving, no flat tires or any other issues.I was worried about compact trunk space but my medium dog fits fine along with my groceries/travel baggage."
car_3228,A driver's SUV,"If you want an objective review, read Edmunds own. Compair to Accura RDX, Volvo   XC60, BMW X3 and MB GLK350.  Own a 2014 Q5 with 24000 miles, two trips from Florida to Boston and zero problems to date.  AC is great, MMI is difficult but once mastered it becomes somewhat intuitive.  Needs to be simplified.   Bad position of the Cruise Control stalk.  Confusing, gets mixed up with Turn Signal at times.  Need to move controls on the steering wheel. ( Are you listening Audi? )  Would I buy again?  In a heart beat."
car_3229,"Ride is great, MMI is TERRIBLE!!!","I'm coming up on a year with the Q5.  I love the ride, it sits well, and handles well in the snow.  Unfortunately, the MMI system that controls the navigation and entertainment is TERRIBLE!!!!!  It is not intuitive, it is both on the steering wheel (IF you can figure out which dial to roll) and has a small joystick on the console.  It is way too confusing, too distracting, there is no touch screen and overtime I try to use it I get frustrated.  The book doesn't help at all because a lot of things aren't in there or aren't explained clearly.  The system is so bad that it colors my entire feelings about the car."
car_3230,NOT COOL IN THE DESERT!!,The sunroof is so hot. The shade doesn't stop the heat from your head and the AC does not cool the cab to comfort. Bad AC!! Shame on you Audi. I expected better for what we paid.
car_3231,Brakes Screech known issue with no resolution,"The brakes have been screeching since 5,000 miles.  Called Audi Care and representative said it is a known issue with no remedy.  I will never buy or lease another Audi.  Horrible product and response from Audi.  I cannot wait for my lease to ends.  Do not purchase or lease this vehicle."
car_3232,"So far, so good for the most part","Have had a 2015 Q5 3.0T for five months and 2K miles now.  It's the S-line with MMI and the B&O stereo.  I love the looks, the comfortable seats, the panoramic roof and the smooth and torquey engine.  Quattro and the 8 speed transmission make for a nice, fairly refined drivetrain.  Zero issues to date but it's early.  

As for negatives the B&O isn't much of a premium stereo and sorely lacks both overall volume and bass.  The MMI is overly complicated and just OK.  The back seat could be a bit roomier but is not terrible by any means.  The cargo area doesn't seem as roomy as I would have hoped.  Curb weight at around 4400 lbs is excessive.  The engine runs out of power a bit at higher rpms"
car_3233,Audi Q5 - 6 month review,- Tires:  3 flat tires in 6 months when I have never had a flat prior.  No full size space.  OEM tires already discontinued after 6 months.  I now have one tire that does not match and Audi has said I need to replace all the tires if I want them to match 
car_3234,"Fun to drive, electronics are a hassle",This turbo SUV is a blast to drive. The leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter feel expensive.  Does great in the snow with factory tires. Backup camera peeps when in Reverse if there is something in front of the car (so not helpful). Too many clicks to do simple things like change the radio station or climate control. Overly complicated electronics (I came from a Lexus RX). Put this engine in a Lexus and I would go back in a heartbeat.Update 3/2017 - drove over Eisenhower pass in Colorado and the transmission popped out of gear several times (this is an automatic). Dealer was clueless. Sold car shortly after. Not interested in a new car that expensive giving me headaches. Also one random time the locked driver's door popped open while driving.
car_3235,2015 Q5 Premium Plus 2.0T,"I upgraded from a 2003 BMW x5 to the 2015 Q5.  I considered the BMW x5, x3 as well.

Dollar for dollar the Audi wins.

Its nicely appointed, peppy and fast, roomy where it needs to be but not more room than you need.  (need more go Q7).  

In 2014 the roof rack was notoriously noisy when installed and you needed to get after market wind suppressors.  2015 roof rack now comes standard with them  (manufacturer actually listened!)  Again your choice to install roof rack if desired, the just bolt basically with included tool.

Very stylish, LED lights are awesome, great on fuel, fun to drive and has enough space for all my hobbies!

Love this SUV!  Love the full Pano sunroof!!"
car_3236,Ticked Off,"Just purchased my 2011 Q5 approximately a month ago.  Did my due diligence before I purchased it, and had it inspected.  Was only told it needed a new oil filter and oil, but everything else looked good. Took it o Audi for the 35K mile check up and added a couple extras to the inspection to make sure. Again, no issues...until a week later when my air conditioner wouldn't work. Turns out I had to get a new blower motor.  Following week, the car is hesitating and the engine light comes on, so need to take it in again. THEN, we take it in for a car wash and the person knocks the rear view mirror off...have to replace the ENTIRE windshield. WTF??? I really wish I would have seen this page before I purchased this vehicle.  NOT HAPPY!!"
car_3237,Unreliable - Expect Major Repairs Every 15K or So,"I have had several reliability issues with my 2011 Audi Q5 over the years, including: (1) Excessive oil consumption eventually leading to the replacement of engine pistons and rings (which Audi covered, thankfully), (2) Multiple mechanical and electrical issues that have prevented the vehicle from either starting or driving, requiring the vehicle to be towed multiple times, along with multiple (and very expensive) repairs from the Audi dealerships. Seriously, it seems like every 6-12 months another random issue pops up that renders the vehicle undriveable. I hold my breath each time I start it just waiting for the next warning light and four-figure Audi bill. Also worth mentioning that the jack is much too small for the vehicle and the spare tire is deflated (note the jack slipped when I was changing the tire in 2014 and crushed my left hand, leading to a trip to the ER and physical therapy; it remains sore and swollen to this day)."
car_3238,"Audi is not the ""Truth in Engineering""","I have had my Audi Q5 in the Audi service department 4 times over the last 6 months.  This time it broke down on me 2 weeks after Audi stated it was fixed.  Well, now they are telling me I need a new engine at the cost of $14,700.  They will not take responsibility for their mistakes or mis-diagnosis.  They said that is was a cracked head and that Audi does not issue replacement parts.  It has to be a complete new engine.  Not only has my car been in the service department for 2 months, Audi had the mechanic remove the cover and look a bit further.  I did not authorize anything to be done.  They still have my car and now have told me that they will not help with their mistakes.  Now I have no car and no answers.  The oil consumption is another issue all together.  1 quart per 750 miles.  I spent more money on oil than gas.  But as always, they say its normal.  The airbags in my Q5 are on the recall list.  Audi however, will not issue a recall.  They have left us hanging and has put mine and my families life in danger.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do  your research before purchasing any Audi product!UPDATE:  we have the audi towed to a private mechanic that said it was the timing chain tensioners and if that were fixed my car would run. Per audi the engine is blown. These people are crooks."
car_3239,Disappointed Beyond Belief,"After purchasing 4 Audi's from the same dealership I am at a loss for words.We bought an extended warranty to 100,000 miles.We had ongoing issues with oil and at 82,000 miles the pistons were replaced.At 103,000 they now tell us, after all services were performed at the dealership,there is a problem with the engine compression.They say it is our problem.Wow, I spent over $42,000 on a car that now will require a new engine and is over the warranty by 3,000 miles.I thought Audi was a premium brand that stood behind its product and appreciated a loyal customer.I guess 4 car purchases does not count for much these days.I don't think I'll be buying nor recommending Audi ever again"
car_3240,Great Overall Small CUV/SUV,"Have owned my 2.0T Premium Plus for 5 months now.Waited until honeymoon phase was over to write review.Coming from an 08 Infiniti G35xS to this, so big change.Wife drives an Infiniti XQ56 so I don't need anything larger.Grew tired of ""G""cramped interior, lack of cargo/storage, road noise, no fold-down seats and gas mileage.Looked strictly for smaller CUV that was fun to drive, AWD, handled well, had good power, some decent cargo while maintaining the mpg's.Cross-shopped FX35, SRX, Touareg and X3.Love Q5!! For 2011 model year you had choice between 2.0T of 3.2.The 3.2 sucks more gas, lacks low-end torque and add over 200lbs. to car.ZERO issues with oil consumption."
car_3241,2011 Audi Q5,"Love the car. Haven't used a drop of oil in over 40,000 miles.Added a new exhaust system, made a big difference in performance"
car_3242,"3.5 years, 58k miles and counting.","Purchased new 2011 2.0T with sunroof, no Navi. I use this suv all the time - lots of hiway miles, some offroad/farm tracks, vet errands, cross country. Need the SUV format. 1st set of OEM Tires lasted about 45k, new Pirellis I think are even better. I keep a qt of SynthOil in the boot, in 3 years have added 4 quarts total - glad mine's not unique, and seriously people, this is not among life's major problems considering all the positives. Lifetime MPG is 24.7. Audio/iPod/Sat is great. Cargo is functional, plenty of passer space.It's a solid efficient SUV, I don't know what I would get instead. I do have a soft spot for that Subaru/dog commercial, but Q5 suits me for work and after work."
car_3243,Disappointed,"Bought a Q5 in 2010 August. While this is a great car to drive, problems with the oil consumption ( it is a major irritant) and brake pads ( I have done 47 K miles) and have them elaced twice. What is truly disappointing with Audi is the way the company and dealership have washed their hands of these issues. I used to own a BMW before shifting to an Audi, but this is definitely the last Audi I would ever buy"
car_3244,Fantastic value for a luxury vehicle,"I have owned this CPO 2011 Q5 for 4 years now and it is a pleasure to drive. Lovely ride, good service by the dealer although I have extended warranty up to 100k miles. There were 5 issues over the years - one is a broken sunvisor which was replaced free of charge, a leak/gap in a body panel that caused water to come in...this was also addressed through a technical bulletin and repaired free of charge, a fuel pump sensor, PRV, hood latch sensor, all were fixed under warrantI. Build quality could be better and I was told that Audi is working on it. I am a cautiously optimistic Audi fan but the only Audi's I buy will be CPOs since they come with extended warranty"
car_3245,2.0T oil consumption,"I got this car relaying on Audi brand . I'm very disappointed that info about excessive oil consumption in these engines was available before. We are going back for refill oil every 1,200 miles.That is very annoying. Dealer does everything to accommodate us including free car wash. They claim this if within tolerance.We see dozens of disappointed Audi owners there.DO your research before you buy.There is more and more info online about this problem."
car_3246,What the sales people don't tell you.,"My Audi Q5 burns about 1 quart every 4K miles and we've owned it for about 1 1/2 years and has 22,000 miles. Audi says that as long as it's not more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles it's ok and in the mean time they won't do anything. Moreover, in the owner's manual (page 273) it states the following under the oil consumption section: ""Depending on the way the vehicle is driven and the operating conditions, oil consumption can be up to ½ quart per 600 miles. Consumption may be higher within the first 3,000 miles.""I expect more from a $50,000 car and Audi is washing their hands off on this issue.If we had know, we would have bought another car."
car_3247,Still loving my Q5 after 15k miles!,"I have put 15k miles on my Q5 since taking delivery just over 8 months ago, and I am loving it!The design is great inside and out -- an extremely handsome car.The interior fit and finish is impressive, especially the special order ash wood inlays.The Bose audio, built-in nav and Bluetooth systems are all great.The Q5 handles very well for an SUV -- very car-like, and the 3.2 L V-6 is very smooth.The transmission responds well whether driving leisurely or aggressively.The S setting on the PRNDL really kicks it up a notch by holding gears to redline during acceleration."
car_3248,2.0T Q5,"Quiet, comfortable daily driver.Averaging about 24mpg.Love the steering (easy to turn in parking lots and slow turns). No effort to drive.Would not like this in a sports car, but works well in this application."
car_3249,Replacement for my Beloved Audi Allroad,"After driving (and loving) my Audi Allroad for 6 years - I was looking for a replacement.Didn't expect to convert to the ""Q"" but after looking at my alternatives outside of Audi I became a believer.Had looked at the BMW X6 (great drive but too expensive for what you get) as well as the Volvo XC70 (only Allroad alternative...but not) and new Porshe Cayenne (no GTS) - but kept coming back to Audi (this is my 6th).I finally sat in a Q5 and realized what a good fit it was.Roomy interior (no kids so back seat doesn't impact me) - and enough storage.I opted for the 3.2 engine as I highway drive and need the power. Inside quality/design/technology are pure Audi. Ride is smooth and quiet."
car_3250,"First Audi, not my last if it holds up.","Traded a 1998 ML320 for a 2011 2.0T base model. Looked at new and used diesel ML's, Touareg, Highlander Hybrid, Venza, Pilot, MDX: Q5 was way better, especially on a twisty road. Amazing zip for a 4, and awesome brakes! 3000 miles to date and no problems. Really fun to drive compared to prior suv's, including ML, Pathfinder and Volvo XC 70. Plenty of power driving over the Cascades from the valley, and passing on the interstates. 31 mpg at 65-75 mph on a recent 400 mile trip down I -5, fully loaded with 4 people and luggage. Base sound system with ipod is more than adequate. Panoramic sun roof doesn't cause interior overheating in the Northwest with temps to 90. Couldn't be happier so far."
car_3251,"Good looking car, poor build quality and horrible service","Under 15K mi & water pump went out, front brake pads need to be replaced, wipers already shot (I live in SoCal & the vehicle is garaged) & I have the backseat constant rattle that Audi will not fix.We were just about to drive through the desert before the water pump failure...that Audi didn't warn us about.Instead, it ruined our trip & they washed our car for the inconvenience.They also deny that there is a problem with the seat rattle.Just do a search on it & you will see all the problems so many are experiencing.Now, I have to use duct tape to muffle a rattle that Audi will not fix on its 45K vehicle that is still under warranty.This is my second Audi and my last. Money pit!"
car_3252,Best In Class,"We got tired of our 2008 Audi TT 3.2 sports car (fun but impractical) and traded it in for a 2011 Q5 2.0L with the Premium Plus package. We could not be happier with this vehicle. It is far superior to the competition with a great blend of style, luxury, comfort, and economy. The electronics are phenomenal. The displays are sharp and crisp. Ride is a perfect blend of tautness and comfort - just returned from a 400-mile round-trip. Interior is extremely quiet. Perfect size, lots of leg room and plenty of rear storage.Getting close to 30mpg at $4.00 plus per gallon saves a lot of gas money.Dealership experience at Audi of Fairfield (CT) was terrific."
car_3253,2011 3.2 Q5 Prestige Pckg,"After doing a LOT of research and test driving we kept coming back to the Q5. There is nothing else quite like when you combine looks, features and performance. We liked the 2.0 engine but the 3.2 has no lag and it is silky smooth. Now, after hearing about the oil usage of the 2.0 we are very glad we chose the 3.2. Yes the gas mileage is not quite as good but we are ok with that."
car_3254,Out performs MPG estimates,"I am an Acura MDX driver who was tired of limited leg room for the driver. The Q5 is smaller but has a longer wheel base and has removed the irritating foot pedal that played havoc with my shin bone with a simple lever on the center console.Start, stop, set parking brake within inches of each function. The prestige styling is to my likingand performance with the 3.2L engine has exceeded my expectations in both power and mileage.My entire music library is available by simply cable connecting my ipod in the glove box;simple lead thru on the car's 7"" screen."
car_3255,Watch out for the 2.0T Engines,"I tried to do as much research as possible and every review kept pointing to the Audi 2011 Q5 with the 2.0T as the best at this time.So I bought one.The ride is excellent, gas mileage is very good, the fit and finish is excellent but now comes the big issue.The car burns oil at a very high rate.At 4000 miles I had to add a full quart of oil.The manual says it can burn 1 qt. every 600 miles so I guess that mean at almost every fill up of gas put a qt of oil in.That sounds ridiculous.I called 3 dealers and all said yes it does burn a lot of oil.Well that is just not acceptable so I sold it got a Toyota Rav4 4WD with more power, more cargo room and does not burn oil."
car_3256,Audi dealership quality,"I bought this 2011 2.0T premium plus for my wife and she absolutely loves it. The car is comfortable, quiet and suits us well. But there seems to be a little bit of transmission lag when the car pulls away in the mornings. Very subtle and goes away. This is strange for a $40K car! I also bought a 2011 Acura RDX 2 weeks afterward, which IMO is more fun to drive and accelerates faster. Interestingly, the dealers could not differ anymore. The guys at Acura of Boston (Perry and Niso) were extremely nice, h elpful and there were 2-3 calls following the sales to check in. Benardi Audi tried to get me into paying a higher finance rate and never called once to follow up."
car_3257,Wonderful vehicle,"I told my wife the other day that I actually look forward to my commute just so that I can drive this amazing vehicle.The ride, quiet, handling, performance, wiz-bang gizmo's, styling... these are all first rate. I compared many cars and kept going back to this one. It took me nearly 6 months to make a decision, and I have NO regrets. Complaints from reviewers about the overly complicated Nav system were obviously written by Luddites. It works wonderfully (except for what I wrote below). The feel and drivability of this car is outstanding. The other vehicles in it's class just don't compare. Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but the Q5 is all good taste."
car_3258,LOVE THIS CAR,"Long-time BMW driver who was looking for a new experience...I found it with this amazing car. Fantastic handling, great power, good build quality, supreme comfort. The technology in this car was also a big seller for me (MMI/nav system is awesome).I had wanted to buy a Volvo Xc60, as I like the sporty looks of that SUV (and the understatement of driving a Volvo). However, compared to the Q5, the Volvos' interior and ride quality were totally lacking. This car handles like a sports coupe, and it is just so much fun to drive. Also looked at the new x3, sadly BMW missed the mark with the styling of that new release."
car_3259,Audi Q5 2.0T Premium Plus - No Need for V-6,"What a great vehicle!We bought a new Q5 2.0T for my wife to replace her 12 year old Lexus RX.We couldn't be happier so far and love everything about the car from styling to performance to value (under $40K).The Q5 was the runaway winner after comparing to the new RX (what is wrong with Lexus??!!), Volvo XC60, Infiniti EX and FX, Cadillac SRX, LR2, and MB GLK among others.(We looked at everything except the BMW X3, which wasn't available yet in December and we knew would be ridiculously priced anyway).The 2.0T will provide the best fuel economy and more than enough power - a shock to me.I would have never through a 4 cylinder could power an SUV like this one."
car_3260,Best car I've ever owned... so far.,"I've owned many cars; (in no particular order) VW's, Ford's, Subaru's, Infinity, Lexus, etc. I have never had a car that was more enjoyable to drive, be in, or look at. It handles so very well on wet, dry, bumpy, smooth, pavement, uphill or flat. It's quick and tight. But it's also very comfortable and plush. The seats are amazingly comfortable and supportive. Visibility is wonderful.It's got the Nav., which I was hesitant to get, but now LOVE! The Audio system is great, especially the iPod dock and controls.Got the 'Teak' with the Cardamon (beige) leather. Gorgeous! I've never had a brown car, and this is a real beauty.So far... so good. I've had it less than one week."
car_3261,Look Out BMW and Mercedes,"I ordered a Premium Plus 2011 exactly to my specs with B&O stereo (worth every penny), 19"" wheels, hitch, and navigation.Quartz Gray w/ Cinnamon interior.The Q-5 blew away my expectations.With 12,000+ miles it is consistently delivering 28 mpg on the highway. Amazing!Also ordered special Audi package 20"" wheels with Pirelli Scorpion Zero Asymetrico all-season aftermarket tires on it.WOW!The car tracks like an arrow and looks fantastic.The interior functions are laid out better than any vehicle I have ever driven.Don't need to take your eyes off the road for any reason."
car_3262,Great SUV,"This is our 4th Audi and it's our favorite one.We had a Q7 and it was awesome, but a bit too big for us.We went down to an A3 and it was too small.However, the Q5 fits in the middle and it suits our needs perfectly.I can't get over how fun it is to drive the Q5 and it drives very much like a car.It's a very practical car and we think it's awesome!"
car_3263,First rate ride,"I just traded in my wife's 2008 Platnium Toyota Sequoia for this small more manageable Audi.Having been a fan of Audi's for the last few years, I drive an A8L, thought she would enjoy being able to step into, instead of climbing up into, a luxury vehicle.She is extremely satisfied with how the car handles, the excellent visibility, and the smooth power train, not to mention the upgrade to the bang and olfsen sound system. Audi is the vehicle to challenge all others."
car_3264,Soooo much better than the X3,"I bought a used 2010 X3, drove it for three weeks and hated it. Rode like a brick on concrete wheels (ultrastiff).I've owned BMW's before and can say that the X3 is a complete mess.Returned it to dealer who gave me full value back - thanks Carmax. Having success years ago with an A4, I test drove the Q5 and bought it on the spot. A similarly equipped unit from Benz or BMW would be thousands more. BTW - A voluntary recall is in effect for the 2011 Q5 and it deals with a computer update that improves transmission shifting. (downshifting was a bit rough).Existing inventory on dealers lots should already be updated. The update on mine did the trick and the trans works perfectly"
car_3265,Sweet Machine,"This is a sweet handling, tight, good looking personal utility vehicle (PUV).The size is right and the 2.0t engine/8 speed transmission combination is like driving a Swiss watch.The power/torque curves in the 1500-3500 RPM range we live in are actually stronger than the 3.2 V-6.It handles and rides like an A4 but hauls anything you want to haul.The panoramic sunroof is stunning, and the feature content of the base model is all you need."
car_3266,If only it had a better transmission,"After 1500 miles a few observations about the car. While overall a nice ride, it is hampered by the 8 speed tranny. It stutters and can be very harsh at low speeds (under 10mph). It feels similar to a car that is sputtering at idle, although it is coming from the transmission, not the engine. The tranny also is constantly shifting, and the sport mode doesn't seem to make it any ""smarter"" at gear selection, it just holds it for higher revs. My Sienna minivan provides smarter, smoother, quicker shifts (how's that for an insult?)."
car_3267,Fabulous vehicle,"We recently purchased a 2011 Q5 3.2.  I am very pleased with our purchase.  My last three vehicles were a BMW X3, a BMW X5, and a VW Tiguan.  The Q5 has the convenient size of the X3 with superior handling, the luxury and comfort of the X5, and the biggest surprise it has better gas mileage than the Tiguan.  Audi Raleigh has treated us like life long customers and definitely make us feel like we matter.  A world class vehicle from a world class dealer.  Thanks Audi and Audi Raleigh."
car_3268,Exactly what I needed,"I drove a 2500 chevy silverado for the past 4 years, driving over 60 miles a day to school and back.  I questioned whether I would need the pick up function of my pick up truck, but I do not miss it one bit.  I test drove all the other new vehicles and this one out classes them all. I spend my winters in VT at the ski hills and the Q5 is very sure footed.  I have zero regrets, I LOVE the Audi Q5."
car_3269,"Awesome, fun to drive Audi!","Soccer Mom looking for more fun while getting close to ""mid-life crisis!""  Got the fun back!  Wow, love the power and handling and feel of this drive.  With hardly any inventory around, had to take the offered package 2.0T premium plus and love it.  Sporty, luxury, can't-take-my-eyes-off-of-it beauty!  Tight space inside but the sacrifice is worth it.  Not getting the mileage yet that I was hoping for and premium gas pricey but still worth it! Hope the Audi ""quality"" holds up over the years.  A little concerned about a big hiccup feeling when slowing down towards stop sign (outcome of drive-by-wire?). Interested to know what that is and why and is the car okay?  Overall, very pleased with Q5"
car_3270,Wow!,"It was time to replace our Grand Cherokee & had pretty much settled on the new Caddy SRX.  Then, we actually drove one and left the lot horribly disappointed.  But the Audi Q5 Prestige?  Wow!  This car has power, even on the worst San Francisco hills, handles like a Porsche, but rides beautifully, and is so crammed with features that you can't list them all.  It's been a ""head turner"" too.  The feel of well engineered quality is there everywhere you look.  We are elated over this car which seems to perform well above its competitors and doesn't have the ""run-of-the-mill"" feel that most of them have.  Highly recommended."
car_3271,New 2011 Q5 2.0T,"After driving the Q5 in V6 form several times I was glad to see the 2.0T come out for 2011.  It definitely sounds like a 4 cylinder (albeit a smooth one) and the new 8sp transmission does need to shift more often to keep up to speed. But overall I am extremely happy with the Q5 in 2.0T trim.  It drives like a car with great handling and a quiet, smooth ride.  I have the Premium Plus with standard 18"" wheels as well as the Nav package and B&O Stereo.  So far a great vehicle."
car_3272,New 2011 Q5 2.0T,The 2.0T engine in the Q5 seems more than adequate to me.  It seems almost as fast as the V6 with considerably better gas mileage.  It is also quiet and refined for a 4 cyl turbo.  The vehicle is screwed together extremely well and is a pleasure to drive.  Did not know if I would like a CUV after having many sport sedans but so far it is a great handling vehicle.
car_3273,Loving my new Q5,"I have never owned a crossover vehicle before, We've had the Q5 3.2 Premium Plus w/navigation for a few days now and I have found myself taking the long way home whenever I can. It drives much like a car...handles great and and has a nice turn radius.I love the quietness of the car when your inside with the windows closed it's well soundproofed."
car_3274,"Cross country tourer, urban worker","Superb driving dynamics,  I last owned an Audi in 1998, and everything has moved well ahead.  Also owned FX35, RDX. This is better than both on sheer driving satisfaction - fast, quiet, comfortable, roomy, competent and handles great.  28mpg on a 2,700 mile cross country trip to LA, over the Rockies. Panorama roof and screen were fine, and quite enjoyable under varied conditions.  Opted against Navi, not a 3d fan and in 5yrs, resale on Navi I am betting will not be worthwhile given many great options emerging on handhelds.  Love the 2.0t and also the 8 sp and the S drive choice is quite a good aggressive option for urban cut and thrust.  Roomy, efficient, and beautiful. Big ups for the Q5."
car_3275,My Best Car Purchase Yet,"After researching dozens of cars for months, I decided to visit my local Audi dealer to check out the Q5.  I was immediately in love with this car.  The design is beautiful,fit and finish is amazing.  The engine is smooth and powerful.  Audi has a real winner with the Q5."
car_3276,AUDI Q5 fun to drive,I have only driven this car for two weeks and am thrilled with it. Two most outstanding attributes is it's performance and comfort. The torque generated from this engine is incredible. You feel as though you are driving a car with a lot more horsepower. The size and pep make it so much fun to drive.
car_3277,Happy with,"I moved from a Mercedes ML350 to the Q5.  I went with the 2.0T over the 3.2, it seemed more fun to drive and I like the turbo sound when it kicks in.  The vehicle is quiet (not as quiet as the ML) and the ride is very nice, firm yet quiet and solid.  The steering is good but I wish it was more tight like the Mercedes and the BMW. The handling is superb, much more car like than truck like. The comfort is very good, the seats are much better than the Mercedes and it seems like there are more adjustment options.  I wish there was a little more thigh support.  The rear seats are a little thin and there is not much leg room but not an issue for me. Gas mileage looking promising, I got 24 combo."
car_3278,One sweet ride,This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. It drives very smooth with plenty of power for a 4 cylinder.The build quality is up there with Mercedes & BMW. I had a 2003 Acura MDX and paid more for the Acura. The Audi Q5 as far as I am concerned is a lot of bang for your buck.
car_3279,Loving it,"Comparing to most of the SUV, the ride is so much smoother and quiet. Handling is excellent. Pick up is good with lots of power. I love the sporty look and gorgeous design. I love the new color ""Teak Brown"", it is cool, elegant and unique. Although the price is slightly higher than other competitors, it is still worth it. Can't go wrong with the German technology."
car_3280,Don't need the V-6,"My girlfriend and I drove both the 3.2 and 2.0T, needless to say we went for the 2.0T. This engine delivers more torque than the V-6 and torque is what drives power to the wheels. The 2.0 felt more tossable and having 8-speeds vs. 6-speeds made this vehicle a blast to drive. So far we are averaging 22 mpg combined driving. We also cross shopped the Mercedes GLK and Acura RSX but none of these other vehicles felt close with respect to interior comfort features."
car_3281,Looks and Performance,"Audi has a winner For people who want a zippy crossover with great mileage and luxury. Excellent handling, smooth ride, Navigation and Bluetooth are easy and very driver friendly."
car_3282,Nice to Drive,"I sold my MB C230 to buy an SUV, I was undecided about the Q5, but searching through similar vehicles ( Toureg, X3, and GLK350) I'm sure I didn't make a mistake."
car_3283,Great reliable car.,Drives like a tank. Built very solid....
car_3284,Audi Q7 tdi premium plus,This is a great car. Best for long range trip.
car_3285,Audi Q7 Prestige,Tire and maintenance are very expensive
car_3286,brake issues at low mileage,"Front brake noise first appeared at ~13K. Had an oil change done at 15K only find out that we are staring at brake job, pads and rotors, for both front and rear, estimated at $1,600. Both dealerships commented on this as ""normal wear"" and so did Audi Customer Care. Dealing with Customer Care is a joke. Apparently my 20+ year driving experience and owning multiple SUVs/trucks and not having the brakes shot at 15K means nothing. I suggested that the dealer pays for rotors and I pay for pads, so will hear back from Audi in a couple of days. Complaints about the breaks/rotors replacement at early mileage is something that various Audi forums cover well. Thinner break pads (7mm) vs. other luxury SUVs and softer break pad material, all seem to contribute to the issue of premature brake failure. Single use rotors, which are not supposed to be serviced until ~35,000 miles according to Audi Q7 Maintenance Schedule, need to be replaced with every brake job, which can drive the cost up to $2,000 for parts and labor. I'm excited at the 2017 Q7, but who needs a brake job that soon, so may not be trading in next year."
car_3287,front interior,I'm frustrated with the layout of the center console:I have to take my eye off the road to use the radio/navigation MMI controls.Also the same with the cup holders as they are too far back.Voice control doesn't understand my commands or maybe I don't understand what to say.Radio knob is out of the way and when out of my usual territory it is difficult to find a radio station.The cruise control is visually difficult to see.I don't like the wiper system as when I turn them on the rear wipers seem to go on too due to its location on the stick.Vehicle has a lot of road noise.I thought I'd get better fuel mileage with the diesel but am only getting 25 mpg on the highway.
car_3288,Beautiful Full Featured Car - but some caution.,"The car drives really smooth in drive mode, but in sport mode it's a little jerky from the start but thereafter is smooth and fast. I've never owned an Audi before and the 8-speed Tiptronic is very smooth, but it doesn't go into a true manual transmission mode, most likely for engine safety reasons. Meaning, in manual mode, when you down shift, it won't go into a lower gear unless the RPMs are at a certain level. If the RPMs are too high it won't allow you go to a lower gear. So you don't really have the control that you would have with a true manual transmission. For example, you are going too fast and want to down shift around a curve, it won't let you unless you break and slow down first. That said, the transmission is very smooth if you know what to expect from it. I live in the mountains and the car is heavy, so it is a bit mushy on the curves but handles well. The heaviness is good in the snow and provides for a quiet ride. When the doors shut, you really feel like you are getting your money's worth. Now as far as features, it is fully featured and the details make all the difference. Audi has added nice touches; such as, there are two sun visors on each side and the one visor has the option of swinging to the side while the other blocks sun from the front. Additionally, the visor that swings to the side has a sleek pullout extension that allows for additional sun blockage. Now for the cons: I have only 22k miles and have already replaced all four tires and it’s due for breaks in another 1k miles and the service assistant said that rotors usually need to be replace with each break pad change as well , so maintenance is expensive. Also, I the check oil has come on twice between oil changes even though not due. So I called the dealer and they said I needed to add a can or two to get by until the oil is due for a change and that it is normal for the car to burn oil like that.  I have also had major dashboard warning lights come on twice and had to bring the car in twice, in addition to regular maintenance, for these reasons. The first time I brought it in was for the “Audi Q7 engine emission warning light” and the “Audi Q7 glow plugs pre heating warning light.” They said, the car had been exposed to bad diesel and they ended up having to change the lower fuel pump.  Then after two months I brought it in the second time for the same warning lights. Again, the claim was bad diesel and the fuel filter and all the fuel lines had to be changed. The car is still under warrant, but the thought of have to pay for all this is scary. I’m hoping this has been worked out, but I’m skeptical since I only go to major brand fuel stations."
car_3289,Not totally German made!!!,"Currently I have 35k miles on the car and found out there was a major timing chain issue, something I didn't expect on a luxury car. Fairly quiet cabin with obvious road noise from the factory tires and progressively get worse as tires wear out."
car_3290,Love my diesel,"Car handles great, we love the diesel power and the milage is ok especially with my heavy foot. Overall I feel like Audi lacks in the tech department compared to my old X5 and my current '15 GMC Sierra"
car_3291,2015 TDI Q7 _ review,"I traded in my MB 2012 GL550 for the 2015 Audi Q7 TDI.    Overall very impressed with the ride and how quite the Q7 is compared to the MB.  The Audi TDI has great performance and rides much-much smooth than the MB GL550 did.   Plenty of room in the Q7 '15 model for us as a family of five.  The technology is great, easy to use and functions as one would think, not a complex interface like MB icommand.  Audi technology features are well done, I have internet enabled in this Q7 and it gets a great signal, we've connect up to 5 devices, the max is 8 devices.  Of Course Bluetooth enabled works well too.   Overall I love how smooth the Q7 is, handles well and while it's a V6 Diesel with 240 HP it has over 400LB of Torque per ft.  The MB GL550 was a bullet at 390HP but rode rough I thought and the technology gap with other car manufactures in the 2012 MB GL series was just not good.    The Audi Q7 gets great milage about 18-19 in the City and over 25-28  m/p/g on the HWY, much higher too is possible, but I have a heavy foot.  One could get in the 30's for HWY milage easy.  Great interior.   I recently put in Adblue myself and the ""Adblue"" light went away after registering full."
car_3292,Q7 2015 the worst,"the worst experience i v ever had .... i leased  a brand new Q7 2015 back in october 2015  and i have taken the car back to them 8 times!!!! barke problems ,  from the first day i picked up the car ....windows making noise , wheel bearing problems, wheel alignment and tires off balance, smart key door opener not functioning , squeaking when u apply the brakes, driver side and passenger side molding coming off, tires making very loud noise .... i have all my documents with 8 visits i had and finally the last visit they have hit my car in the service department and i have to t\leave the car 1 week to get fix( bumper and rear bumper light was broken!!!! The service manager is a nice guy but he came up to me saying .. Dear Mr Zahra this is all normal and it could happen to any car u buy !!!!what!!! a brand new Q 7 2015 for the value of $60000.00 and i have to expect this to be normal?!! im sorry this is not normal at all my dear friend. im very disappointed and very shocked"
car_3293,'15 S line Prestige does not come with USB ports,"I'm fairly peeved that I bought a car in 2015 that doesn't have USB ports. Didn't even look because every car I've been in since my '12 Q7 has had them, including every cheap rental. My '14 Audi S7 has them, as did my '14 Silverado. I assumed that there would have been some kind of progression of in the equipment on these cars since 2012. But seemingly, I bought the exact same car again with a slightly different options list. :-)Seems like an easy thing to work around, but they did not even provide a charger socket in the armrest,  just on top of the console, near the shifter. So if you want to charge your phone you can cram it over in the glovebox or have your charger and wiring and phone sitting on top of the console like it was 1996 all over again. It was bad design in 2007 and it's comical in 2015. I'll have to go to a stereo shop to get wiring run into the armrest. Just like it was 1996. :-)Enough whining about that oversight. It's still the capable SUV it was in 2012. Because of the VW TDI scandal, I was unable to purchase the TDI. Which I thought was a phenomenal powertrain. So once I've driven it a while, I will review the new 3.0T more thoroughly.  I was expecting it to be sadly underpowered by comparison, but so far I've been pleased with it. Sadly the back up camera setup has not changed, and compared to my other '14 model cars it seems really tiny and poorly laid out. As I said before, it really seems to be the same car as before but more options have become standard. Or at least more available?  Big ones that I didn't get in my '12 are keyless entry and start, and XM traffic info on the nav display.  Also, with the S line or prestige package, I got ventilated seats up front and heated seats in the back. The ventilated seats seem to work better than those in my '07 A8. They also offer a black optics package which blacks out almost everything."
car_3294,2015 Audi Q7 - A pure driving pleasure,"Pros: Real pleasure to drive, very quiet vehicle, roomy and spacious, luxury finish and classy interior. Very pleased with the overall performance, styling and technology features. Cons: Some items are smaller than competition - MMI screen, glove compartment, sun glass holder. Navigation is a little more complicated than the rest. Front camera not part of the parking assist package."
car_3295,wife loves it..so that settles it,"Looked hi and low for a Q7 TDI Premium Plus.  Found one  and couldn't be happier.  Had to take it in for a minor adjustment on the aft sunroof that rattled. Local dealer was very supportive.  Yes it might be pricey, but your getting alot for the money.  The quality of build, fit and finish is top notch.(update)several months later and i hardly get to drive it.   had to replace aft brakes.  easy do it yourself. everything on this vehicle is easy.  just do research.  transmission fluid is dextron VI.  local parts store has lifetime warranty on all parts.(update update)  wife drove my other vehicle and asked if she could have her Audi back. Took Audi on a road trip and actually got a tad bit over 700 miles on a tank of fuel.  This vehicle is a keeper to me."
car_3296,"Ok car, but Ok at $50k doesn't make the cut","Where to begin with this car? The biggest problem is that the controls, for the most part, just make no sense. Let's take safety - all other modern vehicles with front sensors alert you when parking. With this car, you have to enable the feature (or go into reverse first) before the system becomes active. That's not just non-intuitive, but just downright dumb. As for the side assist, make a turn when a car is next to you and nothing will register.  The side assist is only blind spot assist, and there are strict parameters where this function only works.  This is junk - the truth in engineering is that you help the driver and take the risk out of driving by adding modern technology, not that you take technology and make it not work the way it should.  Other controls are not intuitive either - from AC to the pain of having to use the wheel to enter an address for navigation.  Interior looks nice, but functionality and design are fighting each other.  Lexus and Infinity vehicles have much better fit and finish to them and are intuitive and easy to use."
car_3297,great car,great suv  but had some issue 1 time gas tank lid  did not  open  even with emergency opener did not open  glad I have enough gas to drive to dealershiproad side assistant  don't send anyone to fix this minor issue
car_3298,"Great car, Water leaks from de roof","Expensive repairs, and parts"
car_3299,A big lemon I want to love.,"Let me start out by saying that we absolutely love the look and performance of this vehicle.... when it's working.   The electrical system in this car is complete junk.  We have had repeated issues with the keyless entry, keyless ignition, rear gate closure, trailer electrical (lights won't work), air suspension, window switches, and now the HVAC fan motor is squeaking.   Each trip to the dealer averages $1,200-$1,500 for repairs.    Both Maplewood Audi and Audi of Minneapolis have the most lackluster service departments (they are owned by the same company, so if you're in the Twin Cities you're S.O.L.).I want to state again, that my wife and I love our Q7 when it's working.  However, the service costs are obscene.   Also,  I have a 2014 Porsche Cayenne and I'm starting to have the same electrical/sensor gremlins creeping in.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that our Cayenne is under warranty, but it still sucks to drop it off for maintenance every 5,000-10,000 miles because a sensor or system is malfunctioning.   I think we are going to avoid products from Volkswagen Group until they shape up on the electrical front."
car_3300,Nice ride with a price,"Buying an Audi you buy a very comfortable ride but wih that ride it comes with a price. Having owned a Q7 the ride quality was very nice but however it ""nickeled and dimed me"" however I wish they were just nickels instead of thousands and thousands in repair costs. Materials are very nice and easily accessible. The third row seat is tight but for kids it's fine. The styling of the exterior is what I believe to be one of the best looking SUV on the market."
car_3301,lasting quality through the years,"I have had my Q7 for 10 years and have loved it since day one. This is the only car I have kept for this length of time in my life and the reason is, it never disappoints. For a family of 5 it has been a great traveling car and very comfortable and convenient for every day carpooling and regular use. No major problems popped up along the way, just the usual...squeaking breaks, break replacement a few times, tire replacement 3 times and leather cracking in the driver's seat base (5 inches long) and passenger seat. Check-ups and other service visits usually end up over $500 a piece, but overall the car has been wonderful to have, reliable and very comfortable. I have loved owning an Audi so much that I may consider a smaller Audi model but I still need to evaluate if I want to pay the hefty service fees (as I have 2 kids in college at the moment), that aside I think I am going to keep this one to the end. I'm almost afraid to get something else because I have enjoyed owning this car so much!"
car_3302,Disasterous Q7 experience,"Where do I start? 2000km off warranty, the engine blew up and cost $15k to replace and install. the brakes have been replaced a dont know how many times(last count 4). Brand new exhaust system installed at 100k kms @$3800; and now a new fuel tank to the tune of $3200 and $1200 in labour. Car has only ever been serviced at Audi dealers. This is my 5th audi in 13 years and will be my last. Audi Canada has been very difficult to deal with and unresponsive. The obviously have no idea how much it costs to create the type of brand loyalty they r losing. As I type, i am booking a test drive in the 2013 BMW 5 series sport wagon. Good by and good ridance Audi. I should have done this long ago."
car_3303,Great car with unfortunate design flaws,"All cars have + & -; from a high end luxury SUV you expect mostly +. That's the case. My problem was leaking draining tubes resulting in water in the front passenger well and in the back, invisibly in the area with the unprotected amplifier, MMI, GPS units. Result: all failed + battery drained. Cost:$3,500 (not covered by warranty). That's the most disturbing part to me: this car has been maintained by Audi as recommended but I still end up with a problem I could not avoid. This is not compatible with the premium price you pay for a Q7, you expect peace of mind. Moreover it is a known problem since Audi/VW lost a class action suit on this problem. Details at LeakingAudi website and Twitter."
car_3304,Dream Machine,"The Audi Q7 with the 4.2 FSI motor is a dream to drive.  The adaptive suspension quickly adjusts to road conditions, the adaptive cruise is effective and alerts you to stopped vehicles,and the Sirius satellite radio signal is superior to other vehicles.  With the optional towing packing it effortlessly pulls my 5500 lb. tow boat and let's me soak up the sun with the panoramic sunroof.  At least once a week I get asked ""who makes that"" because others aren't use to seeing such an effective design.  If you pick captain chairs for row two - everyone can enjoy heated seats - and as long as the third row is not regularly used - this (heavier than a Tahoe) Q7 will sweep you off your feet."
car_3305,Q7 - THE #1 SUV on the market!,"This car has truly amazed me! I thought there is no more surprise after driving AMGs, BMW 6-series or the Escalade, even just jumping from a Cayenne Turbo to the Audi. Well there is."
car_3306,No more Audi for me,"My 3 year lease on the Q7 is coming to an end an I will definitely not lease another one.  From the start there have been problems.  The car came without the A/C charged, the rear passenger handle fell off twice before it was finally fixed and my ""leather seat cracked in the first year.  My brakes have been squealing every time I brake for the last year and they said it was brake dust. They said to spray brake area when washed and then step on brakes hard a few times.  It doesn't work.  The sound drives me crazy.  I've had the same experience as others with the tires--had to replace before 25k miles.  Overall car looks nice and is comfortable, but lots of quality problems."
car_3307,Jekyl and Hydemobile,"18"" Bridgestone tires that came on car the loudest tires I've ever owned. They also ride like they are filled with concrete. Sunroof shattered at about 5,000 mi. Repair caused a leak that migrated to the back and damaged electronics (all Audi repairs). Radio failed at 30,000 mi along with the CD screen. Film on the windshield (interior) cannot be removed by any glass cleaner either we or Audi have tried. ""Milky"" view of the world. Fuel consumption about 17 city and 22 hwy. on premium. Car is terrible in snow and ice - poor traction under power or brakes."
car_3308,Q-Tastic!,"This car is Q-tastic!  I have owned/driven some of the nicest cars on the road today, and I believe this is one of the nicest luxury cars on the road.  We purchased the car used, and have had no issues to date.  I do worry about the cost of ownership long-term, but I believe that with a good extended warranty and a little planning, that risk is very manageable.  We purchased the V-8, and I was very worried about Fuel MPG.  It is actually better than the Volvo XC90 T6 we replaced it with.  It gets really thirsty if you jackrabbit at every stop, but a mix of City/Highway will easily yield 18mpg or better.  Audi's are great because they are highline but not snobby.  You will love this car!"
car_3309,Comfy and Quiet,"This is the most comfortable car we have purchased (have had Mercedes, BMW, VW and other Audis).  This car has a luxurious ride for all and a high quality interior finish that is better than BMW and Mercedes. The car feels huge when driving, especially in tight spots, this isn't good or bad, it's just the way it feels. The Quattro system is outstanding in wet or snowy conditions and we always feel secure in this car in bad weather. Our rattling panoramic roof was quickly adjusted at the dealer during regular maintenance and hasn't rattled since. No other issues. It is a very heavy car so expect items that wear out to do just that (tires/brakes) especially if you're hard on them."
car_3310,"So Much Money, So Little Value","I bought this German beast new and with the lease up in a couple months I'm looking forward to it going back. This vehicle looks amazing and that's where the love story ends. Brakes squeal...yes, they've been replaced...it's just embarrassing. Tires cup easily-3rd set, apparently, it's the engineering of the AWD. MMI issues...was in the shop 12 times before it was fixed for good. Engine sensors shot & fixed. Instrument cluster currently needs to be replaced. Thermostat went. Lurches from 1st to 2nd-explained as a safety feature. Faulty back-up sensor. Poorly attached molding. My car was in the shop for a week and after haggling for a rental, I got a ford focus---my lease $1448???"
car_3311,"Owned for 2yr and 7mo, still love it","This is a beautiful machine that still turns heads.  You can see people looking intently when they are overtaking.  This is our 3rd Audi and it is a pleasure to have. My wife drives it 50 miles a day 50/50 highway city.  It has nearly 29000 mi on it.  We have only had one hiccup, and it was with the oil pressure.  A light would come on when first started. This is a lease vehicle and we are not looking forward to the day when it goes back.  We have the option to buy but it does not really fit our life needs.  I'm not sure what to say about all the brake wearing problems people are having.  The Q7 weighs over 5000lbs and it has brakes that stop on a dime.  Maybe driving style helps."
car_3312,Terrific SUV,"We have had a vastly different experience to many of the recent posts. We have had this car for nearly 2 years and have had no defects or problems.  The engine, MMI system, tires etc have all been faultless.  The car is extremely comfortable and surprisingly easy to drive given its size.  In fact, we are considering purchasing another Audi due to our satisfaction.  Perhaps we just got lucky, but this vehicle has been terrific for us. Prestigious, stylish, comfortable, and reliable. If it got 10mpg more in the city it would be perfect!"
car_3313,Replaced Brakes & Tires @ 18K,"I just spent almost $2000 to replace the brakes & rotors and the tires on my Audi Q7, which is only two years old and has only 18,000 miles on it.  I called the Audi dealership, and they said I must ""drive the car hard.""  They also said they see plenty of Q7s that need brake replacements at 18K.  I'm a middle aged housewife--not a teenage speed racer who slams on the brakes; I'm more like Driving Miss Daisy.  After reading many reviews, I have found out that many other owners have had to do the same ""routine maintenance"" during the course of their leases.  Unfortunately, the $500 maintenance package that I bought when the lease started only covers oil changes.  Luxury Jiffy Lube."
car_3314,Hesitation,"I've experienced an unnerving hesitation occurs at low speeds (ex.) parking lots or left turns when a full stop is not required. The accelerator must be pumped several times before the engine responds.  Dangerous at times so I've learned to adapt to the quirk. Audi has looked at the car twice so far and says there is no apparent problem and my experiences can't be duplicated. Don't find it to  be particularly nimble (unfair comparison, perhaps to my previous MDX) Very quiet and luxurious with very good visibility."
car_3315,DON'T buy an Audi,"Important to note: I am a grandma and a teacher. I do not speed.  I always take my car for service promptly!  I am absolutely outraged with the quality of this car.  I only have 19,000 miles and I need a NEW ENGINE.  How ridiculous is that!  This vehicle has had many faults.  One example is that emergency brake locked on me while I was driving on the freeway, very scary.   Other defects: Window mechanism broken on both front windows -Molding coming off -headlights fogged from inside -bad brakes. BE AWARE...the blue-book price has drastically decreased FIFTY Percent.  Overall,  DON’T buy an AUDI!  I wish I never did!!!"
car_3316,German Junk,"Despite meaningful price-incentive at purchase, discount can't make up for poor quality and ongoing issues.  Brakes and tires needed replacing at ~25K mi in response to which dealer congratulated me for outlasting the average (most customers only get 22K out of both at best)... Reason: heavy weight.  Quickly upgraded tires (they were pathetic in snow/ice - seems insane for an AWD SUV) but had to stick with same (lousy) brakes due to some proprietary sensors (anyone test this theory?).  Sunroof rattles, steering wheel vibrates at 70 mph, 2nd row seat rattles like a 15-year old Chevy pick-up.  Dealer happy to keep trying to fix but sick of driving A4 loaners."
car_3317,Very Disappointed,"Very nice looking car but brakes have been squealing since the day I bought it. Resurfaced twice. At 15K service told me I needed new brakes at the cost of $2k. Said they changed the warranty on brakes to 12K miles and I see why now. Neither Audi nor dealership were helpful just basically said ""sorry"". From what I understand there have been many brake problems in this vehicle. Brakes still squeal. Terrible customer service from Audi headquarters and dealership and obviously do not stand behind their vehicles. It is a fun car to drive but for the  money I spent you would expect high quality and customer service. Fuel economy bad even for an SUV. DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE."
car_3318,A Little Disappointed,"This is my 3rd Audi.  I have owned an A4 and currently still own an A6.  I am disappointed in the reliability and quality of the Q7.  I have only 28,000 miles on this car and brakes are already going.  The tires also need to be replaced.  I have never owned a vehicle where the brakes and tires went bad at such low mileage.  The engine sounds like it is struggling all of the time and is sounding more and more like a pick-up truck and not an Audi SUV.  We spent the extra money for the keyless start and it doesn't work when it is cold out.  I think the quality of Audi's have definitely decreased."
car_3319,Not up to Audi standards,"Our 3rd Audi. This one is just not up to what we had expected. Example - the gas door feels and works like a Yugo. Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio. $800 to fix and not covered by warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance. Not much different than most but different than our past experience. Have had for 1.5 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply."
car_3320,Did I make a mistake?,"The Q is my 3rd Audi.  The car has good performance and room inside.  As my wife says, ""this thing can turn on a dime and give you change.""  It does have a great turning radius for this size of car.  Mileage stinks (gets about 14/gal).  Great handling on snow/ice in the mountains of Colorado.   Had to replace all brakes & rotors at 18k miles at the tune of $1200.  Dealer said this was a common problem on this car.  No warranty coverage.  Just take it out of the pocket.  This should really be a recall issue but I'm sure Audi won't step up to the problem."
car_3321,This will be my last Audi,"I traded in a lemon 2002 A6 in for the Q7. Within 2 months of the Q7 purchase, the windshield wipers collided during a bad rainstorm on the highway. After 5000 miles the power lift gate stopped working and the back seat wouldn't lock into place. After 19000 miles, the tires needed to be replaced for $1200.  Then at 28000 miles the brake warning light came on, $1700 to replace the brakes and rotors. There was a leak in the sunroof and mold started to grow on the drivers side carpet. Great looking cars, very poor reliability and very expensive to keep up. From now on, I'm spending a little more for another BMW. There is a reason you see many more older BMWs than older Audis on the road."
car_3322,"Good Engineering, Poor Customer Service","I enjoy driving the Q7 and it is a well built basic SUV. Unfortunately for $60K price tag Audi falls short on customer service and attention to detail. I had serious electrical problems the 1st week I drove out of dealership and the dealer's reaction was ""so what"".  They fixed it but it was as if it was expected.  Next the battery died several times and had to be jumpstarted.  After bringing it in 3 times Audi finally figured out the Software had a glitch. The MMI system(electronic brain) is unsealed and located below the tilted forward cup holders- so if you spill even a little liquid on the shifter the MMI shorts out and it costs $1000 to fix. Audi said not their design flaw my fault."
car_3323,Wish I would've done my homework,"Like many of you I fell in love with the Q7. I've had it a year here's my issues: electrical system went out (brains of the car), fuel gage failed, 3 tire flat tires within 1 year. Also had the same problem as someone earlier as a very small amount of liquid spilled next to the drink cups. It shorted my system to the tune of $1,000. Love the car and hate the car at the same time."
car_3324,I think I leased a lemon!,"Well, I really felt the need to read everyone else's reviews after bringing my car in to be serviced too many times! I got it brand new fresh from Germany, and love the way it looks & the way it rides, and of course all the bells & whistles but too many problems have occured! It started with the tire pressure light appearing on all the time, which took many 1 hour trips to be serviced only at Audi. Then, the fuel pump went out, took a few days to repair- parts only come from Germany you know- then a faulty back sunroof that let water in which caused me to drive a Grand Prix for a week...are you kidding me? I paid $65,000 to drive a Grand Prix? Needed new tires already, squeeking brakes,"
car_3325,A Piece of Junk!,"Bought the top of the line model fully loaded and a year later it has proven to be a piece of junk!  Brakes squealing since 5k and Audi is telling us ""it is normal and acceptable - just due to the design"".  Even gave us a fancy printed brochure justifying the squealing!  Motor in rear wiper already needed replacement, recall on trunk software, and MMI mysteriously stops working from time to time. Told we will need to replace tires ""soon"" despite only having 15.8k mi on car and have only owned it one year. Audi has produced a fine looking car but the quality stops there! Do not buy one!"
car_3326,Let down,"Finally plunked down the cash for a German driving machine. Great handling, solid engine, but what a disappointment on the rest. From a jerky transmission (no trouble found of course)and creaky transmission to a $1200 MMI console from 2 drops of water and a door handle that fell off (these last two I hear happen all the time). Finish is falling off the console, cargo net fell off twice, gas door sticks open. I expect far better for this price car. Who is giving this all those 9.5's? Are their cars still in the dealer lot, or did I get a lemon?"
car_3327,What a beauty!,"I bought my Q7 brand new and it is my favorite auto I have ever owned.  It is responsive in S when you want to feel speed, it has the perfect size inside and out (not too big and not too small). I love the 4 captain chairs and third row just in case we need them. As a new mom, I love the automatic tailgate and smart key: each door unlocking when near without pulling out the key. The best of all is its sexy lines. It doesn't get better than this!"
car_3328,Silence is Golden ?,"My Audi Q7 has been the nicest drive for handling, comfort and acceleration! but the electronics have failed since about 3 weeks after I brought it home. When it doesn't work, it doesn't work... no GPS, phone,radio, CD, iPod, nothing. And this was at the same time the steering column got stuck in the down position. While setting my preferred settings I lowered it, it stayed there for a month or so, the service dept fixed it but the rest is a on going mystery!"
car_3329,Love the car... few issues,"I absolutely love my Q7. I will warn you though of a major design flaw. If any of you ever drink a liquid while driving, beware. I spilled the smallest amount of coffee and it shorted out part of my electrical system.This little spill will cost you close to $1000.  If you notice, the buttons are directly in front of the cupholders. What was Audi thinking? Now when I have my coffee or water, I put a cloth over the control panel!"
car_3330,Acura Upgrade,"After buying a Acura MDX a year ago I traded it for a Q7. Huge upgrade! And basically the same price, no comparison. This was the buying decision I should have made but at the time I was a new SUV driver and the Q7 seemed like a lot of vehicle for me then. I love the Q7, from the interior and exterior foot lights to the powerful but smooth styling. Build quality is exceptional, superb braking and transmission makes for a very safe and smooth ride."
car_3331,Audi Q7 SUV Vehicle,I love to drive my Audi Q7. It handles like a dream on the highway. The Quattro AWD is the best I have driven for the size of vehicle the handling is nimble.
car_3332,Love it,I love the SUV.  Audi has done it again. The car is a pleasure to drive.  The only problem I had is the air compressor was defective and I could not fill my tire with air when I needed to.
car_3333,Great SUV,"I have two children ages 4 and 11 months. There is enough room for one car seat, a booster seat and still room for an adult on the same row! I owned a minivan before, and although there is a little less room in the Q7 it's not by much. Love the way it drives. MMI is really easy to work. The only bad thing is it gets bad gas mileage. But, you have to remember it is an SUV."
car_3334,Excellent for some people,"I've been driving mine for about 6 months now and I do love it.  It's a lot like driving a loaded A6 (my Q7 is a 4.2 premium).  It handles well, accelerates well and is extremely comfortable to drive.  The tech bells and whistles offer everything you could need and want.  My only complaint with the car is the off-road abilities.  Thule doesn't make racks for it and for anyone who is an outdoor enthusiant looking for a more rugged vehicle worthy of hauling bikes, kayaks, etc, you may find yourself a little disappointed.  However, some research early on may prove that this is the perfect all around vehicle for you.  My wife has a Lexus and i've gone through Land Rovers, BMW X5, Tahoe, etc."
car_3335,"First, but not last Audi","The Audi Q7 3.6 Premium is a beautiful car.  I get many people peeking through the windows trying to see the wonderful interior.  I also get many compliments on how it looks everytime I go gas it or go to school.  I got the Q7 after I traded in my Navigator.  I hated how the Navigator drove and looked compared to Q7.  The Q7 makes other SUVs look like boxes on wheels.  The Q7 drives very easy in tight spaces making it feel smaller than it really is.  People may think that the MMI will be hard to operate, but it's not.  All the rows have comfortable seats, but the third row is hard to get to.  The ride is much smoother than the Navigator and goes over rough surfaces very nicely."
car_3336,Nice car!,Purchased 3.6 premium. I love this car! Handles and performs like a sports sedan even though this is a big SUV. Fun to drive!
car_3337,Best SUV on the Planet!!,"This is by far the best SUV on the planet, save perhaps the VW Toureg which is made at the same factory as the Q7.  The Q7 is much larger than the Toureg.  The quality and ride are just outstanding and in line with the Audi reliability for building world class vehicles. The interior fit and finish are first class, and if you fold down the third row you have incredible storage space.  Of course if you fold down the second row also, the storage space is huge.  As far as safety goes, the Q7 comes with all the state-of-the-art safety features.  This is in line with the safety committments from both Volkswagen and Audi, both of whom are always in the forefront of automotive safety."
car_3338,Truly an Audi,"Got a rare S-Line version with factory 21"" wheels that are polished on the face and painted grey on the inside. Car looks very menacing all in lava grey. Handles very well, although not quite as quick as our dearly departed Audi allroad 2.7T. But torque is phenomenal. S-Line 3-point steering wheel mounted shift paddles allow for even smoother gear changes than those possible on my DSG equipped Audi TT 3.2Q."
car_3339,My dream SUV,"I think this is the most well built and value packed SUV on the market today. I've looked at many others such as the ML500, X5 4.6, Range Rover Sport and GL450 - none of them compared in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, they all have their strengths, but overall I felt the Audi Q7 was the best fit. For the money what you get in the Q7 is an exceptional value. I have enjoyed the drive and find it hard not to drive. I also have a Lincoln Navigator and an Audi A8L - the A8L used to be on the top of my list to drive but this Q7 edges it out ever so slightly. The Navigator was nice but it lacks that European road feel."
car_3340,Well satisfied,"Had a steering column bind, would not adjust. Audi replaced column, works fine now. Mileage is better than I expected, 19.4. Find the cup holders some what clumsy to use. The Bluetooth is great. Had a 2005 Touareg that had front sensors and memory exit seat, miss both of those. Overall well satisfied."
car_3341,Most solid Audi yet,"Great build quality, this is a really solid vehicle from the heavy feel of the doors to the look and feel of the interior. This is my 4th Audi in a row but first SUV so I really looked at all the options. I think the Audi offers more class, refinement, and style than the rest of the crowd without any serious flaws. If you are not a snob but insist on German engineering and styling, the Q7 comes highly recommended."
car_3342,One of the best Audis yet,"My family has owned Audis ever since I can remember. There has always been at least one in the family when I was growing up. The second car was an assortment over the years and the Audis always outperformed them. I had to get the Q7 after trading in my A6. Acceleration and fuel economy is pretty good considering the vehicle's size and weight. The interior is impeccable. Everything fits together and the materials are high quality. The three panel sunroof is a definite plus, and even though it is tight, the third row can be handy. Dont use it on a regular basis, but when I'm in a pinch, it works out fine. With the third row folded, the trunk is extremely spacious; the power liftgate helps a lot."
car_3343,Best buy luxury SUV,"I was previously driving a Mercedes R-350 before the Q7 was out, and when it came out I knew I had to drive it on looks alone.  I'm a 27 year old father and when I had to drive the R-350, I didn't enjoy it, because it looked like a minivan and it wasn't fun to drive.  The Q7 was so much more masculine looking, it drove better, sat more people and most of all it wasn't a minivan."
car_3344,Outstanding vehicle... hands down,"I am thrilled with this car.  Fun to drive, comfortable for 6 adults, able to tow 6500 lbs., and unique among a sea of lookalikes.  The 3.6 performs very well with an assertive growl and silky smooth acceleration.  Punch it and it will GO!"
car_3345,Q7 review,"I've had Audis for years  and have always felt secure driving them. I live in a four season climate and have driven in snow and ice storms. This Audi feels very strong to drive and very safe. The ""Quattro"" system is the best four wheel drive system of any make of automobile in my opinion."
car_3346,Another Great Audi,"I've been driving an A6 for seven years and wanted to upgrade to an A8, but the price point was more than I wanted to spend, so the Q7 was a great alternative - A8 size and comfort with the A6 price tag.  It is very luxurious inside and out and the 4.2 V8 accelerates nicely, though not as quickly as my A6 2.7T. The 3rd row seat is not for anyone over 5'3"", but I only plan to use it sparingly and it folds down easily to provide ample storage.  My golf clubs can fit sideways (unlike in the A6 or A8).  One complaint is the ride is a little stiff and I can feel the bigger bumps in the road.  I have 20"" wheels, but didn't opt for the adaptive air suspension (darn)."
car_3347,Fun SUV,"I've own many different SUVs over the past 12 years from two Fords (Exp), Subaru (B9), Jeeps and even my wife's KIA which was a mistake. The Q7 3.6 premium is fun to drive, responsive but still a SUV (weight). I drove the BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo before I decided on the Q7. The Q7 handles like a heavy sport car as you fill the road a little too much with the 20 inch wheels. The fit and finish is exceptional. A great buy and really fun to drive. Watch your speed, as you may not notice how fast you are going. Options can make the car a little pricey. But you pay for what you get."
car_3348,What a special vehicle,My first Audi and I must say I am very impressed.  Now considering adding an S6 or maybe the new S5 to my stable.  Driving this 4.2 S-Line makes me feel like a very lucky guy.
car_3349,Seriously Bad,"Third row! What third row, you mean you can actually get in it. A child could wiggle in. When the 3rd row is up that it, no space left. For the length of this car, where has all the space gone. As for auto trunk lid. I broke it within 10 minutes. Seriously. Yes I know I should have read all the instructions but I don't expect guests and friends to have read the manual to properly operate the auto trunk lid. This is a huge car with all the space used by the front half while we were buying it for the rear half. Our mistake, please don't make the same one."
car_3350,Amazing,"I have owned about 26 cars in my life and several Audis, but this is by far the most complete package, fun to drive, comfortable, well made, vehicle I ever owned. It is a true pleasure to drive, and it is beautiful, inside and out. Everything is well thought as always on Audis. This the best SUV in this class hands down."
car_3351,Superb vehicle - remarkable in every way,"I replaced my 6th GMC Yukon/Denali with this S-Line Q7 and could not be happier.  The Q7's build quality is absolutely outstanding and the features are awesome.  Vehicle is rock solid on freeway and handles like a much smaller and lighter vehicle.  Exhaust note is really fun.   My other car (for summer) is a BMW 645 CiC.  I'm averaging 15 mpg over 4,000 miles.  I can just begin to feel the engine opening up."
car_3352,Excellent ride,"Just leased an Audi Q7 4.2.  Added dvd nav, sunroof, technology pkg etc.  The Q7 is not only a fun drive but secondly also extremely useful in hauling people and stuff comfortably.  No problem in terms of accelerating up hills or moving getting around slower vehicles.  Interior is one of the finest I have been in with everything laid out nicely and easily reached.   The MMI takes a little bit of getting use to but now I have no problems.  Fuel mileage isnt great (13 mpg so far) but I doubt anyonewho  bought this vehicle is worried about the cost of filling the tank."
car_3353,Good Vehicle,"Nothing really to gripe about.  Excellent ride, real tight, no rattles.  Plenty power and torque.  All the bells and whistles.  I like it.  The styling is growing on me."
car_3354,"Fun to drive, great car for a family!","I am amazed at how well car seats fit in the 2nd and 3rd row! This car has been great for my family. The day after we purchased this car it snowed a lot. This SUV handles better in the snow than our other 2 cars, being a Toyota Tundra limited 4x4 and a Jeep Grand Cherokee limited alltime 4wheel drive.  The seats are comfortable with different adjustable heat levels. Perfect for a family where one person is hot and the other cold, we each have our own temp. controls! An amazing car! Lots of room and it looks nice too! My only complaint is having a cell phone charger plugged in is slightly awkward. It drives like a car and suv combined. I am so impressed!"
car_3355,allroads lead to Q7s,"I had a loaded 2.7 twin turbo allroad for four years.  I started tracking the Pike's Peak concept with great anticipation.  I ordered my 4.2 Premium S-line with all the options.  Loved the allroad, but the Q7 tops it on all accounts.  Exhaust note is powerful when revving it up, yet quiet when featherfooting it.  MMI is not as difficult as people think it is.  The voice driven system works great and is very accurate.  The adaptive suspension goes from low and sporty up to tall and beefy.  The sound system is impressive and easily fine tuned.  Gotta love a sun roof.  Especially one that is over 5 feet long and 39 inches wide.  When the motorized screen retracts oohs and aahs are common"
car_3356,Impractical 3rd row,"When you are spending in the range of $55,000 to $65,000 you deserve comfort. I am quite disappointed with the 3rd row. First the 2nd row glide rail is not flush mounted, 2nd getting in to 3rd row is nearly impossible since seat does not retract fully, 3rd there is no room for even feet between two rows. Also no DVD player option."
car_3357,Q7 - Is it what people say?,"I have been reading what other people are writing about the Q7 so I thought I would take the time to write one as well. Performance: happens to be really good, it’s a fast car and it sits on the road well. Comfort: I have to say that it has been giving me a really bumpy ride. This weekend I had people in my car and we took a long trip together, and they all complained that it shook them up. Interior design/exterior design: In overall it’s done really well, except for the fact that in the backseat you can’t seat any adults, and when you do put down the seats you get very little room for cargo compared to other SUVs ."
car_3358,Uncompromising and commanding.,"I have had my Q for about two weeks. I traded an FX45 for it, which I loved. I wanted something larger, but sexy, alluring, but professional. Audi really did it. I am not saying I am not going to do a few mods (larger tires and rims is all), but it really is a beauty all on its own. I looked at the MDX, VW, another FX, Range Rover Sport, BMW, and Mercedes. I have never felt so much safer and hotter at the same time. A lot of room for my single self and traveling companions. Would make a nice soccer mom look FABULOUS. All the other mommies will be jealous. There is so much room."
car_3359,New SUV is Welcome Addition,"After 6 years driving a Lincoln Navigator, the Q7 was a wonderful change. It handles like a sports car; seats are very comfortable; engine and ride are extremely quiet and smooth; luxury features such as MMI, bluetooth, rear camera, air suspension system, large sunroof and sunscreen, and rear hatch are very useful; and the electronic stability system really works - I felt very safe descending a steep, winding, icy road without having to use the brakes. While the purchase price is high, I feel it is worth it. I actually look for reasons to drive this car. My gas mileage is a bit better than estimated: 21.5/highway, 16 city. I have received many compliments on this car."
car_3360,What a grand surprise,"I always expect great cars from Audi. But this was the best surprise. It is a fantastic ride. The comfort, handling and power (from a 6 cyl) is outstanding. This is the best vehicle in its class."
car_3361,A FANTASTIC SUV,"I have had my Q7 for about a month now and I love driving this SUV. I got the showroom model so it comes with 20"" wheels and alloy rims. The A/C controls are a bit difficult to figure out at first, but once you get the hang of it you will find its usefulness. We have rear climate control, the Bose sound system, power tailgate, Bluetooth, 3rd row seating, and of course the MMI (navi) among few of the features."
car_3362,Worth the wait,We ordered our S-line Q7 in August... well worth the wait! The driving experience is everything we expected and more. The motor sounds authoritative and has plenty of power. Seating is comfortable with plenty of head room for the tall ones. Third row seat is designated for small passengers on short trips. Once we became familiar with the MMI and other options they were very user friendly and worth the time to learn. We live in a warm climate and had solar tint installed on the sunroof which helps with reflective heat. Learned the battery is under the drivers seat and will need to take to dealer to get battery replaced. Why? (Bummer). Overall great ride and meets our expectations on all fronts.
car_3363,Best SUV I have driven,"I bought many SUVs.  The Q7 is the best SUV I have driven so far.  Great to drive, so comfortable.  It is a hybrid of a luxury sedan and an SUV.  Even my kids love the comfort of the back seats.  Great choice for a family."
car_3364,2000 Miles and Loving it,"Waited two months for it to arrive but it was worth every minute.  I agree with most of the other reviews here.  The handling is what I am most impressed with.  Just does not FEEL like I am driving a large SUV.  Steering is precise around residential streets and around the clover leafs at speed.  Took my parents out last night.  My Mom kept saying ""this is so nice!!""  My Dad kept saying ""I can't get over how smooth the acceleration feels"".  They are both long term Suburban/Yukon owners.   Highway mileage about 21.  City about 14.  Not great but I knew what I was getting.  After a month and a half and 2000 miles of driving, I have yet to see another one on the road.  I just love that!!!"
car_3365,Great Luxury Family SUV,"The Q7 has met my hyped up expectations. It's a solid ride with  premium features you expect from Audi. It has a very thoughtful design, down to the ""coming and going"" external and internal lighting features. It's also easy to see the road in the Q7 unlike some other large SUVs."
car_3366,LOVE This SUV!,"So far I am REALLY happy. This car/SUV is fun and sporty but drives like a luxury sedan. The engine growls but not too loud. I drove the 4.2 (not much more money than a loaded 3.6) and felt the 3.6 was faster, not sure why ,maybe less weight? Better gas mileage too. I also drove the S-line it felt a bit doggie, maybe the suspension or tires? I love the look and feel of the interior and all the bells and whistles especially the keyless entry no more digging in my purse! The MMI takes some getting use to but well worth the time. The only thing I did not like (at first) was the berber carpet so I ordered the all weather mats this made the car look great, now I like the durable berber!"
car_3367,Great SUV,"I got my Q7 3 weeks ago. I used to have BMW X5 and I just could not wait for the next generation due to time restrictions that I had. Q7 is much roomier than X5. Since I have all optional packages, I love to play around. It doesn't ride like SUV but It does not like X5 as well. I am not sure how it will be in snow conditions but I am expecting much better than X5 since Audi has 60/40 split where X5 was more 20/80 split on all wheel drive. So far everything is looking good."
car_3368,Yes it's good looking but not reliable,"All I can say that the car looks good inside and out. But unfortunately I had the car less than two weeks and 500 miles, car check engine light came on and the car started to choke and transmission started to stall and oil light came on and its been in the shop for 5 days already and the good part is that they don’t have a clue what is going on with the car."
car_3369,Great car,"Perfect handling, - feels like a sports car. 0-60 in just 7s.  Car itself doesn't feel like a big car. First when I saw it I thought, - oh my God it is too big, but after test drive I fell in love with it."
car_3370,I was pleasently surprised,"This is one of the best SUVs I have ever driven. During my first test drive I didn't know what to expect but I was shocked. Very comfortable, great handling, nice power (V8) and full of features. You will not be disappointed."
car_3371,**It is just an awesome vehicle**,Had to wait 4 months to get this because of the 6 seat configuration and the mfg of the 3.6s but it was well worth the wait.  After owning 2 large SUVs (AWD Escalade & 4WD Navigator) neither one can hold a candle to this vehicle. This vehicle handles more like a sports car but on a much larger scale.  It will get up and go and the brakes will bring you down in a hurry not to mention a super smooth ride.  Adaptive air suspension really makes a difference as well. The interior is very sporty but also luxurious.  The premium leather is definite quality.  There is nothing about this vehicle that is not first class and I am more than happy with my purchase.  The only downfall was the wait time.
car_3372,Great Car For Family,"I never thought to own an SUV unitl we had a child and we test drove this car.  Wow, it feels a lot like my BMW sedan yet has room like an SUV."
car_3373,It's excellent,Just got a fully loaded Q7.  Drives very smoothly. Engine sounds great in sports mode.  Super comfortable and beautiful interior. If you're into technology - the MMI is great.
car_3374,A great choice,"Got the Q7 about 3 months ago, and love it since. Before I was driving the FX35, which was a bit quicker but you can't really compare the quality and features that come with the Audi. As a surfer, I manage to fit a 9'6 longboard inside the car together with my wife and two kids! A great buy with cool looks."
car_3375,One week into my 3.6 Premium ownership,"Well, so far the Q7 has met my expectations. The handling is smooth, precise and powerful. Found out that my Q7 has no air conditioner for the two seats in the very back when my two nephews sat there last weekend. Bummer. On our trip to Santa Barbara on Saturday the temperature was well over 90 and the sunshade covering the panorama sun roof was doing little to keep the sun and heat out. My head was baking. Why not a solid sun roof cover to keep the sun and heat out? Went to a window tinting place in Van Nuys, CA to have the entire sunroof and the little sun roof at the very back tinted with a new film that has ceramic in it. Cuts the heat but not dark. Seems effective so far."
car_3376,New SUV is worth the wait!,"Handles like a sports car, or at least better than my previous Infiniti FX, and the FX is SMALLER.  Brakes are powerful. Luxury features are everywhere. Engine sounds sweet and it's powerful. MMI system is very logical and easy to use.  I can't wait to take it skiing!"
car_3377,Smooth and Refined,"I bought my Audi Q7 to replace my Honda Pilot. I needed the extra towing capacity and I wanted a luxury SUV. The Audi Q7 did not disappoint me. The inside is typical Audi, comfortable, quite and well thoughout. The controls are all first rate and the car's performance and handling are top notch. The mileage is averaging about 16.3 mpg in mixed driving. If you select the sport mode on the transmission, it makes a huge performance difference, but it does hurt your mileage.  All in all probably the best SUV on the market today."
car_3378,No funner 7- seat  SUV  out there!,"I just got the car a few days ago and it was worth the wait! Having three kids and looking for a luxury and sporty SUV with room for friends is challenging. Audi did it! Not only is the handling fantastic but with the air suspension upgrade, the ride is so smooth. The features for the driver and the passngers are fabulous.  Although the third row is too small for an adult, its perfect for kids.  Having the sun roof in the rear doesn't make you feel confined as in other 3rd row mid size SUVs."
car_3379,Audi's greatest sedan is an SUV,"I am not an SUV guy,  I was looking at an A6 or even an A8.  This was responsive and more fun to drive.  I made my commute less stressful.  I  do have some guilt about the mileage after driving an A4,  but the visibility sitting up higher made up for that, and the handling kept has all you expect in German Sportiness"
car_3380,Audi got it right,Simply perfect.  However I can't imagine this beast with anything less than a 8 cyl.  The mid range torque is a blast in the passing lane.
car_3381,Great road trip vehicle.,I road tripped the vehicle from Naples to New Smyrna Beach (250 miles each way) the day after I bought it.  It was far and away the best driving SUV I've driven to date and I'd dare say it was just about comparable to my 7 series.  I only wish it had keyless start/entry.
car_3382,The SUV to DRIVE!!,"The Audi Q7 4.2 is a drivers car.  It feels just like an Audi sedan.  The power is impressive as well as the fit and finish.  Don't expect too much in the way of mileage, but with an SUV what do you expect. The car is heavy but feels really light and nimble.  It's exceeded all my expectations."
car_3383,The best SUV- $60K can buy,"Quattro-the most trustable all wheel drive system 350 hp with 325 torque gives an amazing performance. Most important, driving this big SUV feels like driving a sedan, not a truck at all. I love the interior, fit and finish, high quality materials with real wood and stainless steel and the exterior design is bold and elegant. I don't think there is anything better out there."
car_3384,The Best I've Ever Owned,"Adding a wife and a teenage stepchild, I came to the realization that my Lexus IS was simply too small for my growing family.  It was a tough reality as I loved my IS.  But now that I have owned my 2017 Q7 for a little less than a month, I have come to see my situation as fortunate.  Through a ton of test drives, I came to the decision that I could not settle for anything but this Q7.  I test drove larger luxury SUV's and there simply was no competition.  I'm an ""interior guy"", meaning it matters about the comfort and the gadgets.  And sure enough, this thing comes with EVERYTHING imaginable.  Add the connection to my iPhone and you can do about anything short of cooking a meal in the car.  Truly, this is luxury."
car_3385,NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE OR LEASE  AUDI,"Ongoing brake squel. Audi says it's normal. Sounds like I had the brakes are done at People Boys. How awful. Paint finish around grille area faded off after a year of car washing. Drivers side mirror whistles while driving 40 mph and above. Audi Pre Sense goes off whenever it feels and jerks seat belts even when no other vehicle around and likes to make our hearts jump to almost a heart attack. Worst vehicle ever for price. WE COMPLAIN CONSTANTLY AND ALL AUDI SAYS ITS NORMAL, NORMAL, NORMAL. $80,000 DOLLAR WASTE. SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE FORD EXPLORER AT LEAST FORD WOULD BACK THERE PRODUCTS UNLIKE AUDI. AUDI WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT. JUST IN ------- SUNROOF NOW MAKING VIBRATION NOISES WTF."
car_3386,Avoid this car,"The brakes squeak anytime the brake is touched.  The dealer says 80% of owners are complaining.  We have asked them to relay our dissatisfaction to Audi.  Nothing gets done.  The squeaking noise is like ""fingernails down a chalkboard"".  It is embarrassing to drive the car because of the noise.  Please do not buy this car.  So disappointed in Audi's customer service."
car_3387,nothing but trouble,"I must have gotten one of the first one's made.Nothing but trouble, brakes, tires, jerkyride when starting off from stop,and check engine lights that would't go off. Had it into the dealer 6 times in 14 months of ownership. I had enough traded it in for Highlander that is great for much less money."
car_3388,Beware of brake squeal issue do not buy,I have a 2017 q7 with 9000 miles on it and there is a horable brake squeal that they know of the issue and have no fix in site so In Audi USA words enjoy the car with the noisy brakes until they can find out what the issue is. So I have a 70000 car that’s an embarrassment to drive. I will never recommend Aud. The company does not stand behind there products...
car_3389,Look the other way! Beware! 2 q7's both terrible!,"Where should i start! What a nightmare! Leased a brand new 2017 in july of last year. To make a very long and frustrating story short what a nightmare problems out of the get go from suspension-interior and so on. No support from Audi at all just a brand new car 8,000 miles needing tons of repairs. Dealer decided to purchase the vehicle from us and being that the dealer steped-up to help us we decided to give it another try. Leased another 2017 AUDI q7 carbon gray metallic premium plus with warm weather package which meant higher payment and another down payment. Not even 24 hours into the new Q7 we had troubles with the supercharger. Should have known then it was not going to stop there. Center consoles get warped horrible design which leads into the terrible quality of the seats. we leased a Q7 with Warm weather package due to heated/ a/c seats hoping that these seats would wear better. NOPE front driver  seat 2nd row seat and 3rd row seats all need replacement. Drivre side front window needs window regulator slow roll down and noise.Drivers door has a pop sound which we have been trying to chase for 5 months. Have fun trying to close the doors 5x . Oh and don't forget squeaky brakes around 6-9k miles still no fix in site for that.  Ours for some odd reason has a rough idle and the other day just decided to start shaking and feeling like it wanted to accelerate while foot was on brake. YUP vehicle is at the dealer currently AUDI customer support/service no help and terrible  attitudes. Timing to get issues handled with AUDI is the worst. Being my first AUDI experience i would never ever do it again nor refer anyone to purchase or lease. I can only hope this review will save someone else a huge headache / loss of money! I just wait for this thing to break down again and/or for the next interior part to break."
car_3390,Worth the wait.,"I have 3 BMW X5 and love these SUV's however wanted a change. The new Q5 is very attractive but limited towing capacity and with production just starting in Mexico I was hesitant to purchase. Q7 Pros:-fit & finish, driver comfort, Bose sound system & electronics. Cons:- Exterior is a little boring and boxy, rear seat comfort, 16 week delivery lead time but worth the wait!"
car_3391,Exceptional car!  LOVE it!,"We based our purchase primarily on the Consumer Reports discussion of safety technology (side-view cam, auto stop, etc) . Rated #1 by far. However, the car also looks great and handles exceptionally well. The interior is true luxury with every possible amenity. It will be weeks before we read through the whole manual and get everything set the way we want! It's a little un-nerving when your smartCAR and smartPHONE are both smarter than WE are. It could use a few more ""luxury"" touches on the exterior - is pretty plain as is."
car_3392,A fun SUV,"Consumers report states, ""may be the best SUV they have ever tested""."
car_3393,Do not buy this car!,"It is bad when you are at the dealer service center and the salesman as well as the senior tech both tell you that they wouldn't own this version of the car! So my wife and I were looking to swap out our 2012 Lincoln MKX for another luxury vehicle with 3rd row seating to cover the new needs of our expanded family. We had owned the Lincoln for 3 years and aside from repairing a faulty cooling fan, the vehicle performed flawlessly. We drove it on many vacations and loved the ride comfort, features, and style. The only fault at all was the lack of seating which is what led us to search for something new. We thought we had found that in a used red 2008 Audi Q7. We choose this vehicle because we were looking to buy another SUV within the price range that we could sell the used MKX ($15-16k). The Audi won us over with the amount of features, luxury items, sportiness and pedigree being a cousin of Porsche and Volkswagen. The vehicle we purchased had comparable miles as our MKX had (75,000 ish) so we expected a vehicle that would be broken in with a few scratches here and there and maybe some slight wear on the interior. What we received however was something straight out of a comedy. We ordered the vehicle and had it shipped to our house. When the transport arrived the vehicle didn't want to start so they had to boost it to get it off the trailer. While at idle we began to smell gas. Upon inspection we found the fuel tank was pouring gas onto our drive! Went to move the car but it wouldn't start back.We had it towed to the Audi dearlership for repair ($210.00). 3 days later we picked it up after a service recall which repaired the leak free however the leak caused damage to the fuel pump which required replacement ($475.00) and to replace the battery it had to be programmed to the vehicle ($318.00).On the way back home however, the TPMS indicator came on then the ‘Hill Climb Assist Error’ indicator, then the ABS light and then the Brake booster light. Not far after the check engine light came on and the vehicle began to misfire. Additionally, as I was travelling back home the cabin began to get stuffy. I went to turn up the AC and both blowers were not functioning. I opened up the sunroofs and dropped the windows. Turned the stereo on to popping and cracking speakers. Not to be outdone, the charging port that I was using to charge my phone stopped working. As misery sat in on my 65+ mile trek home, it began to rain. I went to roll up the windows and close the sunroofs to find that the rear window wouldn’t go back up and the front sunroof only partially closed and the rear would not shut either. So the final 15 minutes of the drive home was spent getting rained on. After we arrived home my wife helped me force the rear window up and we managed to coax the main moonroof closed however in the process the rear plastic cover of the passenger seat fell off! Additionally, we opened up the rear hatch to gain better access to the rear sunroof but when we went to shut it, the hatch wouldn’t close. It took 10 minutes of coaxing it to finally get it all the way down. The next day we contacted the dealership and told them what had happened. They suggested that it could have been affected by the battery programming (I called BS on this but went along with it) and suggested we bring it back in for a diagnostics test to see. We drove the vehicle back, in the heat, without ac and only able to drive it 55 mph on the highway due to the engine misfire. The dealership to notified us that the AC blower motors were in fact faulty, the speakers were blown and the fiber optics were busted on the stereo (thus disabling the satellite radio and causing a short). The tire pressure monitors were all dead (they run on batteries which expire every 5 years or so and require replacement, even on the spare, to the tune of $275.00 each), the rear window resistor was bad, the sunroofs and hatch control assemblies were faulty , all but one of the charging port connectors were melted at their base and shorted (also something that is prone to failure as we were informed.) The engine misfire was caused by a faulty connection to one of the coils which was easily corrected during the diagnostic test. Overall, however the test alone cost us $330.00. Then the dealership told us the cost for the remaining repairs would total $4,385.00! We ended up getting our $14k back from the purchase and now own a Cadillac Escalade. Will never own an Audi due to the cost of repairs and the volume of items which are prone to fail with age!"
car_3394,Great vehicle,One of the best vehicles that I ever owned
car_3395,Best vehicle I've owned!,"I've owned 3 Japanese cars, 2 Americans, and this SUV by far is the best vehicle I've driven. It is so enjoyable and comfortable. Besides the fact that it drinks more gas than my dad drink his beers in a week, the Q7 is a fantastic vehicle. Just one thing, WHY THE HELL AUDI DOESN'T HAVE A REGULAR AUX PORT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD? I have to open the iPod box every time and it's just not very convenient. Other than that, I have no complaint about this beautiful SUV."
car_3396,"125,000 miles and still ticking.","The cupholders are placed in a terrible location, making spills into the navigation controls inevitable, as they are located just below the cupholders.  Even a minor spill into the system causes it to short out.  I have already replaced two and it looks like I have another problem.  The electronics should be better insulated to allow for occasional spills.  Better yet, move the cupholders to a less vulnerable location.For the second time, I am experiencing rips in the leather seating.  I have never had this problem with other cars, including my 15-year old Beetle with leather seats.  And no, I don't carry knives or screwdrivers in my back pockets.  Just had to replace the battery, which is located under the passenger side front seat, which needs to be removed to get to the battery compartment.  Ridiculously expensive for labor.  Audi wanted around $600 for replacement.  Had it done at my local foreign car repair shop for $380.  Replacing brakes is incredibly expensive, even when done at my repair shop."
car_3397,Disappointed,"I purchased my Q7 October 2008 & loved it for the first 2 years.October 2010 things started to go wrong. I drive a lot of highway miles so it was out of warranty.The lane side assist went out, the latch for the rear moonroof broke ($900.00 for a latch!) & in November 2010 the heat went out, only on the drivers side, then both motors on the mirros went out at a cost of over $300.00 each.It is now January 2012 & I am still dealing with heat issues after spending $1500.00 in repairs it still doesn't work properly, sometimesnot at all.Now my remote is beginning to fail.I have spent the last 15 months dealing with failures & expenses.I'm done! Will never buy Audi again!"
car_3398,Noisy engine,"The reliability has been poor, the worst of any vehicle a have owned. Had to tow it to the dealer in my first week of ownership, the engine just stopped running. Front bearing gone at 25,000 KM. Driver door keeps dropping, it has been fixed 3 times. Other problems, way too many. Frustrating. I find the V6 quite noise even below 2000 RPM; makes more  noise than my brother in law Ford Escape. Dealer service could be better"
car_3399,Tonka toy with a great ride,To  be honest we have not had big problems just lots of little ones. The gas cap cover is pathetic and the lock is a joke - open it with your fingers when locked. With kids and pets it seems impossible to not knock water etc over in the center console which ruins the electronics. Part of the body is simply falling off. This is our 4th audi and we have not looked anywhere else simply because of the way we were treated. This too has declined - still pretty good just less than their usual stellar. In 2 years the seat leather has developed a large long crack in it - our 10 year old a6 is still fine.
car_3400,So Far So Good,"Good car so far. Lots of comments on the great looks. No major issues to date. Ready for new tires at 27K. Brakes are coming. Pull a 5000lb boat with some difficulty. Pulls well up to about 50mph then struggles trying to maintain 60mph+, even on the slightest hill. I manually shift to keep the gearing correct or the engine just rev's really high. Recommend the 3.0 TDI or the 4.2 V8 if you plan to pull more than 3000lbs.  My biggest beef is the lack of a rear hatch close feature on the key fob.  Audi seems to think your hands are full when loading, but not full when unloading.  Can't reach the button with full hands. Wife wants another when the lease is up. Probably the TDI Prestige."
car_3401,Q7 4.2 S-Line,"Our Q7 has been at the dealer for the past 45 days and they have no estimate as to when they will return it.  This car has been a nightmare.  Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance).  The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design).  Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer.  The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!"
car_3402,Loving it,"I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I'd never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera).  With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7."
car_3403,Disappointed,Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops.  Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back.
car_3404,"Great machine, but not options","I have Q7 Premium S-line 4.2, absolutely great, fun to drive.  But, it would not be so great without all features. In my opinion adaptive air suspension is a must, adaptive cruise control is fun, great help, but be careful, it provides safety, but stay alert, in critical situations you need to take over. Parking sensors is also a must with such relatively large vehicle. The line assist possible saved me already from couple of dangerous situations and side assist also, although it takes some effort to learn to look at it.  A lot of features and after 5 months I am still discovering how to use them in concert effectively.  Tested BMW X5 (too small) and Merc. GL550, did not like the controls"
car_3405,Disappointed,"My husband purchased this car for me and traded in our A4 cab for it. I loved it at first. Then a month into ownership, the trunk latch broke. It wouldn't close all the way so I had to drive the hour away to the nearest dealership (twice) to get it fixed. 2 weeks ago, my MMI system stopped working and it was stuck to only play CDs. I took it in today and was told you're out of luck because you spilled something on it. Had I known this was such a common problem, I wouldn't have bought this car. Now I have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the MMI system. After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems to be an extremely common problem."
car_3406,Great fun machine in mountains,"Drove  4700 miles from Ohio to Wyoming and Montana, thru Chief Joseph highway and Beartooth pass. Typtronic tranmission was spectacular in moving through the passes, hair-pin turns and altitudes over 11000 ft. Six passengers very comfortable. Gas mileage acceptable and with hi speed western states 75mph limits a real dream to drive. Rear camera very helpful in parallel parking and in exiting parking lots. The water bottle storage in the doors was easy access and convienent. Air conditioning throughout the whole car was effictive. Access to rear seats challenging but once seated, very comfortable. Great car for a great trip."
car_3407,Car Seat in the Center Rear,"I love the car but am so disappointed that with a Britax diplomat infant rear-facing seat (one of the smallet, most narrow on the market) installed in the center position (the safest), I can only use one of the two adjacent seats. The other is unusable because you cannot access the seat belt buckle!  Even in my old A6 wagon this was not a problem. Further, with a carseat in the center location, it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row. You can move the carseat to the left or right but then your two rear passengers (imagine grandma and grandpa) are squished together and the one in the center has a very small seat. This is a silly problem to have in an SUV."
car_3408,Finally! No More Minivan!,"OK. Here we go. How do we make the case to not lease our fourth minivan in over ten years? Currently three children 10, 7 and 5. Get the whole family in the van and go visit the Q7. You won't regret it I promise. I know we need all that space and cupholders, but still just go check it out...you deserve it! Maybe, just maybe, the kids can sacrifice a little for mom and dad. Afterall, this vehicle has everything you need to survive as a family of five and it performs, looks and rides like no minivan I've ever owned in the the last ten years. I drive a BMW 5 series so this is for my wife. But, this vehicle alone has made me consider an Audi for myself."
car_3409,Dream come true,"Shopped for while... Mercedes, BMW... test drove all.  All great but Q7 won. Special ordered, S-line, adaptive cruse and adaptive suspension together was worth waiting for. Love line assist and parking assist system. Bought 16GB USB drive and have all my favorite music at my steering wheel controls."
car_3410,SUVs aren't dead,"Purchased this vehicle for my wife because of increased need for space but without the minivan appearance. It has been a pleasure to drive with good handling (minimal body roll) and reasonable acceleration for the class of car. (I drive an RS4 and still enjoy the Q7). The ride can be rough, however, especially at lower speeds -- some likely related to 20"" wheels that were a part of the s-line package. Wish the air suspension was an option on the 3.6 which would likely improve ride quality. Gas mileage is reasonable with the 3.6 (21mpg at 70 mph) given size/wt of vehicle. I'm willing to take 5-7 mpg hit over a minivan for the sportier ride and appearance."
car_3411,Dream SUV,Had an 02 and 05 X5 but needed something larger. Now have 3000 miles and no problems. Love the S-Line option but Audi takes 2 points off the residual value for leases which doesn't seem fair when you pay more.
car_3412,What a bargain,"I have had my Q7 4.2 premium s line for about 3 weeks. I just came back from a trip to North Carolina and I am in love. I think that the best feature hands down is the lane assist; it makes everything easier and you always are aware of your surroundings. I have owned an ML, X5, Range Rover, Escalade, 4 runner, Montero, and I don't regret or miss anything from those vehicles."
car_3413,An SUV that is actually fun to drive!!,"After driving a bulky Expedition for 5 years, I really wanted a car.  But with kids and lots of carpooling, a car was out of the question.  I really needed 3rd row seating. My quest was to find an SUV that handled like a car. After lots of test drives, nothing compared to driving the Audi Q7. It was actually fun to drive!  The all wheel drive makes turning ratios a breeze.  I bought the 4.2 L  and wow can it go! I love the MMI (takes a few hours to get used to but it is a great system). Seats are very comfortable, 2nd row seat huge, 3rd row I can sit in comfortably (I'm 5'6"").  Interior is so cool at night with lots of red lights.  The huge sunroof is a must."
car_3414,A fantastic vehicle,"I've had my Q7 for a few weeks now and I couldn't be more impressed with it. The ride, design, and comfort is unsurpassed. Being a technophile, this vehicle leaves you asking for no more. The iPod/iPhone interface is seamless, the navigation is easy to use and the overall MMI provides you with any information you could ask for. I selected the adaptive air suspension option, and that has turned out to be a great option, giving the car an adjustable ride, depending on the conditions."
car_3415,Easily the best SUV I've ever owned,"I've owned a Volvo XC90 AWD since 2004 and I was looking for a change.   I narrowed my choices down to the BMW X5, Land Rover and the Audi Q7.  After many back-to-back-to-back test drives I bought the Q7 and I have never looked back!   This car continues to impress and amaze me with it's effortless driving and sumptuous interior... this is my first Audi and it won't be my last.  The MMI system works great (much better than the iDrive in my wife's BMW 3 series) and the advanced parking system makes short work of tight parking spaces."
car_3416,"Rolling Thunder, A6 on Steroids","This is my first return to a German car in 6 years. This car feels rock solid. The handling and seating position makes for comfortable commutes on DC's Capital Beltway. The parking sensors and rear backup camera are great. The MMI and nav. system takes some setup and getting used to, but once you've mastered it, it is quick and convenient. The 6 speed auto delivers on its promises."
car_3417,Better than the 07s,"I rented a 07 3.6 for two weeks in March. The ride is much smoother, handling not as stiff, brakes not as touchy compared to the 07 I rented. The standard front sensors and rear parking camera are incredible. The slight front bucket seats are very comfortable. The standard 20 inch wheels are a great touch at medium and high speeds but a little rigid at speeds below 45mph. Better off with these 20s than the 19s or 18s when it comes to handling.The acceleration, S turn capability, ride are perfect. Stereo system doesn't get any better. For driving around town, I suggest getting the 3.6. Second row leg room would better for a SUV of this size. A Plus grade over all."
car_3418,Doesn't Get Any Better,"The 08 has front and rear parking sensors which are perfect addition. The front seats have a slight bucket which is also new. The MMI is very easy to use but have to agree with others that the nav. system takes getting used too. The handling and acceleration are incredible, taking hard S turns in the Q7 is a lot of fun. The brakes aren't as sensitive as the 07's. The 20 inch wheels are also standard. The ride with these at lower speeds is a little noisy but over 45 it's smooth sailing. Better to have these 20s than have the 18s or 19s with less handing. This Q7 needs to be driven hard on the highways or along coastal or mountain passes. This is not a putt around town SUV."
car_3419,watch out for the squeaky brakes,know before you buy/lease
car_3420,Q7 electronics will stop your car:big safety issue,"I customized my car and got it July of 2016.  My car has been into the dealerships for pre sensor issues 5 times.  Service department always stated that they can replicate my issues and the car was driving as is and designed. They reset my car to manufacture twice and adjusted my cameras grasping for some sort of an explanation.    My car stopped me at a turn light and shuts off.  Then it presence went on in bumper to bumper traffic and my seat belt choked back on me when there was no reason to. My fuel injector malfunctioned at 6000 miles.  Because they can't duplicated the concerns, they dubbed the car safe.  As a driver and my car stops for false pretense detection that could put my life at risk and possible a fatal accident.  It's definite a huge safety concern that I'm having a headache with.  Even with a captured video, what cannot be duplicated becomes the consumers fault. https://youtu.be/txjonKMic1U  Audi service department could not grasp my problem, so I only got service... but I never got the ease of mind for safety, nor the customer satisfaction that my car was fix and safe to drive.  They would hope that they fix it, until my car started shutting off or stopping me.  My car was in the service department more than I could drive it for my sensors and electronic malfunction that puts me at risks.  They descriminated my gender for the lack of knowledge on handling the car.  But they were never able to explain what happened to to my car in my video I have attached."
car_3421,Spend on what's important,"I have a few audi's with all trim levels. I opted for the 3.0 premium with cold weather and electronics package with nav and apple play. The basic options on the car really are great and span the vast majority of what is important. It drives almost as nicely as my A6, has ample room and is arguably the best moderately large SUV out there. Not as big as a suburban but infinitely nicer to drive with great gas mileage. The model I have kept the price below 60k. You can get another 10k plus into it but in my opinion there is no need. Really pleased with this 2017 Q7"
car_3422,New Audi Driver,"Expensive, but loaded with the latest safety features.  Rides and handles great.  Unbelievably quiet."
car_3423,Great Vehicle But expensive,Great Vehicle But expensive. They could have added extra features for the cost. Value for money thumbs down. Vehicle quality and driving experience great
car_3424,Great car but horrible service at dealership,"This is the first time we purchased an Audi - we were sold by the excellent interior and a new, understated style that comes with the 2017 model. Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We've since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+; some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off); the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won't hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the ""new"" rep - all the while I was calling their office and even asking Audi US office to help - I had to drive up to the dealership again. This time I asked for the sale manager and told him that I wanted an answer from him directly. This guy, their sale manager, PROMISED to my face, that he would definitely get back to me within a week, ""before next Friday""... Well, Fridays have come and gone and it's been more than a month yet not a single word from anyone at that dealership. Granted, those issues (e.g. missing key code) are mostly annoyance, not exactly life threatening. But you expect  certain service when you buy a $60,000+ car and want to have some trust in the dealership that they will take care of certain problems when needed. It's a shame because honestly we like the car, but the poor customer service has put a huge dent in our enthusiasm and adds a significant doubt as to how long we should hold on to this car.Update 8-2017: The experience with the service department at this dealership has been better than the sales side - yes I have been using their service despite the really bad experience with their sales because of the location and convenience. They are still not as responsive as I would expect when it comes to schedule appointments etc but they do get the job done on time once I get the car in and the folks at the service department are courteous and some of them even go out of their way to help."
car_3425,Houston we have a problem,"This car looks like a spaceship inside, which is pretty cool.  We got the grey color with the optics package.  It's a pretty awesome car....... So it appears.  However, on day 2 of ownership and approximately 100 miles we are already having reliability issues.  Today we got a ""safety system error"" yellow light on the dash indicating that the airbag is malfunctioning.  In addition, on 3 occasions the car has literally turned itself off by itself when we place it in park.  This happened one at the aim and twice when switching drivers in front of the house.  I'm not talking about the engine turning off to save fuel, I'm talking about completely off to the point we have to hit start again for the car to reboot.  Active lane assist is also nonoperative for some reason. At 70k we could have purchased 2 more reliable Kia's."
car_3426,SUV shopping fatigue,"We looked, drove : Mercedes , Volvo, Infinity, Acura:  Test drive of the Q7 SOLD us on the quality, ride, quiet, workmanship of this impressive vehicle. I was worried about being ""too big"" , but drives & handles super. Would strongly recommend the 6CYL engine upgrade. The ride control/performance choices provide varied and even ""fun"" options. The graphics option of virtual dash well worth the extra dollars...Navigation visually is  outstanding with large picture in front of drivers view & adjustable via steering wheel controls. Unfortunately the ease, ability to use navigation system overly complicated, frustrating and ends up i don't use it ...I use my phone. Such a waste of technology . Did they really have a focus group trying out the system? Not overly impressed with sound system , but BOSE upgrade pricy for sure...if you can afford it ...do it! Really like the panoramic large moon roof. All in all, and because of a ""year end special deal"" this Q7 was clear choice over the competition."
car_3427,A lot of car but a lot of money,"This is really an adult car and not a kid carrier.  I went for the adaptive chassis which gives the Q7 amazing road holding. This car is loaded with technology.  Audi should hold classes the way Apple does to familiarize the owner with everything this car is capable of doing. You have the ability to control all the cameras; that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360 degree views at will.  The driver's seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals; and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift; and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It's a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car's technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package."
car_3428,"It's relatively new but we love everything, almost","Update: Everything on the initial review still applies 5,000 miles later.Original review: This is a very high quality vehicle.  Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350; making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don't mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20"" tires (Goodyear) that our Prestige has so you have to wonder how many tire shops within a 50 mile radius would have a replacement tire in the event of a tire failure.  I read horror stories about ROF tires, but ride quality, noise, and handling are not an issue in the Q7.  Due to all the technology there will be a very steep learning curve."
car_3429,Comfortable Luxury but know what you're buying,"Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn't in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21"") on shows two manufacturers (Goodyear & Continental) with a price per tire near $500.  The interior is very nice.  The one drawback is the lack of storage bins.  There are only two small bins.  The one under the arm rest will hold a pair of sunglasses but leaves only a little room for anything else.  The CD player is located in the glove box so if you want to play a CD you have to load it before you start driving.  The virtual cockpit allows you to do many things without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  Functions like the radio and phone can be selected and controlled on the steering wheel so you don't have to look to the side to make a call or change the radio station.  The blind spot warning lights are on the side mirrors cover and are easier to see than just a small emblem on the mirror.  The speed limit for most streets is displayed on the instrument panel and the heads up display.  You can set a reminder that will cause the posted speed limit to flash if you exceed it more than the amount you set.  A very nice reminder in residential areas.  It also lets you know if you are in a school zone although it will still flash as if you are speeding even when school is not in session.  My wife has a very hard time pulling straight into a parking spot.  The parking assist will display your position in the parking spot so if you are at an angle or taking up two spots you can see it before you exit the car.  This is a great car (a little pricey) if you know the small shortcomings.After 5000 miles I still enjoy driving the Q7.  I love the heads up display.  I won't buy another care without it.  It took a little while to learn to use the adaptive cruise control and I don't drive on the freeway anymore without using it.  It does have a few quirks though.  The set speed automatically adjusts downward with a decreased speed limit which is good but it sometimes reduces speed even though there is no change in the speed limit.  This is especially true if the road had a long term construction project.  The cameras will also occasionally miss an increase in the posted speed so the speed sign will flash until you pass another speed sign and this can be for many miles.  The camera doesn't recognize all the signs indicating the end of a school zone so it will also flash until you finally come across another speed limit sign.  There are a  couple of irritants.  The drivers door has developed a rattle when driving over a slightly rough road and the dealership hasn't been able to fix.   (I didn't have this rattle after 100k miles on my Lexus SUV.)  Also the steering wheel is slightly ""off"" level.  That is if I put the steering wheel ""level"" the car will move to the right and it this includes driving in a parking lot.  The dealer checked the alignment and said it is ok but it still does it.  The backup sensor is nice but when I have a bike rack in the trailer hitch the warning tone is constant when backing up so you don't get a sense about how close you are to objects behind you based on the tone.  The car computes the estimated miles remaining before the next fill up but it tends to over estimate the gas mileage so it can be up to 100 miles  less than indicated on the display.  It is more noticeable when driving long distances on an interstate highway."
car_3430,No spare tire!,We enjoyed the test drive and were thinking serious about this SUV. Good looking and good finishes made this attractive in comparison to the X5 and GLE 350. Drove great.  We found the technology a little cumbersome but that could be expected as it was new to us but not as difficult as other test drives. The navigation voice commands could not recognize very much. The salesman indicated that it would get used to our voices. Right.  I checked this out with a current owner. He confirmed that voice commands are limited to his contact list.  The kicker for me was there was no spare tire! The salesman went looking for it and could not find it! It was sorta funny but it wasn't.  Their defense was it was equipped was run-flat tires with a 50 mile range. That may work for city slickers but we go to remote locations and that won't hunt. The  X5 also has no spare.  I understand that this is becoming more common but its not for me.
car_3431,Exciting only in Dynamic mode,"I have been considering this car, but I wanted to have a real testing experience before actually shelling out $60,000+.  So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions; as usual, the ""secret"" is to accelerate gradually.                        DRIVING EXPERIENCE: It is boring (Lexus RX 350 sort of feeling) in Auto mode. More exciting (BMW X5 sort of thing) in Dynamic mode. I was actually surprised by how agile and stable the car is going uphill at good speeds in Dynamic mode. A true Dr. Jeckyll  and Mr. Hide sort of personality.   The car is long, but parallel parking is actually easier than I was expecting. Mind you, I said easier and not easy. Without the rearview camera and at night in dark areas, it is not completely a ""piece of cake"". Driving uphill on serious pitches like in Old-Town San Diego was more pleasant that I hoped for. I was a tad concerned on some pitches when I had to come to a complete stop, but the car proved excellent.                                                                          NOISE: Wind noise in more than on the BMW X5, at least once I hit 80mph-ish.. Road noise is definitely low. Excellent in that sense.                                      INTERIORS It is well detailed, it not exceptionally luxurious, at least not in the Premium or Premium plus trims. Unfortunately, the Luxury package (another $6k) is available only in the Prestige trim.   The car is comfortable, but not exceptionally comfortable. I am 6'2"" and 245lbs, and on a 4 hour + driving I wished the car had a better support for my thighs . The seats feel comfortable, but after hours of driving, did not feel that comfy anymore.  The double shade panels in front are an excellent touch. I wonder why more cars do not have them since that is an inexpensive feature..                          INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions.  For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though).  The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking.  But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.   BRAKING.  It is overall fine, but in two instances I found myself wishing it could be a little more prompt. But that could just be me and the fact that I am used to a different car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            LIGHTS: The Q7 lighting system ranks among the good ones. Drove it at night on hilly and narrow roads with nothing in terms of street lights and I always felt that I had a good view of the road, in particular using the high beam lights.                                                                                                                        OVERALL GRADE (A-): It has about all a driver would want, but it is fun to drive only in Dynamic mode.  The visual luxury is all there, but it is not 100% comfortable."
car_3432,Can be improved... but still great overall,"Recently made a switch from '13 BMW X5 50i to a '17 Q7 Prem Plus. Great car with lots of updates in tech and safety. Comfortable and quiet. While the engine has the punch in 'dynamic' mode, it lacks in 'auto' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn't great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls. I have not been able to hit the manufacturer's gas mileage of 19 city/25 highway/21 combined. So far locally I am getting 15 mpg or less and 20 mpg on highways. This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet; curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I've been more critical than happy so far... I am just starting to get comfortable with the changes and hopefully it will get better over time. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle. Let's hope it is reliable and will last and retain good re-sale value."
car_3433,A big headache!,"I own a new 2017 Q7 for 7 months and it's currently 6500 miles. I love the esthetics and the drive but the electronics of this car are absolutely terrible! Don't buy this car! I have had  a steering wheel malfunction in this car 4 time where all the controls in the steering wheel stop working, -and next day everything is working again! . I took it to Audi 3 times and they can't figure it out! Also the rear camera doesn't work every time it rains. My volume button stopped working temporarily 3 times! My oil change light went off when it wasn't due for an oil change. The light went off the next day by itself.  There is a clicking noise everytime I start the car. Like a processor sound. I took the car to Audi and none of the issues where fixed yet.  I am planning to apply to lemon laws."
car_3434,hesitation,The Q7 2015 has inconsistent hesitation upon acceleration  which is a safety concern when pulling into traffic.  Not a happy Audi buyer.
car_3435,I am glad I made right choice.,"I was looking a car for couple months. I compared SUVs from Volvo, Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lexus. Audi Q7 is the best one."
car_3436,Two weeks review - Still in the honeymoon,"Car is super easy to drive. Super quiet too. Any size concerns related to parking go away with the visual package and the 360 view. As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.10k update: Car keeps driving great and fuel economy got to 21.5 miles/gal. Two minor issues: climate control cannot be synch-ed from the driver controls, you have to manually do it. You have to look at the temperature in the second row as well. Not ideal for a car of this price. One of the speakers will have to be changed as it has a raspy sound in some specific range. It will be covered under the warranty. All things considered, still very happy. Pleasure to drive.20k update. Very pleased with the car. All works as expected. Pleasure to drive. I bounce between the auto and comfort drive mode. Fuel economy a little above 22 mpg now. I extended the satellite radio service. I have not extended the Audi google map and news service, I think that it is too expensive and they should offer a more competitive price or maybe separate the google map connectivity from the rest of the features. Without the google map service your navigation system works but it is not smart. It will not update route based on traffic. If you want that you will need to use the Apple service through car play."
car_3437,"2017-12-13 Update after 16,000 miles","This car drives great.  It's electronics are far inferior to that on my Lincoln MKT.  The navigation system suddenly reboots during trips.  The voice activated system apparently only speaks German, as it doesn't understand English.  6/12/17:  Pros:  Car drives great on a long trip, and gets good mileage.  Averaged better than 25 mpg on 780 mile trip from Georgia to Maryland.  Comfort better than average.  Excellent braking system.  Cons:  Repeated navigation system failures where the system suddenly ""reboots"" while driving!  Of course, Audi cannot replicate in the shop!  All data is lost and the trip has to be re-programmed into the system.  Car still leaks going through a car wash.  Audi solution, turn off the A/C when in a car wash!  Key fob suddenly stopped recognizing the car.  Audi reprogrammed.  Said ""it happens sometimes.""  Self-leveling system pump is so loud when it runs it can be heard above the radio, and I am partially deaf!  It sounds like someone is filling a tire with air!  There is no dip stick to check the oil.  You have to turn on the car, and page through the settings to find the ""check oil screen.""  Then it will tell you the oil level, sometimes.  Other times it doesn't seem to work.  The technology on this car is great, when it works.  I have had multiple failures and many more problems then I ever had on my Lincoln MKT.  This is my first and last Audi.12/11/16:  My car was returned from service for this issue after 14 days in the shop.  The mechanic's comments on my receipt follow:   ""Took vehicle thru car wash with A/C on. Found water coming from the bottom of the dash. Removed wiper cowl cover and air intake ducting. No damage to seals or evidence of leaking. Ran vehicle thru car wash again using borascope to watch inside housing intake. Found when foam from car wash hits it is sucked into the vent box. Removed housing from another vehicle and found it did the same thing. Contacted product support. Was advised this condition is ""normal"" and vehicle needs to be in recirculation mode or A/C OFF while going through a car wash!""So according to Audi those of us living in the south should turn off our A/C or put it in recirculation mode to go through a car wash?  This is my 20th new automobile.  I have never had to do any such thing with any other brand.  I'll be trading back to Lincoln next year.  I miss my MKT.This is my first Audi.  I have always purchased Lincolns, but they discontinued the MKT.  I traded my 2011 MKT on a new 2017 Audi Q7 equipped nicely with $66,000 worth of bells and whistles.  I should have kept the MKT!  I first noticed the car leaking when my wife and I drove it through a car wash and water dripped onto her feet.  We returned to the dealer in Jacksonville.  After many hours they reported they could not ""replicate"" the problem.  They said they blew out all the drains, etc. and hopefully our problem was solved.  10 days go by and I visit the car wash again.  Drip, drip, drip into the passenger cabin with about a cup of water during a 2 minute trip through the automated car wash!  I filed a written complaint with the dealer and management.  The service writer called me (not a peep from anyone in management).  He had the car picked up at my home (117 miles from the dealership).  It has been there 7 days now and the last report I received on Thursday (today is Sunday) is that they were going to drive it through a car wash!  No kidding?  It has not rained since I purchased the car.  We are about to take it on a 1500 mile trip to see the grandkids.  I am extremely worried the car will flood if we run into rain!  This is supposed to be a LUXURY automobile!  The electronics are flaky for the radio, and the navigation system is a throw back to the system I had in my Lincoln in 2006!  No touch screen!  A stupid knob to turn to enter data one character at a time!  The MMI system works sometimes, other times it doesn't seem to connect unless I turn off the car, and restart it.  The entertainment system has crashed and rebooted several times without explanation.  As I stated earlier, this is my first Audi.  It will also be my last.  Poor dealer service and response, a leaky brand new luxury automobile, and no response whatsoever from management.  Do yourself a favor and find another vehicle."
car_3438,2017 Audi Prestige W/Air suspension review,"Absolutely love the car. I've only had it since October 9th, but it has a great feeling of quality and solidity. The interior is well made and of high quality components. Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW's comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It's quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn't. Also, because Audi doesn't make enough of the Q7's, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit. (Pretty much plan on no incentives and no discount on price) Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, and would do it again.Starting just over 10,000 Miles, the brakes started making a horrible squeaking and squealing noise coming to a stop and backing up. VERY LOUD. Audi dealer says Audi NA is aware and working on a fix.... I’m still driving around with it noisy and unacceptable."
car_3439,Better Than Even the Best Reviews,"If you are interested in this vehicle you likely have read the many terrific reviews from Motorweek, Car and Driver, and even Consumer Reports. I certainly did. I was able to get the vehicle at a small discount which was lucky as some dealers are now asking above sticker or loading on even more packs. The car is a joy to drive and while some have compared the ""Virtual Cockpit"" to a video game, I find it helpful and very effective at communicating information, which is what a dash should do. The placement of controls is excellent, and they are well organized by function. The volume control for all uses (voice, phone, audio) is delightfully located on the console where one's hand naturally falls. The shifter takes a while to get used to, but Audi seems to have anticipated a learning curve. When I first owned it I tried to put it in reverse without stepping on the brake pedal. The dash lit up to inform me I needed to do so. There are a few issues. First, interior storage for the driver is simply unavailable. The console holds virtually nothing and there is not even a sunglass holder. The absences of cubbies is a disappointment, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have had two minor problems. First, one day the alarm system went off every time I tried to lock the vehicle. The dealer (only a mile away, happily) was able to remedy this in less than an hour. Second, the steering wheel is no longer centered after only 2,500 miles. That, too, will be corrected by the dealer. Overall, it's a terrific vehicle as far as I am concerned, despite minor issues.Update, April 2017: Car sat for much of the winter as I had to have emergency back surgery. As soon as I was able, I was driving again, and my very positive impression of the driver's seat was reconfirmed the moment I sat in it again. Very supportive, but not confining. Was able to drive 6 hours (with breaks) and no discomfort. Got stuck in stop-and-go traffic entering Chicago (no surprise) and the Traffic Jam Assist feature, previously untested, worked perfectly. Very impressive. With cruise control set at 73 I got a steady 26+ MPG. Around town am averaging about 22.5. Overall, VERY pleased with vehicle.Update, October 2017: Still very happy with this vehicle. The longer I own it, the more impressed I am with the subtle benefits of Audi's technology. The touch pad works very well, and the audio is amazing. I still remain slightly irritated by the absence of small-item storage for the driver. After 15 months, the build quality is evident. I am delighted overall."
car_3440,Car is just alright.,"I've switched from Mercedes. Handling is nicer, not as nice as BMW though. Cabin is very quiet. First impression is amazing. Nicely designed and finished. As soon as you start driving it you realize run flat tires destroy the comfort you may like from Mercedes. Head up display, as Paul already mentioned, produces ugly glares on a windscreen, right in front of you, distracting and destroying the whole experience of having a head up display technology. The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn't help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector. Driver assistance package seems like an interesting enhancement but the car doesn't fully stop itself as advertised. You better read about all the limitations etc. The last one and a very annoying issue it the air-conditioning. The level of the noise the funs produce on a sunny days is hard to bear.  If I had the money in my pocket again I would seriously consider other vehicles like GLS or XC90. Perhaps this is what I'm going to do. Wait for the new GLS and trade it in. Good luck."
car_3441,problems,"I love my Q7, but I'm having problems already and have only owned it since the end of June. The hatch has a tendency to not to want to open and it makes a screeching noise when it does open. You have to try and pull it up enough to shut it so you can try and open it again. I've had it in for a fix and all they did was a master reset. What good is that really going to do?? Ha, nothing, as it is happening again. I'm pretty sure the pre sense is not working. I've had a couple close calls where it should have and it didn't work.  But they tell me it is. I've just started having issues with the key remembering my settings. I have had to push the button several times now to get it where I have it set for me.  I'm wondering if I made a mistake buying this Audi. :( I got rid of my explorer because I was constantly bringing it in for the same problems they couldn't seem to get fixed right. I don't want to have to be doing that again!"
car_3442,An honest feedback.,"Head up display optics produce glares which at times can be very distracting. They can be small i.e. two bright points or it can appear as two bright lines, or (pretty bad) large and very bright, and rather large (size of a credit card) spot. If you live in California or any other place with plenty of sun, test drive the car in the middle of the day and make sure you can live with this issue. This alone can be a road block. Side mirrors produce a high pitch noise. Turn off the radio while test driving and listen carefully to the mirrors. In windy days it can be very obvious and annoying. Driver assistance system is far worse than the one you can find on a brand new Volvo XC 90. It is confirmed by IIHS. Test drive both cars and you will see what I mean. Major concerns on quality of the materials used. This may not be a perfect option for demanding person paying attention to details."

car_3445,Q7 redesign is missing simple options,"I just bought the 2017 Q7.  It's disturbing that the skimped on some of the features found on lesser vehicles.  Here's my bucket list of the features that this car should have came with:  1.  Remote start from key fob.  2.  Convex overhead mirror (to watch the kiddos in the back)  3.  Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.  Driver's key pad for vehicle entry (Ford may be the only company doing this).  5.  Sunglass holder (pretty simple option).   6.  Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I'm happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.  Run flats are a huge disadvantage all around.  I haven't got into the maintenance phase yet, but I'll update my post at that time."
car_3446,Love  it,Love  it
car_3447,NAVIGATION SUCKS EVEN MORE WITH USE,"The navigation system is poor and confusing. You have to manually change state location even if have driven there.  The electronic handbrake can be activated while car is in gear - very dangerous. Map/ Navigation systems poorly described.  Manual describes all options, not what is available in that vehicle - very confusing. After 6 months, the confusion between map and navigation systems remains a major, stupid problem."
car_3448,Q7 test drive,"Nice car. Being in texas, I didn't  like the perforated  sun roof cover"
car_3449,In the shop 7 times for Sunroof/rattling issues,"Poorly made,  bad fit and finish in interior. Horrible rattling after only 1500 mi. God knows what this car will sound like a year from now. This car was rushed to market, not ready for primetime. If you do not mind a car that will rattle over every bump, then this is your car, But if that sort of thing bothers you?- RUN dont' buy"
car_3450,Refreshed Q7,The new Audi Q7 is more nimbler and more comfortable than its predecessor. Once in the vehicle it is hard not to take it out for a long drive. I am hoping Audi has invested in good parts and produce better reliability.
car_3451,Probably the best 3 row SUV,"My wife and I drove every minivan and 3 row crossover.  Rather than going into the pros and cons of every one, I will just say we chose the Q7 because of its tremendous balance between ride and handling, its superior quietness and solid feeling, and combined comfort of the first and second rows.  We also suspect that the Audi will be more reliable than the Volvo XC90 (although the Volvo is somewhat less expensive, has superior interior design and has a more comfortable first and third row).   While the Q7 cost more money than we needed to spend, I believe it is worth every dollar.  So do many others.  In my area, every Q7 was spoken for.  I purchased mine from a dealer 200 miles away,"
car_3452,Audi at it's Finest,"This is the first Audi we've owed and love it!  We’ve been loyal fans of Mercedes and Range Rovers over the past few years and were looking for a 7 passenger vehicle as our kids are in various sporting activities. We are only a month in and really impressed with the gas mileage.  Spacious vehicle, comfortable ride and handles the road well. I will admit I do like the body style of the older versions as I like to sit up a little higher similar to an SUV, but so far, no other complaints."
car_3453,2017 Audi Q7,"This car is a huge improvement from my previous 2014 Q7.  Drives like a car, loaded with technology, and has a great interior with high quality finish.  A little pricey, but so far very happy with the purchase."
car_3454,Amazing ride,I have to say that the 2017 Q7 premium plus is a great ride.   I am really impressed with the virtual cockpit integration.   It was a great buy.
car_3455,Best Vehicle I Have Owned,"I replaced a 2011 Q7 S-Line with 100,000 miles with the new 2017.  I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user interface to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang & Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG at average driving speeds of around 75MPH.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range is just as good on the 2017 despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  The keyless entry is still bizarre and its built in ""safety features"" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  The ability to utilize the map on the driver's dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry is still bizarre, the logic behind the ""personal safety feature "" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  I am frequently cussing out some unknown Audi programming or product management team somewhere unknown....  My advice to the Audi programming team is to go try a Lexus keyless entry system, it always works and lets you in the car.  Also, I have given up on the  hands free tailgate opening.  I end up dancing in the parking lot and ultimately just pull out the remote.Seating comfort with the luxury package is excellent and highly configurable.Probably the biggest improvement is in the longevity of the tires and brakes.  I currently have 53,000 miles on the vehicle and I still have 6-7 mm of tread remaining on the original factory Eagle Sport runflats and minimal wear on the original brake pads.  I am very happy with the OEM tires in all weather conditions and they have been great in the Wisconsin weather.So far my only three complaints or observations are:1,) Aforementioned keyless entry and hands free tailgate programming issues. 2.) The tilt steering does not go down close enough to my legs for my own personal taste, seems to stop in too high (straight) of a setting.3.) On an overcast or partially sunny day it seems like the auto fan setting wants to stay in too high of a setting and basically makes you feel cold and also creates more noise than necessary.Overall the vehicle is excellent and I enjoy my daily drive."
car_3456,Wow! Best Car I've Ever Owned,"We spent month looking at, researching, and reading about the 2017 Q7.   This car has exceeded our expectations in all categories.  Beautiful to look at, easy to drive, and comfortable for all passengers.  The Q7 is roomy enough for trips to the big box store, while feeling like a comfy sports car.  My Porsche driving husband is impressed by the handling at highway speeds and in parking lots.  The rear seats provided more than ample leg room for two 6'+ passengers.  I love all the creature comforts and goodies: get the Premium Plus!"
car_3457,OMG!  The 2017 Audi Q7  Is it a dream ?,"The safety driving features are the best part of the Audi except the shear joy of driving it!  I have over 41,000 miles on my car in less that a year and a half and you need all of the protection you can get on the road these days!  Smooth, comfortable, great maneuverability!    You might be making a BIG mistake if you don't try this one out yourself!"
car_3458,Run Flats??? WTF did you ruin a fantastic car??,"I was considering it, and it was my top choice until I found out they only come with Run Flats. After my experience with Run Flats on a Toyota, I will NEVER AGAIN own a car on Run Flats. They ride poorly, have no milage warranty, last half as long as other tires, and are EXPENSIVE to replace. Sorry Audi, I LOVE My A5 Cabrio, but will now buy someone else's car just because of the Run Flats."
car_3459,full of tech,"a very nice car, perhaps a little overwhelming in the technology it offers. Drives well, smooth low speed manners, very nice handling (within the limits of a short test drive). Feels like a hell of a lot of vehicle, though I would be somewhat concerned about maintenance costs when out of warranty - there's a hell of a lot of mechanical and electrical equipment in the car."
car_3460,Best Car I Have Ever Owned,"I spent a ton of time researching and comparing the Q7 with the 2016 BMW X5 and the Volvo XC90. I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car & Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner's manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn't up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can't even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile. I love this SUV!"
car_3461,"not impressed, it looks like a tall station-wagon","Overall it's a nice car, Drivers seat is comfortable, so as second row, however the third row is more like a jump seat for 5-8 year old. AUDI is happy to a nonce  about shaving over 350 pounds, well it comes with crappy third row NO leg room, and NO head room !? There's no other option then run flat tires!? which ONLY available with one of THE WORSE in the market GoodYear tires, so you'll be luck to get 18K miles on it! Road noise and handling, again - crappy GoodYear tires,  no improvement on gas mileage, DO NOT be fool of that streaker 19/25 mpg, you're still getting about 16/22 mpg, and about 19 mpg in the suburbs, again it could be the GoodYear's run-flat's which are terrible, a specialty in the ice or snow conditions, do your self a favor and stay home."
car_3462,Love it,"We have had the car for a couple weeks - Orca Black/Black Interior/Prestige Trim. I spent quite some time with the X5, Volvo XC90, MB GLE, Acura MDX, etc. and this car hands down performed better in my opinion. The interior is stunning though the exterior is a bit tame. Although it is still very early, we haven't had any problems and the service at our Audi dealership has been fantastic. This car is a replacement to a Q5 TDI we have had for a few years, also zero issues."
car_3463,Glitchy!!!,"No sooner than I pull out of dealer lot,  a warning light goes off... The next day another one, then the third day the first light goes out by itself, but I get another, then the transmission got stuck in park at school drop off line with lots of angry parents behind me, windshield wipers went to and stayed in service position, I got out and pushed them back down. They were inoperable until about the fourth time I restarted the car. That seems to be the trend, I get different warnings for things that are not an issue, low windshield washer fluid that is full, low tire pressure, etc.... It's like rebooting your computer, I have found that after a series of restarts, the glitches end up clearing.....Price paid? Too much for this much headache.....The car is comfortable but after 8 days of ownership, Im not happy at all, give me my 2012 Q7 back.......anyone in the market for a lightly used Q7???  I would not buy again."
car_3464,Best Q7 - Audi took their time and did it right!,"I recently purchased new 2017 Audi Q7 Prestige.  I went with the prestige package since it includes cold weather, warm weather, 20"" wheels, and the vision packages for a better overall value.  As a previous owner of a 2013 Audi Q7 I was immediately impressed with the way the 2017 model feels in regards to handling, steering feel, and performance.  The 2017 model has shaved off 500+ lbs from the previous platform and makes the Q7 feel more like a car.  The 3 Liter engine has plenty of power (333hp), smooth shifts from the 8-spd transmission, and great road grip with little body roll.  I would describe the 2017 Q7 as nimble,  something I could never say about the previous Q7 model - which felt more like a tank.  I look forward to driving the Q7 everyday, and right now im looking for excuses to go take it out just so I can drive it.  Audi took a long time to re-design the Q7, but I think they got everything right: style, performance, comfort, and technology."
car_3465,Switched to Audi from BMW,"My wife and I have owned primarily BMW products for the last 25 years until my wife leased a VW Tiguan three years ago.  I drove it from time to time and was impressed so when it was time to replace a 2012 X5 I looked at the redesigned Q7.  The ride, handling, and performance is as good or better than the X5 and the fit and finish is far superior.  It has a little more room inside while not seeming to be larger on the outside.  The ride is a little less harsh and more quiet than the X5.  Handling install responsive and the turning radius is excellent.  It is a joy to drive.  It is also easier to fit multiple sets of golf clubs horizontally in the cargo area.  I have had the car for about a month and so far no problems.  Everything works well.  The 2017 redesign is a great improvement over the previous model.  Can't say enough good things about this vehicle."
car_3466,Keep looking,Nothing but problems. The truck has now 62000 miles. Expect to change tires and brakes often. High pressure fuel pump went at 45k. The exhaust system had a leak at 60k. Bulbs go out frequently.  No way to reset the service intervals without visiting your dealer or spend $$$ for a vag-com cable or pay the dealer. Expect to pay a lot for regular maintenance at the dealer.
car_3467,Finally sold the Lemon,"We bought our 2009 Audi Q7 in 2013. We had it a month before it started to have problems. AC went out and then within 4 months the was water getting into the electronic module. We paid 6000 dollars for a full repair. After about two months, it happened again and Audi said they couldn't warranty it because of all of the water. Now, nothing electronic works in the car. The screen, radio, navigation, airbags and fried the battery multiple times. Headlights and taillights have probably been replaced about 10 times in three years. DONT BUYTHIS CAR"
car_3468,Great used SUC,It feels a heavy truck but feel very fuel efficient.  I went on a full tank to Canada from NJ.
car_3469,lemon,"From the start of this new car i did everything audi, maintenance,  repairs, parts. After 95,000 it star to ed falling  apart. Not counting maintenance,  brakes every 15000, tires every 25,000,  i just spent $7800 on parts and labor. A car should last a bit longer then 100000 miles."
car_3470,a beautiful lemon,"I have had this car/truck/suv for 6 years now. 
Pros:
First of all, a lot of people come up and tell me how cool looking this car is. A lot of folks take pics too.
Second, - the car has awesome 4WD on ice and the way it handles overtaking(passing) and gets a vroom is nice.
third- the interiors are awesome looking.

Cons:
a) While under warranty the battery broke, the amplifier broke, the no sensor broke, some other  electrical issues.
b) as soon as the 4 year warranty ended, the ad-blue pump broke malfunctioned and had to be replaced for 2000 bucks.
c) on its 5 year run- the a/c compressor broke costing 3000 repairs, the rear light holder burnt, front lights broke...lemon. don't buy"
car_3471,Had a car for over three years love/hate,"When the car has no problems it runs great, performance is very good, ride control is spectacular ride conform on the rough side.

Problems i had included water inside the car because of poor design for drain pipes coming from the roof lines. All of the electronics went out, had it fixed under pre-owned warranty but had to hassle to get it done. Audi was trying to convince me that it was my problem that I did not clean the drain pipes, very hard to do especially if you don't have a large garage with tons of space. Audi dealer fixed only one drain pipe the rear still collecting water in the trunk area after a car wash.

Rear tailgate stopped functioning, closes by itself, super dangerous."
car_3472,Great Suv,"Drives smooth plenty of pick up despite posts stating otherwise. Quattro awd system is great in bad weather and with the correct tires almost unstoppable in snow. Seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room for the whole family. 20,000 miles and the brakes and tires are fine. I have seen posts stating otherwise but it has to do with how the car is driven. The tires will be good until 50,000 miles. Also fuel economy is not great but if you can afford the car then you can afford the gas otherwise buy a Yaris."
car_3473,Bad decision,"Have driven LR3, X5 and Q7. Q7 just doesn't seem to be the same quality.Many problems - breaks wear out extremely quickly, rear lift gate problems (twice), MPG is not as advertised based on my calcs, nterior feels cramped, ergonomically uncomfortable. Teen kids keep asking when can we get a new SUV.We end up driving our BMW sedan to local ski resorts, beaches.Can't wait for lease to be over."
car_3474,"Nice Car, Loads of Rattles","Purchased my Q7 in Aug 0f '09 and on the third day of ownership an annoying rattle developed in the sunroof, then in one of the rear quarter panels, then in the tailgate and eventually the second row seats.  Now my $60K dream car sounds like a Yugo on a logging road.  Overall I'm very pleased with the quality and performance of the Q7, but believe that Audi needs to dedicate more attention to the fit and finish of interior materials.  Heading down to Portland today to trade the noisy beast for a luxury car that actually rides and sounds like a luxury car.  Too Bad."
car_3475,Squeaking brakes & Bad Audi Srvice,"I bought Q7 July 2009. Brought it back to dealer immediately for squeaking brakes, not just regular squeak but the kind that people outside look over at your car-was told its normal due to heavy vehicle, could be humidity. I have AudiCare & have repeatedly asked brakes to be inspected at ea visit.  was told to spray a hose directly at brakes to reduce squeak. brought it back in around 25k miles - Service Dept told me to get on open road, drive as fast as i could without taking out a kid (yes, it's what they said) and brake quickly a few times.  Really?! I just want to feel like Audi stands by their product. I thought I'd feel happy that we worked hard to  buy this car. I feel ""duped"" by Audi."
car_3476,Superb Quality-Design-Performance,"Excellent quality, thoughtful design, excellent performance and great mileage. Doesn't drive or smell like your Dad's diesel. Highly recommend for price/value ratio. Will likely exceed your expectations as it did mine - 115 mph cruising UP a 30% grade mountain road, quite,no rattles and so smooth like butter excellent feel on the wheel. No American car can compete on quality or value for a dollar. I've owned new Porsche and several new Mercedes 360SD, 450SL and 560SL - Regardless of money, I'd rather own this car, and that is saying a lot. Reading this you might get the impression I am not a tough critic, you would be wrong."
car_3477,Audi - junk...No service Do not buy!,"Starting from first miles till now (10k) brakes are making crazy noise. Dealer did not find any problem. But you know what is best? Customer service of Audi. They answered that this is normal because they use some new materials of braking pads. And it gives more noise than other cars. So it is normal for Audi that their 55k$ new car is giving noise on street like some 20 years junk worse 500 bucks. Do not buy Audi, do not support awful company which do not want to help its customers in any way. My is going to trade in next month."
car_3478,Uneven Quality,"There really are a lot of things to like about this car.  For an SUV, it handles like a car and is much more comfortable of a drive than most of the other luxury SUVs on the road.  However, there are a couple of things that really are unacceptable for a 60,000 car.  1. cheap plastic all over interior (see plastic foot rest just to the left of the brake pedal that cracked within a year) 2. doors are really cheap vs. bmw or mercedes. witnessed firsthand when I broke a interior mechanism in door opening on icy morning  3. MMI - why a cup holder right above a non-sealed system? 2 oz of gatorade fried out my track wheel to the tune of 800 4. handles HORRIBLY in the snow!!! 5. fuel mlg stinks"
car_3479,Serviced more than in my driveway!,"Mechanically fine. Technically STINKS! MMR system, brains of car for radio, bluetooth, navigation, cameras etc., has been non-working 4 times. Front headlight blown 2 times. Window non- working. 4 Bald tires at 13,000 miles. Service takes no responsibility. Loaner car a tiny little barely 4 passenger car, paid for a Q7 that seats 7! WHAT A PIECE OF MODERN JUNK!"
car_3480,My Best SUV ever,"I love this car.  The diesel engine is quiet and the mileage is exceptional.  I normally average about 24 in combined driving.  I hardly use the 3rd row except for stuff (I couldn't even get back there to try it out). What I love most is the driving experience.  Everything is at your fingertips and the dash layout is intuitive.  I would recommend this car for anyone looking for great mileage, fantastic driving experience, and great service."
car_3481,Love my Tdi,"I have owned this fine vehicle for about 8,000 miles and I absolutely love it.  Aside from everything a luxury vehicle provides, this thing is quite frugal.  On long highway trips, I commonly see 27 to 29 mpg.  Driving from my home in Minneapolis to downtown St. Paul, I see MPG readings from 24 to 29 depending on how heavy traffic is.  Although the HP is lower than the V6 gas or the V8 gas engines, the torque is quite substantial and I have never felt that the vehicle was underpowered in any way.  Towing a 23’ fishing boat around really exemplifies the advantage of large torque numbers. The Q7 has a super quiet interior, very comfortable.  If you are looking at the Q7, get the Tdi."
car_3482,q7 Diesel,"I've had this vehicle a little over 3 moths and really enjoy driving it.  Fit and finish on interior are excellent. Seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Handling is very good for a vehicle of this size.  Fuel economy has been better than expected.  I have about 5000 miles on vehicle and my combined average is 22.5 mpg - with mostly around town driving.  Regularly get 27-28 mpg on highway @ 75 mph and I have actually achieved over 30 mpg on a couple of longer, purely highway trips.  3rd row is very tight on legroom - really just for kids.  2nd row does adjust fore and aft to provide some slight relief for 3rd row passengers."
car_3483,It's a beaut!,I bought this car 3 months ago and now have 5000 miles on it.  Every one of those miles has been a pleasure to drive.  Who knew an SUV could be so much fun?  We've taken it on a couple camping trips already and it handled beautifully on the windy roads headed in to the mountains.  It's a feeling of confidence taking tight turns in a big car with very little body lean.  I'll be turning it in for its first scheduled maintenance this week and I have not had any problems yet.  This car also has plenty of room for our family of four with 2 little kids.  We also use the 3rd row frequently while carpooling with our friends' kids. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a luxury SUV.
car_3484,A Lot of Time In The Shop,"At the last minute we signed a lease on this car thinking we would pay it off at the end of the lease term. The first two years we had it, it was in the shop every other month. There was a problem with the AC and they kept breaking other things trying to fix it. By the time it was 'stabilized,' I hated the car.  I love the way it drives and the way it looks, but I did not pay all this money to put it in the shop and drive a Hyundai.  We are eager to turn it in and put this experience behind us. We will most likely be going back to Toyota or Volvo.  I felt like the interior had a lot of plastic parts for the price.   All-in-all, my first luxury car did not turn out to be so luxurious."
car_3485,OK Car - Won't Buy Again,"Car design and comfort are great.  Service, reliability and build quality are weak.  If you must have this car, you will be taking a gamble as it seems that most people will come across at least one or two issues.  Maintenance is expensive.  Can't complain about fuel economy as you know what you are getting into.  Compared to other heavy cars, about the average.  The Audi Care Maintenance package only covers scheduled maintenance.  Loved the car for the first two years, then things started to fall apart."
car_3486,Love this car,"It is a great SUV if you need the space for the kids. I had a Lexus Rx 350, great car but a little boring to drive. I also has infinity Fx, Fun to drive but i needed more room. I find the Audi Q has it all, comfort, roomy, unique.. not as many Q7 as lexus and mercedes."
car_3487,Pleasure on my trips,I have been traveling about 450 miles 3 or 4 times each month for the last 5 years on business and pleasure. I love the fact the I am never as fatigued now as I was when I started these junkets 5 years ago in my first SUV. I have to hand it the German manufacturer. The vehicle is definitely designed for fun driving and long hauling. I also find that it handles much better in the parking lot than my previous 2 SUVs - they seem like real tanks compared to this. I purchased the Audi Care package so all of my services visits are covered by Audi. I have 21k miles now and have not spent anything on the Q7 yet.
car_3488,Audi versus Acura,Prior to purchasing my Audi Q7 I owned an Acura Mdx (2007) for 2 years. So I can't help but make comparisons. In my view the Audi is a better looking car inside and out. It also is the better riding of the two at highway speeds (75 mph and up for sure).  It feels more like a sports sedan. Audi is geared lower than the Acura (raising the rpms considerably)  The interior really is top of it's class as well.  But the Audi's navigation system is completely inferior to Acura's nav.  Smaller screen size and the absence of Acura's joystick like control makes a huge difference  Audi's system is simply frustrating to use. I give it a D.
car_3489,Audi Q7 PRESTIGE S-LINE,"This vehicle has one of the best factory stereo systems I have ever heard.  The original owner paid for the $6300.00 optional Bang & Olsen 14 speaker, 1000 watt digital amp system.  The front dash speakers both raise up out of the dash for proper staging and clarity.  All of the speakers have aluminum grilles and sound amazing no matter what type of music you prefer.  The vehicle has the 295/35/21 in tires mounted on 21×10in wheels that give the vehicleft an aggressive stance and look.  I love the vehicle but my wife wants something smaller.  We are considering the 2016 BMW M4 M edition and the Audi SQ5 S-Line.  I wish this vehicle was mine but I bought it for my wife and she wants to trade it towards something smaller."
car_3490,New to 35K review,"Phenominal vehicle.The engine delights me still. Lots of torque, feels sporty despite its size.7000 lb towing capacity, seats 7 and will get 32 mpg on the highway. There's a 400 mile stretch of desert through AZ and NM where I've done this twice!Gets almost as good mileage, in town, as my A8 gets on the highway. love the wifi hotspot, thought it was a silly gimmick, but my wife uses it with the iPad often. Wifi is tmobile so coverage isn't great but it's great for looking at restaurant reviews and researching hotels etc. Love the google driven Nav.The satellite overview makes exploring easier and adds visual interest.Makes driving at night and in the rain more engaging."
car_3491,Really impressed....Love my Q7,I thought I'd wait until I hit around 1 year before I left a review.It's been about 1 year since I bought my Q7 TDI and I thought I'd share my thoughts on it.I've been very happy with the Q7.Originally I wasn't planning on going with the TDI but the dealership happened to have one in stock on their showroom floor and it had all the features that I wanted.It would have taken about 2 months to custom order one so I decided to go with the TDI even though it was more expensive.
car_3492,Amazing,"It is beautiful, fast (I'm gonna get a ticket... I can just tell), quiet- the only thing I can hear is the 1,000 watt B and O system that puts music into your soul, advanced technology- that will take me years to figure out... have I mentioned it is a head turning German engineered machine?"
car_3493,Perfect Q7?,"If performance is critical,  you really need to verify you are getting the 333hp engine.  Very confusing and I missed it.  I think that you are limited to the Prestige package.?"
car_3494,"24,000 Trouble Free miles","Highway mileage great, city not so great. Third row access is tight. Solid feel."
car_3495,Q7 Love!,"I'm in my third q7 and I cannot get enough. Frankly, the vehicle has no flaws...and trust me, I look for them!"
car_3496,best Euro SUV on market,"Bought Q7 TDI 3.0 used in 2014 with 25k miles. Exterior styling is very Euro-slique. LED headlight design is very eye-catching and bright. Crisp ride with almost no vibration or wind noise but a little harsh. I traded out tires for Pirelli scorpions and dropped recommended psi and that has helped. Still rides less cushy than Tahoe or Yukon and especially our Escalade which we traded. The interior is scandanavian like minimalist with easy buttons but lacks a factory DVD player option and any rear factory monitors for entertainment and rear seat climate control that is worth a darn. That's a fail for Volkswagen/audi in my opinion since the Tahoe, Suburban and Escalade have a movie theatre quality rear entertainment system and rear heated and colled seats now. What you get with Audi is impeccable materials. Fit and finish is exceptional. Eveything in cabin is tied down, no rattles like US SUVs. Also, they use REAL leather in seats, not ""pleather"" like US brands. That means the seats actually last and wear over time and dont crack and lose tanning like our Cadillac did. Rear luggage space with 6 people is inadequate. Third row seats only big enough for 7 year old. Cant get two pieces of luggage behind 3rd row seats. Had to buy $800 roof rack. All that said here are the pros...acceleration with turbo diesel is nasty! Once it revs up it just goes like a stabbed rat. 0-60 in close to 5.5! At 75-80 highway it sips fuel. We have seen actual Mpg of 36 and close to 550 miles between fill ups. This engine is superior to any US diesel even in the Fords! I know they may have ""fudged"" on emission reports but I have to say (california tree huggers) worth it!! We have 100k on vehicle now and maintenance has been a problem. It has developed bladder control issues like all my prior Germans and leaks oil all over garage. Dealership said they could replace gasket between engine and trans to fix for a meer $7k. I'll get a drip pan...tnx. It also chews up tires like a 5th grader goes through tennis shoes. The Quattro does not allow a slip like other US AWDs and it takes 2mm of tread off every tight turn. It also consumes brakes like a teenage boy goes through food. Two complete sets of brakes (dealer will not turn rotors?!) in 3 years at $2200 a pop!!! No bueno...volkswagen needs to abandon Bosch and talk to Raybestos or Brembo.  Overall amazing engine and impeccable attention to detail with interior finish, but add 10% to sticker price for post warranty and all maintenance. Its a pricey ride.Update on Q7: the car has now crossed 120k miles. We have had more engine problems and it has been back to dealer twice. We are considering buy-back with VW/Bosch class action for the emissions fraud. We love the gas mileage with the 3.0T diesel and the interior and exterior are holding up very well with little signs of wear. But the vehicle maintenance and reliability is starting to become a problem. Unfortunately, it seems to be following the tradition of my other German autos after 100k where they start to break frequently and the out of warranty repair bills become astronomical. Seeing at least $1100 per visit or more with $120/hour labor charges. We have friends with identical vehicle and they are at the same conclusion. Disappointed with overall experience of ownership with this vehicle, hoped it would hold up better than BMWs. VW needs to work with dealers to drop labor charges and high ownership maintenance costs and build them with more reliable parts."
car_3497,Very pleased with my Q7 TDI,"Wanted to wait until after my first required service for a true evaluation of the Q7. Bought my Q7 TDI after driving/considering the X5D, ML350 Bluetec, Toureg TDI. Only the TDI provided me with the space I needed in cargo area and fairly useable 3rd row, even if only occasionally. I have my own soccer training business and none of the others would fit my gear without much struggle. Close 2nd were the ML, which rode wonderfully, and the X5D which felt very much like a BMW. The Audi is a great combo of all the things I needed. Very powerful, quiet, and tremendous gas mileage! Came from an '07 MDX where I struggled to get 330 miles from full tank, I now get that on a half tank! **Update 7/2016...Still love the Q7! The only thing that I would improve is the WiFi. Hope they have improved it for 2016 because mine is awful. Nine out of ten times I have to take it off WiFi if I'm trying to stream music because it can't do it. Other than that, it's been a great vehicle for us.**Update 1/2017 Cancelled the Audi Connect which provided the WiFi through Sprint. Total waste of money. Hope it's improved. Had my first mechanical failure since purchase in 4/2013. Blower fan for climate control died, unfortunately during the coldest weather of winter so far. Audi Chantilly was awesome as usual and was replaced under the extended warranty I purchased. Other than that, still love the truck. Sadly disappointed the TDIs have been eliminated for the foreseeable future. Will consider trading in on a new diesel if they ever come out with one."
car_3498,Best SUV you can buy,"The 2013 Audi Q7 is a great SUV.It has great power, handling, and safety you can ever ask for.It has plenty of room for hauling the family around including the dog (75 lbs) to and front soccer, grocery store, and family road trips.So far i have al but positive experiences with the Q7."
car_3499,Q7: Power and Luxury is possisble!,"The Q7 TDI with the 8 speed automatic is a pleasure to drive. This is not your typical diesel found in US cars. The TDI is very quiet but really strong, the torque provides a very smooth acceleration and the 8 speed transmission shifts flawlessly.On a recent highway trip to Atlanta, Ga we locked the cruise in at 78 and were getting 26.6 MPG with 3 adults. The Audi MMI ( multi media interface that controls the nav, music and voice recognition works great. I really like the Goggle Earth Navigation.The MMI allows for up to 8 devices to be connected through WiFi.The seats are comfortable and 2 position seat memory works well for the needs of 2 different sized drivers."
car_3500,Nothing like it,"This big SUV has more power than you would realize.  Catches others on the road by surprise with its spunk.  The other eyeopener for me, having owned three Range Rovers, is the stares it receives.  You cannot miss it on the road."
car_3501,3 Year Look Back,"After almost 3 years, I love my 2003 G. I purchased this vehicle to drive daily, but also to be used on mountain trails, farm fields and much off roading. Great, great vehicle. It climbs a mountain like a goat and has terrific power and handling abilities. I had some problems along the way which required the replacement of it's computer, and some mechanical parts.  The best SUV out there that combines  off-road ability with great highway features."
car_3502,True 4 wheel power,An outstanding vehicle capable of any chosen offroad drive test. Unique power on the highway. Startup at trafic intersection to 75 mph within 6 seconds. It's extremely safe. I survived a head on colission with another vehicle in a previous model with out mishap.
car_3503,excellent,"I feel very secured,is a lot of

would like to keep this car for many

dependability. Have always owned MPPV,
this has great performance. I have not
experienced any excessive wind noise or
other negative points shared by editors
or reviewers.  Better than the Escalade
and the new Porshe toureag/cayen."
car_3505,Mercedes Benz G Wagon,"Great vehicle, after the dealer 
removes all of the door rattles.  For 
a hand made vehicle, Mercedes Benz 
needs to put effort in delivery of a 
rattle free vehicle, including wind 
noise.  The dealership took care of 
all issues.  Hopefully Mercedes Benz 
will take note of the money they are 
paying dealers to take care of factory 
issues.  The more miles it has the 
better it drives, i.e., loosens up."

car_3512,G500 EI Review,"This my third high-end SUV, and it is 
my best by far.  The unique styling is 
very eye catching.  All of the 
creature comforts offered in the G500 
are comparable to those of the S and 
CL classes.  The comfort seat makes 
long drives or sitting through 
protracted traffic jams a very 
comfortable experience. Couple the 
seats with the upgraded sound system 
and can almost shut out the rest of 
the world.  The all-terrain tires can 
offer a fairly stiff ride, but that 
can be remedied by replacing them with 
a softer, wider tire that is more 
suited for highway driving."

car_3514,Unsafe at any speed,"I had a problem with the so called 
safety features from day one- the ESP

the car and discover that there indeed 
was a defect in the system. By that 
time I wanted nothing to do with this

level underground parking garages).
A point to be made here is that you 
are buying this vehicle for what it 
is, A Mercedes Truck, not for anything

car_3534,2005 Grand Edition G55,"This is supposed to be a SUV, with excellent off road capabilities, by far probably the best, for vehicle on sale for civilian use. Any one expecting a ride quality and or comfort of a sedan, will be disappointed. I have about 125,000 miles on my vehicle, and can report an average of 13:5 MPG, compared to my previous Chevy Suburban which averaged about 14 MPG, over the same number of miles, one reason, the suburban used 87 octane gas and the G uses 91 octane so a more expensive vehicle to drive. Parts and or repairs are comparable, or have been to me. Probably depends on one's driving habits. It's the same design since 1979. People who like it love it, for other it grows on one. One thing in a situation where it's to be valet parked, they park it up front and center.People actually come and want to discuss the vehicle in parking lots, so because of its rarity, it certainly turns heads. It came with Yokohama AVS 18"" tires, apparently it's not been made any more, it was a very comfortable quite tire, I would like opinions on replacement.The G55 looks as good as new, I ave changed the rear lights to LED, and the fronts to BiXenon, I have also upgraded to a sattelite based GPS audio unit., the result, the controls on the steering wheel does not work.The heated steering wheel, and heated seats for the passenger in the front and two in the back will bless you on chilly days. The vault like doors give a level of safety, unlike any other. It is known to jar the electric window regulators and make them malfunction I have read elsewhere, I have been spared so far , though the rear right has started to show some sluggishness supposed to be a $400+ fix."
car_3535,2005 - G500 Grand Edition,"This car is bulletproof. Rides like a luxury sedan. Handles like a beast in the snow and bad weather. Mine is at 190+k miles and going strong and looks great! Wish it had navigation, blue tooth and a usb port. Things starting to go wrong and it's  $500- $1,000 each time. All 4 door lock malfunction - one goes the others go at $300 each, Windshield wiper motor, worn out belts...pitted window is common here in the mountains, etc. Oh, did I tell you that if your headlamp goes out you just don't replace at $10, you have to take apart the front end and that can be $400+. But here's the bottom line...I walk out, jump in and it starts and goes and goes and goes."
car_3536,Military vehicle,"Having seen the G-Wagon in the miltary service, it is kind of odd to see them as a luxury car. These tanks are made to take all kind of abuses. Unless you are taking them off-road in the Pac West or somewhere, you will be better off driving a smaller SUV."
car_3537,G Class Rules,I have had my G for quite some time.  It is quality throughout.  No plastic and thin metal.   Go and drive the best.  It's better than my BMW 5 series and the best vehicle I have ever driven.  See for yourself.  The Hummer owners wish they had one!  Its for real.
car_3538,Porsche to G wagon,"Robust is not the word to describe this. Steel frame, heavy steel, massive hinges. You'd think it was built for military use. It turns heads everywhere.  I've been wanting one for 2 years, and am not in any way disapointed, except I wish service could be thru MB trucks and not the car dealer."
car_3539,Canadian Military's Finest,Our second G. My wife wanted one of the last ones to make it to North America. She loves it and places me second place in our home. Great ride and commands the road. The new 2006 being built in Alabama does not deserve the G CLASS name!! It is an embarassment to us G lovers!! (maybe Pacifica 2 would be more appropriate!)
car_3540,Mercedes Saved The Best For The Last,With a 469hp twin turbo V8 Kompressor engine this vehicle has prodigious power.  The dual side exhaust sounds incredible.  This beast will do zero to sixty in a little under 5.5 seconds which makes it the ultimate sleeper until they hear the substantial roar of the exhaust rattle their ear drums.  However when the windows are up you can barely hear it.  This is a tight vehicle to say the least.  Mercedes teased us all by putting the V8 Kompressor in the last model year for the G - (or is it? - I have heard rumors of possibly continuing the G series under a different manufacturer)
car_3541,G-Wagon,"This truck can go anywhere and through anything. It can also tow my 32 foot boat without a thought. I also like the fact that it is solid and NOT made of plastic. It is made to go 1,000,000 miles."
car_3542,shaspa,Such a solid drive.  Extremely comfortable.  The quality of the vehicle is so amazing.  We feel much safer with this heavy vehicle.
car_3543,End of the world car,"Plenty of power, off road prowess in a

car_3544,Great car,"Why go with some lower middle class

NOTHING CAN COMPARE TO THIS SUPERB 
VEHICLE."
car_3548,Update to previous review,"I've had this vehicle now for 5 months. It has been in the shop several times. It is not reliable and I cannot recommend it. The steering wheel shock absorber was replaced and front end was aligned, the entire headlight bulb assembly had to be reworked to fix an electrical short (this took 3 trips to the dealer) and the passenger side door had to be realigned since it would not close properly. This was all within the 1st. week of ownership. Then the rear door lock went and now the rear window washer does not work. Car is a time bomb. The dealer is now offering to buy it back after my complaints. It was supposed to be CPO'd, but problems since day 1 have been occurring."
car_3549,It owns the road,"in 07' the G was upgraded with xenon's and a 7 speed transmission. It looks like a huge car, but it's actually smaller than full size suv's like the Expedition, Navigator and Escalade. It is quite tall though. You either like the look or you don't. Inside, the interior is top notch. The controls are easy to operate, but the car needs steering wheel mounted volume controls. You have to reach over a ways to get to the radio. Plenty of foot room, lots of cargo room. Get moving and the doors lock with the sound of a 12 guage cocking, the car turns very tight, handles well at low speeds, on the highway it loves rough roads. It doesn't handle too well on turns at speed, it's a huge tall SUV after all"
car_3550,G55 is a solid luxury SUV,"I bought this G55 for my wife. While it is not a typical squshy SUV,it is everything else and more. The power is amazing, Motor trend shows it at 0- 60MPH in 4.7 seconds agianst the cayanne S, bmx x series.It is very well built, handles very well and I feel safe with my wife and 3 children driving in it daily. The interior has superior finishes. The rear seats are great with 3 dedicated true seats, logs of leg room and a tall roof make it spacious. The trunk is very deep and easy to put strollers and groceries into. As the car breaks in, it is getting quicker in performance. I would buy it again in a minute. Once you drive it, you won't drive any other suv. No problems thus far at all."
car_3551,"A Beautiful Tank on the outside, Harsh on the inside","My wife got this car as her ultimate SUV dream vehicle.She had wanted one for 15 years.We got a good deal and she traded in her Lexus LX 570.We went from a peaceful cocoon of luxury to a rough and randy tank.She absolutely loves it.There is truly nothing else like it on the road.However, it is not very comfortable to drive.Steering is heavy.Acceleration is slow.The engine is loud.The seats are not comfortable.And yet everytime she looks at it, she loves it a little more.I don't like driving it at all, but that's why she tells me its her car, not mine."
car_3552,Overrated car,"It's a fun car, I would not think of buying another though. I truly think its overrated. For an SUV it's too fancy, but it has great on road handling."
car_3553,2009 G-CLASS,I bought the new G because i was tired of all the 09 vehicles looking alike. well the G is all I hoped it would be as well as fun to own and drive. its not for everyone but its the ideal vehicle for me. THE ONLY NEGATIVE- IT GETS TOO MUCH ATTENTION.
car_3554,Good SUV,"This car is excellent off road, tackling anything that it comes upon. Roomy in all the areas except front legroom. Buttons aren't that logically laid out either."
car_3555,Solid. Over-engineered and an investment,This thing doesn't drive great and gets poor gas mileage.  But you know that.... It sounds tough with the dual exhaust under the running boards.  It's completely impractical unless you are driving in the Arctic or Sub-saharan Africa  but emotionally feels great and should last a lot longer than you do. This is the car you can pass down and remember how they made real cars that a human had to operate!

car_3557,My Third G-Wagon,"I took delivery of my G65 AMG on July 24, 2016. This is my third G-Wagon over the course of seven years. I continue to come back to this vehicle because there simply is nothing like it, this vehicle has zero competition. For that reason, I will tell you exactly what I like and dislike about my G65. The first thing that I like would have to be it's styling. I have a wrapped matte black G65 and with the LED Daytime Running lamps, I just can't get enough. The doors sound like you are shutting a tank, it's quite the experience. The interior is absolutely resembling a true luxury Mercedes-Benz. I personally have the Piano Black trim and it looks stunning on the steering wheel, the doors, and across the dash. My Designo seats are amazingly comfortable and I would have no problem driving for hours on end. The space is immense, and with two kids in middle school, that's a must. Overall, I would recommend any trim level of the G-Wagon, you are getting a great value."
car_3558,infamous G wagon,Looks great. Very macho vehicle. Driving was a different story. Steering was numb. Ergonomics were dated. Uncomfortable seating position for long trips.
car_3559,Awesome Power and Looks,"Amazing performance, sound, and looks.  Not the mileage or rear seat room for a family touring vehicle but excellent around town runner.  Front driver and passenger room and comfort is excellent.  This SUV is like no other and draws a lot of attention wherever you drive it."

car_3561,2017 G550 Nightmare,"I have slaved through school for the past 14 years to finally purchase the car of my dreams. I spent countless hours test driving and convincing my wife to buy this car. It was a special order designed by the dealer. It just so happened to be the exact color and some options I preferred. I made a down payment. En route to the US from germany, the cargo ship had a fire. This caused a +1 month hold up on my car at the port of Baltimore. Thinking to myself????? ""Should I buy a car like this?""  The car was released and finally arrives!!! Yes!  I go to the dealer for pickup and drive it for 15 minutes and enjoyed finally being able to see the most beautiful hand crafted piece of artwork ever made. I cruised at low speeds, talked to my salesman, played the radio. Of course, no one is paging attention to fine details at this point. The car went straight from the dealer to my friend who has placed Xpel ultimate on other vehicles of mine. He did an amazing job. 1 week worth of hard work and dedication, The day finally arrives to return the loaner and pick up my car. From the start I heard an intermittent ""booting"" noise, almost like a baby owl. It would mainly occur between shifts or let up off of the gas. Higher temperatures outside produced a more defined and constant noise. The biggest issue besides the ""most"" annoying noise was a very hard rumbly and shaking shift when I would brake from 4th to 3rd gear. This was always constant. I finally got the car to my local detailed (whom has been more than professional and kind) to have the service manager drive my car. He noted all of the complaints and the car went in for service. Adaptations (computer updates) were performed which actually made the shifting and hard shakes worse. This is week 3 and there has been no fix. I was told today that, corporate engineers, told my local service team to tear apart the transmission and check everything. They respectfully disagreed and deferred this treatment. They know it's a transmission issue and a case was opened. Meanwhile, they have captured the noise and recorded what I described as ""hooting"" earlier. They hear it and also agree that this is ""NOT"" normal. They have no idea what is causing it. With this, I was told today that the service team have been in contact with corporate and they have planned to order a new transmission...... from Germany. 2 more weeks, plus delivery, plus installation. I have involved and contacted MB customer service.  These messages have been relayed up the hierachal chain. They were great about getting back to me in a very efficient time. I was told today that they assure their engineers are trying to fix this problem quickly. I have assured and assured that no one in their right mind would pay 129k for a car and want the transmission replaced and to have a noise that can't be fixed. Without anymore complaining and painful details, I am still dealing with this and to let others know, I am not the only one with these issues. A new ""befriended"" friend of mine and I have been in contact, and he has the same noises. He has also had his brand new 2017 G550 rear end replaced because they thought the noise was coming from there. It's been a disaster and no one who pays this sort of money on a high end luxury vehicle deserves this. The car should be taken back without any question."
car_3562,15 year review,"Drives like a very heavy and strongly build military vehicle.  The weight is easily noticed.  Appearance of the car has not aged.  Excellent paint, hinges with no rust, under carriage with no structural rust.  Garage kept but mainly used during inclement winter weather on the salt soaked roads of the Notheast.  Gobbles gas.  Acceleration is impressive for a car with this weight.   It has had glitchy electrical problem that the dealership has not been able to identify.  Not a comfortable drive.  Tight suspension as expected for an off road design."
car_3563,hot,hot
car_3564,LOVE LOVE LOVE OUR G,"We love our G-wagen. They stay classic and hold their value like no other vehicle. Our 2002 looks almost exactly like the brand new ones. It drives fantastic and our mechanical costs have been quite minimal considering it has over 170,000 miles. Please, repairs for this vehicle are pretty straight forward and therefore labor costs stay low. We love the heated rear seats and the huge cargo area. We couldn't ask for a safer vehicle for our family. We get so many compliments every time we drive it and people are constantly asking us if they can look at the inside. We plan on keeping our G500 forever and just fixing it as we need to. There's not another car out there that we like better. There are several G-wagen owner websites and they all say the same thing- these are the coolest and best SUVs out there and are timeless classics!"
car_3565,Amazing,"I've owned my 2002 for 7 years.  It's been amazing.  It's a truck.  Drives like a truck. It is not an Escalade or some floaty phony SUV.  That's why i love it.  After a massive blizzard a few years ago (nearly 5ft of snow), my father was stuck on the side of road about 45 miles from my home.  Trapped in his car with no way of getting assistance (the cops and fire couldn't respond) I drove out to get him.  I made fresh tracks on Interstate 95 and numerous side roads the whole way.  Never even had to lock the diffs.  The truck performed amazingly.  It was unreal.  100+ miles in 3-5ft of snow the whole way and the thing didn't bat an eye.Also didn't even have to shovel myself out."
car_3566,A Tank,"No Question, this vehicle is not for everybody. It's rough, strong, and at the same time a beautiful piece of art. Even though MPG is very low that doesn't keep me from driving it daily."
car_3567,Best car on the road,"Every since the late 80's when I first saw the car at a friends house (european version) I new this is a car I had to have. not wanting to pay the $130,000 that it cost then I waited till MB put it out themselves and have not been disapointed. No other car can hold a candle to the styling and off road performance of this monster. They havent had to change it since the 70's (something must be right)"
car_3568,Great truck - Bad service,"Great looking, safe, comfortable and fun. Goes anywhere on or off road and feels solid in any weather conditions. Lots of cargo room and I have moved lots of small furniture in back with seats folded down.  PROBLEM: Dealers have little experience or knowledge of how to service this vehicle. Many small issues have had to be fixed three or more times, also bodywork is a nightmare if you get in an accident. Mercedes does not have its act together in training its staff and service techs."
car_3569,I love my car!,The G-Wagen is so eyecatching on the exterior and it is the kind of car that you feel so good to be in. Wherever you go a lot of attention is on you. It's fast for an SUV and the brakes are great because you can stop at the last minute.
car_3570,Rolls Royce of 4x4s,"It is the best truck on the road. It simply looks like nothing else, and drives like caviar on butter. I had to limo-tint my windows as this car definitely gets a lot of attention. Every time I drive someone in the G500 they WOW all the time. When I go to clubs or restaurants, valet parking would always put it up front for grabbing attention. This is a top of the line truck."
car_3571,What A Mess,This car rocks....when it works. My G wagon was in the shop 32 days in 8 months for a never ending run of problems which the dealer could not fix so I switched dealers...three times with the same results. Drive out of the shop and some light or warning would go off before I got home. The only possible way you drive this car is if you have another one when this one is in the shop.
car_3572,Let's Be Objective,"I knew what I was buying before I bought it.  This vehicle does get terrible gas mileage, compared to a Civic, but you should expect it when you are buying an almost 3 ton truck that costs $80,000.  It is stiff, but you have to consider what this truck was originally desinged for.  I had to take it to the dealer to have a few minor things fixed, but what vehicle does not have problems every now and then.  The verdict is this:  If you want a vehicle that will never go out of style, that will take you virtually anywhere, a vehicle that has plenty of power and eye appeal, then you should buy one!  If you are thinking why would I need a truck to be all that..I don't know...WHY NOT!!!"
car_3573,OH MY HECK!!!!!,"This is no SUV for the typical 
affluent housewife.  It is an awesome 
military born rugged SUV turned luxury-
--well, as much as possible.  It takes 
a heavy hand and a heavy foot, but 
that is not a bad thing.  It is more 
of a man's car, no doubt.  I love it 
because it is never going to lose the 
visual appeal it possesses.  It is 
strong, demanding, and has incredible 
presence.  That is what makes the G500 
stand all alone.  Nothing comes 
close."
car_3574,It's a truck - not a luxury SUV,"I bought this vehicle in spite of your 
review.  I wanted a stiff rding, 
ruggedly built, durable vehicle with a 
military heritage.  You may nit-pick, 
but it's still an S-class interior.  It can't 
go out of style because it never was 
in style.  It will out climb an H-1 and 
do 130 on the road.  Try that with any 
other SUV on the market.  Yeah, you'll 
be laughing in years to come, but it 
will be at yourselves for identifying 
this thing as a luxury SUV."
car_3575,GREAT G500,"AWSOME GO ANYWHERE DO ALL VEHICLE, BEST 
4 WHEEL DRIVE OF THEM ALL!!!!!!!!"
car_3576,the last industrial grade vehicle,"In a world of ""me too"" styling, with emphasis 
on gadgets and gizmos this truck stands 
alone.  It is a handbuilt industrial strength 
machine intended for those who understand 
how to use its' capabilities - soccer moms 
need not apply.  Unfortunately, the pit bull 
looks do tend to attract a certain 'gangsta' 
element to this truck - they want to talk to you 
at stop lights and find out how much it cost.  
Fortunately, that big motor allows you to 
blow them away when the light turns green."
car_3577,Not what I expected.,"I've owned 2 Lexus LX 470's, upon 
purchasing the G 500 I realized just 
how  much I'd given up. The interior 
is much narrower than the LX, the ride 
is much firmer and the cabin is much 
darker (due to the lack of a glass 
sunroof). All of this is immediatly 
apparent when you first test drive the 
G, but its initial seductiveness makes 
you put all of this aside. 
Unfortunatly the sexiness wears off 
very quickly and all your left with 
are the shortcomings. As soon as DMV 
processes my title, I'll probably sell 
the G and look at either the 2003 
Range Rover or another LX 470."
car_3578,THE RIGHT STUFF,This is the best SUV I have ever bee in
car_3579,Heavy Duty Fagility,"The G500 is a great eye catcher and off-
road performer.  The materials and and 
weight are reminiscent of the Mercedes 
of yesteryear. When you close the 
door... it CLOSES.  All the major 
problems come from the advanced 
electronic systems.  Seems as though 
Mercedes rushed it into production 
before bringing it to the States. It'll 
be better in 2003 or 2004, hopefully."
car_3580,THIS IS A TRUCK,"You can't criticize a good off road 
vehicle for being a good off road 
vehicle. If you bought it just for the 
looks or for the trendiness you will 
probably will get tired of it. But if 
you appreciate the confidence of being 
able to face whatever the weather 
report throws at you (even if you never 
ever go off road), you will not get rid 
of this warranty on life. Plenty of 
power. Just a bit rough on the potholes 
(you are not supposed to drive 80 mph 
off road)..."
car_3581,G500 is TOPS,"I've owned several Mercedes Benz but by 
far this is the Best one yet.We needed 
a truck for our family the ML is to 
small for a family truck so when I saw 
a G500 up close I bought it."
car_3582,G-Wagen So FLY!!!,The G500 is the coolest SUV Ever
car_3583,G wagen is best,"This is the greatest suv ever..and I've 
owned alot.  Blows away all the 
competition and is more off road 
friendly than any others, yet drives in 
the city like the big MB sedans.  Buy 
one!"
car_3584,Not All That,"I admit, I had to order one and be one 
of the first. Yes I made a mistake and 
will be selling or trading it in. While 
it's a respectable off road vehicle and 
can run circles around anything except 
a Hummer (either one) but it's just 
too ""goofy"" to be seen in every day. 
Face it, call it retro, art, or just 
plain ugly it's not a good looking 
vehicle. Interior quality is Mercedes 
all the way. Not sure who this truck is 
targeted toward, but it's not me."
car_3585,Big Mistake,"Built like a tank. Awesome styling. 
Feel great driving it."
car_3586,perfect,best suv in the world
car_3587,G-Wagon,"The G-Wagon is a superb all around 
vehicle. It is comfortable on the 
highway yet tough and powerful off 
road.It is an absolute joy to drive. 
The biggest drawback is fighting my 
wife over who gets to drive it (she has 
an Escalade)."
car_3588,Ignore Bad Reivews - They don't own this,"This is one of the greatest cars ever.  
It's so fun to drive, both because it's 
a great machine and because it turns 
heads.  I have a 1993 version that I 
bought in Europe as well as a 2002.  
The '93 is as good as the day I bought 
it. I'm sure I'll drive them both 
forever."

Purchesed.  Buy IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
car_3594,what a mistake,never again
car_3595,Well worth the wait...!,"Well worth the wait..!! Nothing quite like it. It is a truck, and don't forget that! It was'nt just designed, and made retro. It is work of art, in progress, and it only gets better with age. I use it as a daily driver and can't say enough. It is truly what I expected and more. Waited 11 months and the ""G"" has not disappointed, both mechanically or in terms of drivability. If you are really honest with yourself as to what you are buying you will not be disappointed. Happy motoring..!!/4x4ing."
car_3596,UGLY,nice inside bad outside
car_3597,I'll keep itfor 20 years!,"After about 2,500 miles, the G500 is perfect: comfortable, extreemly capeable off road, built like a tank and civilized enough that I have to fight my wife for the keys.  On road performance is adequate in all respects with acceleration good, braking very good and handling, surprisingly, also very good.  Moreover, it has remarkably good NVH isolation.  The COMAND system is complicated, but I like having access to a GPS."
car_3598,The Best,"A G-Class ( Gelaendewagen) is simply the best SUV there is. Forget the Hummer, Range\Land Rover, Land Cruiser etc. This vehicle will get you out of anything. Ask the US military why they are switching from the Hummer to the G-class..."
car_3599,excellent vehicle,this is the best car ever. period.
car_3600,Bullet proof,I like this truck in every way.
car_3601,Do it if you can!,Do it if you can!
car_3602,Still good Car !!!!,"Inside space is small , running noise !"
car_3603,Fun car to drive,"Car seats are tricky in the rear seat. This is a fun car to drive but definately not a family car. It’s fun for my husband and I but when we take our grandchild, it feels cramped."
car_3604,Fun to drive w/ great gas mileage!,"I've owned this car for 3 months and put close to 5k miles on it and I love it.  If you want a car that is fun to drive, gets great mileage, and has a surprising amount of storage this car is for you."
car_3605,Beautiful car with liability issue,"I'm not going write a long detail about this car but to the point. Bought the car used with 12k, beautiful inside and out, own the car for 6 months, went to dealer 3 times to get fixed. Yes, under warranty but VERY INCONVENIENCE to me, had 2010 RX 350 previously, never went to the dealership in 3 years. I sold MB last week and back to Lexus RX . MB did everything right but LIABILITY. Update: As asked by Edmunds. Resale value isn't good for MB. very happy with rx350, becuz I don't have to worry about what random thing will need fixing this month or next."
car_3606,Eye candy - but rough ride,"Pros: sporty style, very comfortable front seats, fantastic engine power/acceleration, easy set cruise control, above average fuel economy.  Cons: terrible road noise, very bumpy ride almost to the point that you feel no shock cushioning, poor weather stripping allows excessive amount of rain/moisture/dirt around interior door casing (bring towels to the car wash), awkward door lock handle interferes with elbow room, small window makes reaching ATM and drive thru difficult without hitting your head, very expensive run flat tires, uncomfortable rear seats.  This is my first MB and I expected much more of a smooth and quiet ride."
car_3607,mothers day gift,purchased 2015 white pre owned mercedes gla250 with 8000 miles. loved the look of this car received many compliments and looked forward to driving it every day.it has a considerable amount of road noise and does not have the keyless entry which are annoying. All was well until I hit a pot hole in feb 2017 and another in the same spot one month later which cost me 2 new tires. because of the pot hole accidents and needing a new alignment i was pretty cool about the whole thing.  What caused me to be Very Upset was when they went to do the alignment they found a whole bunch of other problems including a right rear rod and right rear tire etc. the cost of these repairs will be about $2500 on the conservative side nothing covered by the warranty. now I thought I had bought a relatively new car as it was certified with only 8000 miles.It seems to me that this much damage to this Mercedes is abnormal Could the car be so flimsy as to incur so much damage from going over a couple of pot holes. I am sad and so disappointed and have lost my confidence in the Mercedes brand. i have driven many  other cars and run into pot holes without this much damage. I will probably sell this car and get a more sturdy vehicle. I welcome any feedback from this revies
car_3608,Electronics are ridiculous!,"I have had the car for 9 months on a lease.  The car has  been in the shop a whopping 4 times for the same problem  - the keyless go.  I have had issues with the car trunk opening without unlocking the car, the blue tooth sounds a little grainy I'm told, the door unlock from the handle works intermittently and then just recently had a bizarre message about security on my radio and that I had to call customer service to get it unlocked!  I was also told not to put my key in the  console as that messes with the electronics.  Are you kidding me?!"
car_3609,Very Satisfied,"We have had the car about 9 months and a couple things stand out. First, it takes some getting used to when driving in that it seems bigger than it is. This is due to the high hood line. It also has some challenging blind spots which require an extra level of attention. However once you get used to it, all is fine. The ride is good. Perhaps the transmission is a bit sluggish particularly if you are just lazying around, and the ride a bit hard, but again once you get used to it. I expect German cars to feel the road more than mushy Japanese SUVs. When compared to the Lexus NX, I would say the NX is a luxury ute and the GLA more a sport ute. Interior wise it is small, slightly smaller than my old Audi A3 hatchback. So if you are planning to carry a bunch of stuff/passengers, not the car.  What is most interesting however, are the regular looks and comments we get. OK, our car is bright red so it attracts a bit of attention but strangers regularly comment on how nice it looks. Not just the color, but the whole package. I particularly like the looks of rear end. Even 9 months later I still think it is a nice looking car when compared to other SUVs. Would I buy it again:  If the Macan got better gas mileage I might answer that differently, but until then, Yes without a doubt."
car_3610,Fast pricey,It's fast in a straight line not to shabby in the corners. Very very small. I really want to get it out on the track I'll update then
car_3611,"Best vehicle I've owned, hands down!","Pros:Best drive quality in it's class, sporty and sit up higherGreat visibilityVery safe- standard safety features are fantastic top rated in its class in Europe by farEco, Sport, Manual, and Off-road modes are alot of fun (especially sport and manual, lots of pep)MPG is very respectableCan get fully loaded for a reasonable price compared to other Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are fully loadedBi-Xenon headlights are fantastic, really sharp daytime running LED stripsCons:Lumbar support for front seats is limited to lower and mid backBack Seats have limited head roomSome of the materials on the interior feel cheaper compared to a c class (which is to be expected)No option for air conditioned seatsNo remote start (may just be my model I bought)So I was sold on the 2015 c 300, I loved it- the drive quality the refined interior, love at first sight!  However, after driving the GLA250 it stole my heart.  While the c300 had a more refined ride (smoother) and the acceleration was slightly better, the drive of the GLA250 was equally impressive plus it provides much better visibility and you just feel safer sitting up higher in the vehicle.  While the c-class has minor upgrades (automatic headrest, heated windshield washer fluid, a few more soft touch surfaces) the GLA250 felt like a 'younger' car.  Being 29 years old the styling of the GLA250 seemed to fit me better- a bit more modern, sleek, and it still has the same s class styles that are great in the c-class.  It also feels like the GLA250 just has some more space as well.  The mpg is also very impressive and I have had 0 issues with the car thus far.I also got an unbelievable deal on my 2015 GLA250 4matic certified pre owned and paid $33,000- includes Bi-xenon headlights, navigation/back-up camera, panoramic moonroof, 19"" AMG rims and sport AMG styling, climate control etc original MSRP was almost $44K!  I then paid an extra $2750 to take my CPO warranty to the next level:bumper to bumper up to 50K miles or 5 years, whichever comes firstplus 3 years of unlimited miles bumper to bumper coverage and $0 deductible!I drive 50K miles per year for work and was told with confidence by MB that as long as the car remains within the warranty period they will always repair the car with no deductible; EVEN IF THE COST OF THE REPAIR EXCEEDS THE VEHICLES VALUE!  So I can finish my loan out with 300K miles and have had $30K+ in repairs (not maintenance, that is obviously not covered) and would pay absolutely nothing and they would honor the agreement.  Apparently, customers who drive this much are considered a 'bump on the chin' they are willing to take considering how few are able to take full advantage of the warranty.  Easily the best warranty in America at the moment.Very happy and impressed with my 'new' CPO Benz!!!"
car_3612,Performance Multi-tasker,"I just finished the 1000 mile break-in period by doing a road trip and business meeting. So, I have limited mileage. However, I have found the car to be everything I wanted. I wanted a multitask vehicle to carry kayaks and ski's, do track time, carry the groceries and function in snowy mountains and hot summers where I live. This is a tall order and usually you would have at least two different vehicles. So let me list the best things first. 1. Style. I get lots of comments by people from car washes to parking lots who've never seen ""one of these"". I have the spoiler on my car which helps differentiate it and yells ""performance car"" as opposed to the normal hatch/SUV GLA. 2. Interior. It is sport and luxury. I have the red cut leather which covers the dash and gives you a lot of red highlights inside, even on the air vents. Everyone loves it. 3. Comfort. the sport seats are comfortable and I have taken five people in the car to dinner and back seats are fantastic, especially for this size car. I did about 1400 miles on the road trip, as much as ten hours in one day with no problem. Absolutely amazing seats. I expect they will be fine when I track the car, too. 4. Space. It's not a huge SUV but plenty of space in the back and passenger space. You have a pass through and a roof rack if you need to carry large stuff from Home Depot or kayaks, in my case. 5. Ride. The most amazing balanced ride. It is sporty but absorbs the small bumps well. I got the 19in tires. I have the optional damper system, as well and only used it once, but it is amazing. Will use it on track. 6. All things engine. Acceleration, sport settings and the main reason you get an AMG. I have not done the launch mode, yet. Sport setting is the way to go. Negatives: 1. Electronic system is complicated. I got my phone synched but still not for music, voicemail and even phone nav. Screwing around with buttons while driving is annoying. On the other hand, most the basic stuff like volume and drive systems are separate buttons. 2. Not really set up with phone holders or much for electronics like in the rear. Your phone will be in cup holder or ash tray. 3. Side mirrors do not flare out easily for the 180 degree field of view. Most sport drivers do this. You can get it at the very limit of the side mirrors but it buries the mirror in the housing and sort of tricks your eye to thinking there may be a car in the blind spot unless you look carefully. That is about it for now. I rated reliability as just good because no new car issues but I have not had it long enough to really make an accurate rating on that."
car_3613,A Zippy Little Dream Car,"The only real downside to this car is that it is small. If you're looking for a big SUV or one with lots of interior space, this is not your vehicle. If you're looking for a car that can carry a little extra but is super fun to drive, this is your car. For the first few months of owning the car, I would look for excuses to go drive it. After more than a year of owning this car, I still look forward to getting behind the wheel. I purchased the premium package; I love the sound system too. Nothing like flying down the road with my favorite music sounding like I'm in a concert hall.The official review said that it was bumpy off the start. I haven't noticed that. I like the Sport mode that makes for more aggressive shifting. Great when speeding through curvy mountain roads. I've owned the Infiniti FX, Infiniti QX50 and Honda Crosstour (with V6). The GLA isn't as powerful as those cars but it gets better gas milage and the steering/handling is head and shoulders above the others."
car_3614,Search to replace anot RX400h,"My wife wants smaller, better gas mileage, high seating, luxury, and sporty. The only option is the GLA. The 250 was nice, but the 45 extracts a big grin. A perfect car for empty nesters who are young at heart. The professional (writers) reviewers don't seem to able to define this car. It really is in its own classification. Google ""GLA 45 videos"" to get a true feel for what this car is!"
car_3615,Want to drive it all day!!,"I have had my GLA for two months now and like it more and more each day.  It's a little quirky to get used to driving at low speeds.  But once you get a feel for it, the experience is very good.  It's truly an enjoyable car to drive.  Find myself thinking of excuses to go places just for the chance to drive it.   Drove my GLA in one of the worst snow storms I have been in and it handled perfectly.   This was due to the all wheel drive and great overall feel of the road you get from the steering.  My first bens and won't be my last!"
car_3616,My first Benz!  I love it!!!,"The Eco drive takes a little getting used to.  I wish it had an option to turn it off completely.  It resumes every time the vehicle is started.  A little frustrating when in stop and go city traffic.  Other than that, I love this vehicle.  The areas that I find a little fault with are very much compensated by the quality of the vehicle overall.  I would purchase this car over and over again.  I looked at and drove many different vehicles before making this purchase.  I have zero regrets!!"
car_3617,Review,Excellent Automobile !
car_3618,Love the GLA,"My wife and I love the GLA. We narrowed our search between the GLA, BMW X1 and the Audi Q3. In my opinion all three cars rode very well, and we almost purchased the X1, until we saw the GLA. The GLA's interior and exterior far exceeded the out of date X1. The GLA is fun to drive, has plenty of power, mpg is good, it sits high and is very comfortable and is reportedly very safe."
car_3619,Love it!,"Make sure you know what package you want and what features/upgrades are included. (Mine came with one that had a weird combo of things like leather with no heated/vented seats, no satilite radio, no rain sensing windshield, but other nicely upgraded features...) It's the little conveniences that are missing that irk me, but I love the car and that's what it comes down to."
car_3620,What could be better!,"Very nice car. Attractive look. People told me a number of times "" what is nice car"". You rarely hear for average car. Back seat is good enough. I have two kids (9 and 4) and checked car seat first. Fits nicely. Cargo is ok. Mileage is outstanding (26.8 after 1 year - 9000 miles, mostly city). Highway - around 32 mpg. My only disappointment was you cannot switch permanently from eco to sport mode etc. Eco is defolt and you need to switch it every time if you would like to do it (finally I was lazy enough to do it and currently drive in eco mode). No complains."
car_3621,Not thrilled,"Generally, this car is just basic. Nothing too exciting. The ECO drive feature is dangerous and unusable in the city. It frequently just revs when the accelerator is depressed in the ECO mode, until suddenly the accelerator kicks in. I have narrowly missed being in several accidents and no longer use ECO ever. In general the car does not have much punch, accelerates slowly. We previously had a BMW 550, I know- apples and oranges, still it's disappointing. Finally, the headrests on the front seats are poorly designed. I am 5'4"", an average height for women, and the headrest is too high in its lowest setting. I have developed chronic neck pain from these seats.It is easy to park in the city, especially with the rear cameras. I do wish it had keyless entry for safety reasons. And it's cliche but there really is nowhere to put a purse. The console between the front seats has the dial to control the functions panel and it frequently gets bumped by my purse, arm etc. suddenly changing functions such as radio station etc."
car_3622,1K mile review,"250 4 matic sport package.Pros: great looking car, fun to drive, good mpg's, stylish interior, 4 year warranty w/ roadside assistance included, safety features, coldest air conditioning I have ever felt and lastly with awd option it goes through any weather condition in style ; )Cons: price with all the options, back seat leg room for taller passengers and suspension is a little stiff on bumpy roads.Overall I'm very pleased with my GLA."
car_3623,Pull the trigger,"My wife and I  looked at a lot of suv's and cars before buying our gla. It wasn't the cheapest or the most spacious but what it's defidtly not, is the same boring car or gas guzzling monster suv you see everywhere . It's a head turner and it shares the same heritage as the most exspensive Mercedes.  If you listen to all the rhetoric from every critic on the net you'll never feel secure buying anything. You won't be disappointed if you buy one."
car_3624,Front CV joint problem,"I bought this GLA 250 4 Matic on September14th  2015 . It was my dream to own a mercedez , but unfortunately the next day after delivery of this vehicle I found noice in the front axil while I turn the vehicle to left or right side.I took the vehicle back to the seller and they found that the front axil is defective. They ordered for replacement , But I don't know how long will it take to get them here.My question is how could the one of top rated mercedez cold deliver such defective vehicles out of factory! I am really disappointed. So my advise to new buyers of this vehicle is that , please double check the axil before you take the delivery of this vehicle otherwise you may not notice the problem until the the warranty is over. I didn't even drive 200 km after purchase. I live in British virgin Islands, Carribbean.Update: After 3 months they replaced the CV joint, but still giving the same problem, took back the car to the service , they ordered anot her set, 4 months now, still no word from the company, waiting patiently for the part to arrive.Very much disappointed."
car_3625,AMG Rocks This Car,"Lots of the criticism of this car is ride quality.  That's like criticizing a Porsche Boxster because it doesn't ride as smoothly as a VW Jetta.  This car in the GLA-45 incarnation is a small beast.  We got the performance exhaust, which I would highly recommend to anyone who wants the sound of snap crackle and pop when decelerating or starting up.  The sound is just entertaining and roguish.  The car's handling is just about perfect.  The paddle shifters give you the control to make driving the car unbelievably fun.On one occasion we took it in for a precautionary visit at the dealer and we were introduced to Mercedes service, which in our experience was a cut above that of other premium cars we had owned (Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Cadillac).The car's aesthetics are eye-catching and we get lots of comments on the sporty look of the GLA-45.The interior is well thought-out and comfortable.  The Recaro seats provide a tight yet very adjustable sports seating experience.We had the Porsche Macan on the short list, but it is SO MUCH MORE expensive (even without the turbo option) and we've never regretted the decision to go GLA.The only downside we've noticed, and you'll read it in all the reviews is a lag in initial takeoff acceleration.  It's certainly not there in any other gears.  Shifting and acceleration are wonderful in all situations except the one you'll experience from zero to 10 MPH.  It's like a turbo lag... but that's not what it is.  We're hoping that a firmware upgrade in the car's computer will be available in the future, since this is obviously a logic issue.  If you're not drag racing, it won't bother you.  The car reviews wonderfully, because even though all reviewers mention this lag, what happens once the lag has passed is pure driving pleasure."
car_3626,A well thought out SUV that has a unique design,It's a head turner
car_3627,GLA250 4Matic - Great Little Crossover,"I've had the car for 18 months, and overall have been happy with it. It get's great mileage, and the drive quality is quite good. Slightly more road and wind noise when compared to other MB models. Interior quality is excellent, instrument layout is very good, except the navigation screen seems somewhat out of place. Ample cargo space, especially with rear seats folded. Since this is a new model, MB has some perfecting to do. What I find surprising is that since its introduction to the North American market, this particular model hasn't really taken off, I rarely see any in California. My sense is that MB may discontinue this model, similar to the discontinued GLK model. New GLC & GLE models are hitting the MB dealerships and have certainly peaked interests of new buyers. In the mean time, I continue to enjoy my GLA250 4Matic and its reliability, as well as the many compliments I have received from onlookers."
car_3628,its a beauty and quite a great price,"I got the sea blue and boy does it turn heads. Its my first automatic in years, which is a bit of a bummer because off the starting line it can be less than exciting. The Sport mode changes everything quickly- i love it. Gas mileage on highways is superb, gas mileage through the town is just ok. I really like the car a lot, and I adore it's looks. I wish the nav didn't misunderstand every single thing I say- it makes it easy less convenient than just talking to Siri on my iPhone through bluetooth. I wouldn't pay for that next time. Back seat isn't perfect, but you don't buy a car this size hoping for a giant backseat. I really find myself paddle shifting more than I expected, and I really like the sunroof and stereo quality. The climate is almost too cold. Great color. My first Benz and I significantly like it more than my husbands new c250 coupe."
car_3629,One week in but I love it.,"I just got the car after procrastinating for a couple weeks. I had been looking at the X1, V60 and the GLA. the X1 felt cheap and the V60 wasn't equipped the way I wanted. I searched other CUV class vehicles and came up with the GLA. Took a drive and was hooked. I let it sit for three weeks the. Felt terrified someone else would buy it 

Overall, it's great. Good power fun equipment and great gas mileage I'll report more later but ow I'm in love."
car_3630,A delightful car,"I have been driving the GLA250 for about a half year. Absolutely no problems. It was parked outside in last year's Boston extreme winter and drove in the snow and ice like a champion. The car is a delight to drive. Fast with average 26 mpg (90% city, 30-31 mpg on highway at brisk speeds). I find the GLA a beautiful design and I received many compliment for it (often from Europeans who value the practical hatchbacks more than US drivers).What I don't enjoy is the wind noise on the highway, the very little leg room in the back and the low roof line at the front (I am 6'2"")....but all those are compensated well by overall joy driving this car. I tested the BMW X1 and Audi Q3.Nothing changed after a year and a half. The car goes to a Mercedes dealer's service once a year. In between only gas and windshield washer tanks need fill up. Not even the tires needed air since I bought the car. (Here I had a line that claimed that the transmission settings were updated but I was wrong. It was wishful thinking. Sadly.)I had no technical problems in the first two years.UPDATE: Two and a half years of driving the GLA250 the car had no problem whatsoever. The single thing I am very unhappy about is the transmission's ECO mode. That is rather bad for a Mercedes. In the city (especially at slow cornering) the downshifting is delayed and abrupt. It shifts from 3 to 2 with a sudden jerk and unpleasant jump in gear2. The other shortcoming is  - what many complained about - is the tendency of shifting into gear 7 also in ECO at ~ 35 mph which is annoying. The 2016 model has multiple gear options (e.g. comfort) but Mercedes won't bother to make the 2015 models any better by updating the software. This is such a disappointment in this otherwise great car that I am considering trading it in soon for a different brand.YEAR THREE UPDATE:See that for my initial impressions of the GLA250 above. Now the car turned three years old. Still running beautifully. The engine is superb. The transmission as annoying as ever and it was pointed out by a large number of reviewers. MB still does not bother upgrading the shifting properties. That is poor customer support especially because so many of us requested it. I took the car for the third annual service and they told me I need new tires. The car ran only 17500 miles and the Bridgestone Duellers are worn out on the front wheels (not sure whther they rotated them or not). They wanted to sell me that same junk tires again. What more, the Bridgestones come with NO WARRANTY (except defects). No minimum mileage, nothing. This is MB OEM quality and a $40k car. Last time I encountered this kind of tire ""warranty"" was my parents Russian Lada in the 1970s. If Mercedes thinks that this is their entry level car and people will buy higher class Benzes they ought to make a better impression."
car_3631,This car is amazing,"Since taking delivery of my GLA in November 2014 I have grown to love this car. Although it my wife's car I can't get over how fun it is to drive. 
The smooth quite power is amazing the first time I really appreciate this car I was cruising on the FWY at 70 in 7th gear, I needed to accelerate quickly, pressed the gas pedal and the car just took off and never changed a gear.

It's big enough for my golf clubs and luggage for 2 and that's all that matters to us. we did buy the GLA for cargo space just wanted a fun economical car for weekend getaways!"
car_3632,Steering Wheel Module,"When I first bought this car, I was in love with it! Within the first 2 months of driving it, an error popped up on my dash. The dealership told me that my steering wheel module was not working and that the part was on back order, coming from Europe (30 days). You can imagine my disappointment. If that part is on back order you think to yourself, this must happen a lot! I'm almost second guessing buying a Mercedes."
car_3633,"GLA45 one of the fastest CUV ever, if not the fastest!","0-60 in just 4.2 sec and runs the 1/4 in 12.8 at 109 ... and it is a 4 cylinder!  Handles great, sounds even better with the race exhaust.
I looked at the SQ5 and found the outdated shape not thrilling anymore ... Looked at the Porsche Macan but the price with options and the wait time seemed outrageous and then add the maintenance cost and the fact that it rides like a truck ...
I looked at the new Lexus NX but the lack of power and handling seemed weak at best. Same thing with the Q3.  The GLA 250 seemed to be the better deal ... until I tested the GLA45 ...  the rest is history."
car_3634,Fun crossover/hatchback but not an SUV.,"I've had it for a few days, very good car, fun and easy to drive.  I would not consider this an SUV since its sedan height.  I am short and if you move the seat up you have very limited headroom.  Also, wish the keyfob had a hatch close button on it and not just open. You can only close from hatch or in car. Other than that so far so good. Back seat roomy.  Front seats comfortable. Small side mirrors wish they were  alittle bigger.  Very fun to drive. Good on gas."

car_3639,Great car,Great car
car_3640,A disappointing experience,This car has a really significant 'blind spot' caused by the width of the strut between the front and rear doors and the wing mirror is small.  My model has the 'Blind Spot Assist' feature which I find to be unreliable to the point of being dangerous.
car_3641,Great choice for young generations,"Although the noise control and riding comfort is not good as other Mercedes model, it is totally enough for young people. I really don't care about the space of rear seat. The power is great and also it's fuel economy. It's perfect for young people, I enjoy the driving so much."
car_3642,Glam no gutts!,Looked liked a Honda on the inside. Too expensive for what you get. Might as well buy a CRV.
car_3643,I love this car,"I looked very seriously at 4 vehicles before buying the Mercedes GLA 250 : the Volvo V60, the VW Alltrack, and the BMW X1.  The Mercedes has everything that I wanted. It has the Apple CarPlay, which I love. The controls are really easy to read and understand which makes driving the vehicle safer for me because I am not taking time to figure the display out.  BMW -  display was too busy and complex for me. The Volvo, seats not that comfy in my opinion and visibility terrible. The Alltrack was nice  but to be honest, the customer service at the dealership stunk! The salespeople at Mercedes were so attentive and on point the entire time, that the sales process went very smooth. This car has driven like a dream for the 1000 miles I've put on it to date, and I really like it. Cons are that the glovebox is small, the headroom is a bit tight at times if you are tall and the back storage is a little tight, but the drive and comfort on the road and ease of controls, heat, radio, etc. I just love the layout of it all and the interior is very stylish!"
car_3644,Cool Week in Florida with a GLA 250,"Rented a GLA 250 4-matic to drive from West Palm Beach to St. Augustine and back for a wedding.  The front seats were exceptionally comfortable and supportive, and the rear cargo area was plenty for two and our gear.  Not much room in the rear for passengers - which was irrelevant to us.  Performance - acceleration, handling, braking - was exhilarating.  Ride was firm but not harsh while cruising.  Fuel economy was excellent.  Used sport mode around town and economy on the highway, with sport steering setting.  Cruises easily at 100 mph with little road noise and full control.  The engine stop/start feature was an aggravation, with hesitation, so I disabled it.  The transmission was smoother in sport mode than in economy or comfort.  There is a custom feature available too.  Audio was good but not great, and no equalizer controls.  I would opt for the Harmon-Kardon upgrade for $750 (can be ordered separately from various packages).  Burnished aluminum on dash was ugly and reflected too much sun.  Opt for wood.  Electronics were a steep learning curve indeed; but this was a rental with insufficient time to study the manual.  Not intuitive.  I agree the central screen looks like a cheap add-on.  Visibility is limited due to the small windows all around.  I normally drive a Ford Focus hatch with manual tranny, so the outstanding performance and solid quality build was impressive.  Missed the clutch; but there are paddle shifters.  Did not take it offroad; but doubt it would make it over the dune on the Outer Banks.  More of a slick-handling sporty AWD hatch with tremendous performance for the price.  Cannot even imagine driving the AMG version."
car_3645,Best Car to Own!,I loved this car. I was in a really bad rear end accident and these headsets deployed and saved my neck! I am so sorry that the car is totalled! I loved this car so much! Very reliable. Been owner since the purchase and had to give up at 93k miles. Sad:(
car_3646,Love it,"Wonderful car if you want a sporty SUV that doesn't take up a lot of space. Always easy to park in the city, maneuvers well, stylish, comfortable and reliable. But it is a little small if you have 2 or more children."
car_3647,I've Found My Brand.,"Excellent vehicle, all around. Sure, it has some weaknesses, but through and through this thing is an impeccably built tank. I've waited awhile to review this small SUV until living with it for some time (not quite 2 years now). I've previously owned Lexus, Saab, and several BMWs. The GLK demonstrates what Mercedes-Benz is all about, and this is (was) their 2nd least expensive model -- bodes well for the more expensive lines. I've had exactly one problem with the car in nearly 25,000 miles; a failed wheel bearing that the dealer had only ever seen twice before on the GLK. Let's not discuss how many times my SAAB saw the dealer in 25,000 miles, nor the BMW for that matter."
car_3648,It's my Wife's Car...But I always want the keys!,"As the title says I love this crossover.We bought for my wife trading up from a Camry for the MB build quality, cache, edgy looks, vast options list, performance, & impeccable safety.I, on the other hand, love the sportiness, muscular lines, AMG styling & wheels and MB build.Another importance for us was that this crossover stands out in a crowd of blobbed aero shaped vehicle that really are just miniature wannabe of their bigger brethren.Class doesn't mean following the herd."
car_3649,a BMW killer? I don't think so,"The navigation system we paid $1200 for (or more precisely, got robbed for)—it is a piece of junk, worst GPS we ever used and we have used quite a few different brands and models. This is simply the worse than the worst. The interface is extremely clumsy and slow to use, the features are limited, some address cannot be found, wrong routes, etc.The traffic update (TMC) is a joke since you have to manually check the text messages for each road on the list. At 8 time price of a touch screen Garmin 1450 with Life Time Map and Traffic update we got 1/8 of the features, functionalities, accuracy and quality."
car_3650,Awsome for young parents.,"This car is just awsome! Much more fun to drive then station wagons and much more cool then mini vans. Perfect visibility while driving, fab handling and safety features.Perfectly sized family car for one or two children family.Design is just pure awsome Bauhause-ish. Just perfect marriage of form and function.Priced like smaller WV, yet provides all that Mercedes has to offer.Absolute head turner."
car_3651,A 2-wheel Gas Guzzler!,"Leased a 2-wheel drive 2011 GLK-350 from Caliber Motors w/bad lease tuin April this year to replace the 2008 E350 due to too many unsafe blind spots. After driven 3 months of the GLK-350, here are my personal driving experience of this half-breed SUV:Pros:Not too high, not to low, the height is just about right, not too many blind spots as the 2008 E350, better visibility, quiet, good chairs, maneuverability okay Cons:A terrible 2-wheel drive GAS GUZZLER!Gas consumption worse than E350, worse than 1999 ML320.Soft brakes, hesitant accelerating, ugly side mirrors,rear blind spots,worst turning radius, stupid GPS navigator,knob control,small screen,a German JOKE! Bad heat penetrating moon roof"
car_3652,Even my husband loves this little SUV!,"Love everything about this car!Attractive, sporty, quiet, comfortable with intuitive controls, excellent safety features, and luxurious options--all at an excellent price!The rear seat is large enough to comfortably accommodate our 12-year old and 9-year old, and I find the cargo space to be more than adequate for what we typically use it for (groceries, runs to to the recycling center).Would recommend getting the keyless entry and ignition option, though--after owning an Infiniti M45 that had it, it is sorely missed."
car_3653,Better than our former 2008 E350,"We just returned and terminated our 3-year leased 2008 E350 5 months earlier last week and decided to lease this 2-wheel drive GLK-350. We have driven the E350 for the 3rd year but could never get used to it, because every time we got into it, we felt cramped and always got the phobia with lot of blind spots all around, its wheel base is too long to make easy turns into any shopping center entrance opening, as the right rear wheel would often hit and ride on the curb and keep damaging the wheel rim and the tire. The E350 drive side rear-view mirror is equipped with a dark auto-dim film, so it makes the driving at night often impaired and dangerous, and it's a very stupid over-killed fixture."
car_3654,Autobahn crusing (in real life),"Picked up a GLK 350 2WD on overseas delivery in Stuttgart in late March and drove it around southern Germany for a week. Autobahn crusing was effortless, but had to keep it down for breakin mileage. Car was quiet as a vault, controls were intuitive and easy to use. Visibility and comfort were remarkable.Rear luggage area was large enough on the floor for two HUGE suitcases (loaded to maximum airline capacity). Cannot wait for the car to arrive at the dealer. Would highly recommend overseas delivery. 2 for 1 Lufthansa airfare, 7% off the sticker, no destination charge, 2 free nights in $300 plus/night true luxury hotels, 15 days free insurance, full tank of gas, tour of factory, etc. Great."
car_3655,Our First Benz,"When I test drove this vehicle while shopping for a replacement for our 06 Jaguar S-Type, I was surprised that its performance, handling, braking, etc. were very close to the sports sedan I was replacing.We,ve had the GLK for several weeks now, and, I'm more impressed with it with each passing mile.The vehicle is dead quiet on interstate runs, and, steady as a rock.Even though ours is a lightly optioned vehicle, it offers enough features as standard equipment that I'm very satisfied with it.The 3.5 Liter V6 has plenty of grunt, and, the 7 speed transmission is excellent.I've owned several other AWD vehicles, but, this one is far quieter than the others - no annoying gear whine."
car_3656,This Benz is a Babe,"First, I am not into labels, so the MB brand name was not top of mind when I discovered this gem. It has an incomparably smooth ride, is very pleasing on the eye and is loaded with great features at a reasonable price (as far as luxury vehicles go). Just got back from the desert and on a very windy day, this solid vehicle didn't sway or feel pushed. It has good pick- up and I can't wait to finish reading the manuals to learn all the gadgets. Looking forward to a long relationship."
car_3657,Back to MB with a GLK !,"Our family now has 2 reliable MB vehicles. My last car was a Porsche up until I purchased the GLK. So happy to get rid of that unreliable money pit Porsche !  Don't get me started on the dealerships!  Mercedes Benz = great cars and excellent service. 2 ingredients that are essential for motoring happiness.  GLK is just a really well thought out, comfortable, practical, solid, quality SUV. Loaded with all options except for the rear video. I enjoy every minute in my Mobile Office / Hockey Dad / Night Out / Off to the cottage, fits the bill on all accounts. Including the bank!"
car_3658,Great SUV!,"We have owned the GLK-350 for 2 weeks now having moved up from an '06 E-350 sedan.  I must say this SUV was indeed a step up.  I am 6' 3"" tall and found getting in and out of the E-350 sometimes a challenge, but much prefer the entry and exit of the GLK-350.  At cruising speeds of 65 mph, there is very little, if any, engine noise and no air noise at all.  The SUV is built solid.  This SUV is equipped with the P1 package, Multimedia, and AMG appearance package.  It is beautiful and even though we have had it only 2 weeks, we are still very much pleased with our purchase."
car_3659,glk tank,"I've only had it for a short time but so far it is a blast to drive.  It feels very solid, handles like a sports car, reeks of quality and durability, and is actually not too bad on gas.  Not as good as my Eclass, but still decent for a truck.  I wanted an SUV type of a vehicle but not a vehicle that was too big or too clumsy.  This is the perfect car for me and just makes sense.  The utility of an SUV with the handling of a sports car and not a major gas hog like other larger SUVs. The cabin is extremely quiet while driving in varied road conditions, and that's even with the 20 inch AMG wheel package.  The navigation is easy to use and the sound system is fantastic."
car_3660,First Mercedes,Was looking to down size our SUV and found the GLK a great option AMG package set it off! Drives like a sports car with feel of an SUV. I've been a truck/American muscle guy my whole life and the GLK might have won me over!
car_3661,I love this SUV!,This is a great little SUV. It's built in Germany and is as solid as a rock. It handles with precision and has a smooth ride that's comparable to a Mercedes sedan. I test drove it back to back with the C-class and liked the ride in the GLK even better. I like that it doesn't look like every SUV on the road; it's distinctive styling makes it easy to find in a parking lot.
car_3662,2011 Even Better with AMG Package,"Dollar for dollar, the best value out there for performance, luxury and fun factor.  Now with 2011 AMG package, its looks match its performance.  And somehow the 20"" rims with the AMG rider smoother than my 2010.  Great SUV. Don't let the smaller size fool you.  It holds a lot of cargo, yet remains nimble enough to let you think it's a sports car."
car_3663,This SUV is just amazing,"I purchased the 2011 GLK 350 after several test drive comparisons with the competition from Europe and Japan. None of them impressed me nearly as much as the GLK 350. The ride seems actually smoother then our 2008 E350 and the handling is excellent. The engine power transfer and output is great and the handling is responsive and precise. The shift and instruments controls are well placed, simple and easy to use. I am amazed that Mercedes is offering this SUV at such a low price. In my opinion it is the best value in the SUV market not just in the premium SUV class.  We just came back from a sightseeing trip and couldn't be happier with this SUV."
car_3664,I loved my car,"I enjoyed every moment I owned this car. I bought it certified pre owned with 27 000 miles and drove it with just routine maintenance and regular synthetic oil changes every 5000 miles. Only had brakes and totors and tires to replace which is normal. at about 130000 miles I had to replace intake manifold because my engine light went on at a cost of about $1300.00. Soon after that the engine light goes on again on and off for a month or two. I had it checked and mechanic said maybe the computer has to rest itself after the repair. Being a patient person It sounded feasable that this could have been the problem ans so I continued to drive the vehicle. The check engine light keeps coming on and the code said that the Catalytic converter is bad. I priced the Cats and they cost $1800.00 apiece and there are tow in a GLK. Thats $3600.00 just to buy them and then the labor to install them. At 145000 miles I wasnt going to put another 5000.00 into the GLK. It was a 2010. But I loved this car and other than the Cats needing replacement the car was in mint condition. I didnt want any other type car because I loved this one so much. So, I traded it in for another 2014 GLK certified pre owned and love it to death. More technology and more features and i still am a GLK fan.  Hopefully the CATS wont go on this one. Fingers crossed"
car_3665,I Love My Car But...,"I Love my Car. We are around 110000 miles now. Over all I love everything about my car except I always need to fix it. My car lock needed to be fixed, that was $1000 Seals around the doors are cracking. Chrome trim around cup holders are peeling. Buttons are wearing off. Middle console it scratching. Basically anything plastic will and has fallen apart. I know it sounds all horrible but my car in almost mint condition and all these things are things only I would notice since I detail my car daily but the fact is I have noticed. I've spent $3000 in maintenance this year. Over all I love my car it handles well, I feel special driving it. But if you don't have the extra cash I'd say pass."

car_3668,2010 with 64k has been a Great Car,"We bought a 2010 with 28k and 2-years on it. Everything has been great.  The only issue we've had existed when we bought it -- a worn ""arm"" in the front-end steering.  The cost was relatively low to repair -- I think $150.  No other repairs or problems to report.  I have used MB to performed the 50k and 60k service, which was pricey and probably not worth the cost, but work keeps me busy and don't have time or the interest to mess with it.    My wife loves the car and I have to admit that I really enjoy zipping around in it, too.  It has great acceleration and turns on a dime.  Getting in/out of our side-enterence garage is a piece of cake!!   We'll probably buy a low-miles 2015 in another few years."
car_3669,Good little car,"Good car. Very reliable. Bought with 8k mikes in 2011. Now have 90k. Never had anything other than oil changes done to it. I do NOT recommend the 20 inch wheels. They go through tires fast. Needs more storage. Don't like the angle of the backseat. Also don't like the curve of the backseat next to the door. Makes it hard for car seats to properly fit. It gets good mpg in flatter terrain. But in the small mountains of Arkansas, I'm getting about 9mpg. It's a great compact SUV, very capable. Having to get rid of it due to my child needing more legroom. Would buy again if they could upgrade storage and me the backseat larger."
car_3670,Classy ride,"I purchased my 2010 glk350 with 36,000 miles on it. It was a dealer certified car and feld comfortable with my choice of vehicle, being I also own a 2005 ML350 since new with over 80,000 miles on it and love it as well. My GLK is a smaller version of the ML, and performs every bit as well as the larger vehicle. The ML is a bit more cushy and plush as faras the ride, but thats it in my opinion. My GLK is peppy, reliable, great in the snow and ice with great traction, and is fantastic on dry roads at any speed. I feel great driving this car and recommend it highly. You won't be dissappointed?"
car_3671,Great!!,"Bought mine Oct 2011. It's a 2010 and had 30,000 miles on it. It's been 4 months, I have put 10,000 miles on it and I LOVE it. It's comfortable and reliable and I get so many compliments on it. I'm ready for it to snow so I can see how it performs on snow and ice."
car_3672,GLK Transmission Problem,"I have a 2010 Mercedes GLK with 17,000 miles.I just had to get the transmission replaced.At first they told me it was the wheel bearings.Then the next day they called me and said it was not the wheel bearings but instead they needed to replace the transmission.I went online and saw other owners with the same problem! I was thinking about buying the car after my lease is up but I just changed my mind.Not sure what other problems are lurking."
car_3673,Two years later and still loving it!,"We have driven it 14,000 miles so far over the past two years-it has been flawless in every way.Feels solid like it was carved out of one piece of steel, handles great and looks terrific.Average about 19mpg in town-highway is a better."
car_3674,2010 GLK350,"Great car mechanically however, if you are over 5'8"" tall and weigh more than 180 pounds, not the car for you!After 13500 miles, the drivers side door rubber and interior molding is completely worn out from entrance and exit ""rubbing""!!Poor quality materials as far as I am concerned.When taken and shown to the dealer he indicated this wear was not covered by warranty.Would expect this after 40 - 50 thousand miles but not from a new car, especially a mercedes. Stay aware if your an average person!!"
car_3675,Love it!,"Great car!!! Have had it for a few months now and have been driving it in snow storms and long highway trips, and it handles any task.Love it!"
car_3676,I love my GLK!,"It was time for me to turn in my 2005 MB C240 lease, and I had no idea which MB I wanted next. My husband spotted the GLK and we decided to test drive it. I loved it immediately, and we leased it on the spot. I drive it every day and am only 5'2"", but my husband, who is 6'4, drives it on trips and loves it too. It is zippy, gets great gas mileage, and is very solid. I love the interior features and it the Command system is really easy to use.  I am going to lease another one when this one ends in July 2012!"
car_3677,"Solid, Small, Classy  SUV","I have had the GLK for about 1 week now after driving a BMW X5. It has everything..I wanted something smaller in AWD/SUV that handled like a sports car, GLK is smaller, drives like a car but you sit a bit higher. This is definitely a smaller SUV than a BMW X3. Handles well, not as smooth driving as X5, but much better drive than a BMW X3 which I also have owned. Takes bumps well, looks classy and different than everything else in a SUV on the road. Navigation is easy to control, bells and whistles are plentiful but not too difficult once you review the manual. Gas mpg about 18 for city/hwy mixed driving. I'm 5'3"" so getting in and out is easy for me which was an important consideration."
car_3678,Saw it. Fell in love. Still in love!,"I LOVE my GLK! After purchase and p/u in Stuttgart, Germany, was even more impressed with the customer service provided by MB! I relocated (military) to Alaska, and it handles SO WELL up here in the Arctic terrain/snow/ice. The ride is comfortable and safe! The quality of the build is exceptional and feels ""solid.""  The remote latching system is wonderful when your hands are full.  Vehicle is reliable, in which i look for here in -40 to -60 degree weather. Impressed that not even ONE hairline surface scratch has developed after 20+ washings!  The ceramic coat paint job makes the difference!  Remember that properly maintained vehicles last a lifetime!  That is out of MB's Hands!"
car_3679,Amazing Benz,"I love this car. I traded in my 2008 Saab 9-3 aero xwd for it. I loved my saab so much but I needed more room and since I moved to the city, got tired of the standard transmission. The GLK has great edgy looks and a powerful V6. The 268 hp in this car feels so much better than in the ML350 since it weighs hundreds of pounds less. Great long distance comfort and very stable at high speeds. Had it up to 120 and it felt rock solid as a true Mercedes should."
car_3680,Disappointed,"This vehicle has been a huge disappointment to me.  It broke down and had to be towed in 20 degree temperatures when it had 1,100 miles. It needed a new gear shifter and the part took five days to find.  Then the check engine light came on when it had 5,700 miles and it had a defective charcoal canister (a fuel problem) which had to be replaced. That part took three days to find. Fortunately the vehicle is still under warranty.  I am going to be getting rid of it because I cannot trust it and I will never get another Mercedes-Benz again."
car_3681,Second thoughts,"We loved the car until twice the car ESP system went haywire and the car lost power, shook like a washing machine and lost steering. Pretty scary. No explanation could be found, every computer test passed, yet this happened twice,  Could lead to an accident. Trying to follow up with a second check up but I doubt the cause will show up."
car_3682,GLK 350 AWD,"The best looking, full of fun features and comfort I have ever seen in a vehicle."
car_3683,Great Car,"Love it, in Mars Red, or Fire Opal in Canada. Drove a few thousand KM so far and it's fantastic, AC is amazing no hot or cold spots. The ride is good and the seats comfortable. Easy in and out. Sun shade a great feature, all the electronics are useful too. Gas premium only, not so great, but OK, to get performance."
car_3684,Very pleased,"Very solid, sharp vehicle.  Feels like it is carved out of one piece of steel."
car_3685,GLK great lookin kat,I love it. I just got a White one with the 20 inch wheels multimedia package and premium one package.   It is so nice but I had it for three days and I already need to get gas and I only drove 20 miles to work.
car_3686,This is my cream puff,"If I could adore a car, it would be this one.  Everything is right.  I have 0 problems. This is a solid car that performs well at both high and low speeds.  I have a lead foot on the freeway, so my mileage is not the best (18 mpg) in the city. Unfortunately, it uses premium gas.  At 80 the car handles just as well as it does at 25.  The sound system is excellent. If I had to criticize the car, the blue tooth is not 100%.  The interior controls are well thought out and easy to use.  Spacious, comfortable, feels good, looks good.  This is not my first Mercedes. I grew up with the brand and by far, this is my favorite."
car_3687,Best car in the world,"This car is almost impeccable. Its stable, handles like the C, and is more then comfortable. Its incredibly smooth but can still handle excellently. A definite buy."
car_3688,Love it!,"I love the driving this vehicle. Definitely the new generation of SUV from MB. I like the classic design (means wont be out of fashion). Impressive torque, and of course all the bells and whistles which step-up to the standards."
car_3689,Love the car!,Just came off a 3 year lease of a BMW x3. Looking for a smaller SUV like the Mercedes 350 GLK. This car drives sooo much smoother than my X3! Even my husband fell in love with the car. I feel so safe in this solid car. I have the black and silver running boards on a black car. Very smart looking. I am soooo happy!!!
car_3690,Everything I expected,I had been looking at this vehicle since it hit the MBUSA website in 6/08. I loved the styling inside and out.  I got the premium package 1 with navigation and I-pod.  Everything has worked like a dream since I purchased in 11/09. I drive very conservatively and have been able to get 22 average mpg in city/highway driving. I have been waiting to write a review until I took it on a road trip. On a 2000 mile trip I still only got 22.5 mpg. Not too disappointed though since it was so much fun to drive. I also purchased chrome handle inserts and rubber floor mats. The chrome inserts add a touch of class and the floor mats will add durability because I plan on having this car a long time.
car_3691,Almost missed out,"We had looked at and test drove the RX350 and Q5.  We had decided on buying the Q5 when my wife saw an ad for the GLK.  As soon as we got in the car and drove the first quarter mile I was sold.  It is a solid, quiet, well built car.  Although the GLK is not as big as the RX350 and Q5 I am 6 foot 240 lbs and have plenty of room whether in the driver, passenger, or back seat.  Love the heated seats and COMMAND system.  Noticed others have commented on brake and transmission problems.  I have had none, brakes and trans are solid just like the rest of the car. What struck me was you do not have to raise your voice to be heard, even at freeway speeds.  Beautiful car."
car_3692,"Saw it, Bought it Love it","This car handles well in the city. I love the interior as well as the exterior. It certainly is not a family car , but I didn't purchase it for a family. I bought it for me. And I love it. The only down side is gas mileage. I don't sit in the , so I can't complain about the leg room. I haven't had any service related problems at all. The add oil light came on once. I added the oil and kept driving. I'm totally sold on this car."
car_3693,Wow-Get one before they raise the price,"I got this vehicle on a day that a major storm ravaged the NJ area. I had to get out of Dodge quickly and I packed the kids, dog, etc. into the new Merc.  I was thrilled with the vault-like stability and the ""hewn from a block of granite"" feel.  Features are terrific. The voice- activated ""COMMAND"" system is the best I've experienced.  This thing makes my Range Rover almost obsolete.(almost)  Years of trauma surgery makes me want to have my family in a tank, and the GLK feels like exactly that. Bonus- this thing handles better than the CLK CAB that I traded for--and worlds more practical. The fact that the GLK is assembled in Bremen is readily apparent. After years of complacency MB is back."
car_3694,Great Car,Fantastic car - good compromise between utility and fun to drive. Impeccable build quality. Very happy with the purchase.
car_3695,German Tank,"I love this car. It feels like it's been carved from a solid block of steel. Absolutely nothing rattles. I've had this car for a year and nothing has gone wrong with it. It has great acceleration and it handles the road well for an SUV. If anything, the steering is too lively when you first drive it. I get 22 mpg on the highway (80 mph)and 16 mpg in the city. Mine is black with the 19"" wheels and the dealer threw in tinted windows. The car looks so much better in person than it does in photographs. I test drove a Lexus, Land Rover, and BMW. I liked this SUV better. I have read other people here complain about brakes, but my brakes have been fine. It's done everything I've asked of it."
car_3696,Paint and body work worst than anything,"Don't buy Mercedes. I have S550 and GLK350 Both purchased new.  The S550 got very bad transmission when shift in automatic from 2nd to 3rd gear.  Engine vibrate and shake the whole car when unexpected.  Rear tires only last 10K miles. it always wear out in the center, I use recommended tire pressure of 35psi.   GLK350 Very bad paint job.  The clear coat got dust all over the car.  The hood gap on left and right are at least 1/2 different.  It's a brand new car, this kind of gap only happens on car with front end accident.  You don't expect these problem from brand new Mercedes!"
car_3697,Could be better,"I had this SUV for a year now and I must admit that MB has not yet sorted out transmission and brakes on this model.  It seems that ""electronic brain"" is not governing transmission shifts correctly and is very evident during ""stop and go"" traffic: 1-to-2 gear shift, during downshift or at brake time.  Just touching the brakes, creates an immediate and unnecessary downshift, sometimes more than one gear.  Good vehicle for someone who does not care how it drives - just gets there.  Although, it is very good in the snow.  During cold weather, electronic cluster displays erroneous messages (Low Coolant and Washer Level) and front shocks made strange noise, until the car warms up."
car_3698,Worst car ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great service at the dealer, got hypnotized by the Mercedez salesman.  Got the car, big disappointment. The fuel economy is the worst, no leg room in the rear seat.  Can't go on a long trip with this car. You have to press brakes long before stopping. No luxurious at all. Front seats very small. 6' male won't fit. This is not a suv feels, this is like a little car, just to go and buy groceries. Just because it got the Mercedez emblem, that's not mean is driven and feel like a Mercedez. Doesn't come with seat warmers, to open the car you'll would have to open all the locks, not just the drivers.  You'll have to open the locks, when in vehicle to release passengers in back seat. Big mistake."
car_3699,Great Car so far,"My positive reactions to this car far out way any negative feelings. We have had severe snow for the last three weeks and it seems impossible to get stuck. It goes through everything. The upright angle of the windshield tends to collect too many bugs during summer and the climate controls and cruise control lever are in an poor location. Power is reminiscent of the V8s back in the 60s except smooth. I have gotten up to 24 MPG on a long trip driving at 65 the whole way and I have gotten as low as 17 when pushing the gas peddle harder. Back seat room is minimal and there is not much space for holding things outside the glove box, or in the glove box for that matter. The ride is sweet and quiet."
car_3700,BIG Disappointment,"My wife likes the vehicle and it looked good on the showroom. Ours was specially ordered and shipped with most options. Disappointments are the brake system, extreme dead travel, I actually rear ended (bumped) another car. The brakes have not worked correctly to the point where when we got home you could see heavy smoke from the front disks and they were red hot. The computer must erratically actuate the brakes at normal highway speeds and it causes the car to swing from side to side and makes the transmission labor intensively and the engine temperature starts climbing. This has happened a handful of times and we have taken it in for service and nothing can be found that is abnormal. No good."
car_3701,Best medium size SUV,"After each driving it for 10mn, both my wife and I were sold to this little marvelous SUV. Quality of the workmanship is visible in every details. Engine with 268 HP, 250 pounds of torque and the 7 speed automatic transmission are a perfect match to deliver plenty of power when needed. Car handling is similar to a sporty sedan, extra eight of an SUV is not felt at all. We look at Q5, X60, X3 which are great vehicles but they are no match for what the GLK delivers overall."
car_3702,Great Luxury Crossover Vehicle,"My wife fell in love with this vehicle immediately.  I too was very impressed.  Everything about our vehicle is great except for the brake - - too much dead travel.  I had several close call with rear ending another vehicle.  We even took the vehicle in for brake pad replacement, but the result is the same.  They say that it performs and functions to factory specification.  I guess, we just have to get used to braking early.  Overall, get luxury vehicle and worth the extra money over its Japanese competition -- rather no comparison."
car_3703,2nd Benz,"The reviews that say the GLK is built like a tank are spot on. This thing is solid! The GLK's exterior look is polarizing (love it or hate it) but I like the boxy shape since it denotes function over form. There are way too many ""SUVs"" that are all curvy but at the expense of usable cargo space.  I bought the GLK because I wanted something that was extremely safe to drive, was well built, had decent handling, good acceleration and offered a fair amount of utility. I did not buy it because I wanted to get good gas mileage, needed to haul more than 4 adults or lots of cargo.  Given those parameters, I am extremely satisfied with the GLK thus far."
car_3704,Fun Fun Fun,"I tested several small SUV before I bought this car.  I have to admit it i love driving this car.  The GLK is very fun to drive, classy and it handle very well.  The onlything is that the leg room in the back is kind of small. I wish they add a couple more inch in the back."
car_3705,my thoughts on the GLK,"So far so good! The car has a handsome exterior and interior. It's nice inside, but not cozy like an E class. I don't mind however because you can't have it all. The acceleration is a little bit of a disappointment, but I can deal with it because the handling makes up for it. The car feels fairly tight in turns, smooth, quiet like you're in your own world, and solid. Oh, and the headlights look pretty nice even without having the bi-xenons. That was a pleasant surprise. Overall it's a good value for being a baby Benz."
car_3706,Great Car,"I bought this car in August after doing a quick look at the Q5 and XC60. The Q5 was too expensive with the options I wanted, and XC60 wasn't as refined. You will enjoy the creamy engine and transparent shifting. IF you do live in a cratered environment like northern NJ, forego the appearance pkg and keep the 19"" wheels. It handles like a sedan around corners with little body lean but the rear suspension does jostle a bit over rough pavement. I am extremely impressed with the quality of reliability of this car as well as its vault-like solidity. The COMAND system really sold this car for me, its absolutely amazing! If you can handle its small size, it really is a gr8 buy!"
car_3707,Panzerkampfwagen,"Our lease was up on our '07 X3.  We looked at the GLK, LR2, and Volvo XC60. None of them drove as percisely as the X3, however as this is my wife's vehicle comfort is more important than sportiness.  The GLK by far was the most refined in terms of quietness and smooth ride.  While the GLK is not quite as roomy as the X3 (backseat and cargo area) it has a very relaxed manor about it - while the X3 is always taut.  Both have impeccable build quality - really outstanding, with an edge going to the GLK for a satisfying door shut, although the X3 has superior inside door handles.  I recommend the GLK for its refined comfort in a tidy sized package.  Aggressive drivers need not apply."
car_3708,A Sports Car/SUV,"I purchased my GLK in May, with all the bells and whistles. Love the light grey/black and wood interior. Last car was a King Ranch Expedition @ 14 mpg. Glad to see the overall avg of 20 I'm getting with the GLK. The Nav system, bluetooth recognition for my I-Phone, safety are all pluses. Obviously, less room but after all it is a smaller SUV. I find the lift gate and space more than adequate.  Lots of power for passing on highways! Comfortable, quiet, and fun to drive. My GLK is well appointed, quality workmanship, and appearance. I have the 20 inch wheels and premium black finish. No defects in the paint or elsewhere. No negatives - easy to drive, great handling, just a terrific car!"
car_3709,a great compact SUV,great classic exterior and interior look; solid handling at high speed and smooth ride in commuter traffic; and a superb sound system that make driving more than about the getting there.
car_3710,Great But Not Perfect,"Remember it's a baby Benz SUV and not a sports car.But the 20""SportWheelOption/Suspension makes it feel like it could be.Make sure yours comes with the Pirelli's and not the Dunlops.The Dunlops wear out twice as fast.Steering may be a little too tight/it fails to re-center smoothly. Engine/Tranny are outstanding.Interior is great up front/too tight in rear.Some interior panels don't line- up well. Get the BiXenon/side illum option if you drive at night. Do get MudFlaps and CargoTray.Ours came std with the CargoCover. Paint does have some orange-peel.Fit on some exterior panels not even and a bit wide for a Benz. RoadHazIns.not worth it. Otherwise this intro Benz SUV is quite stunning...bye!"
car_3711,One word: Awesome!!!!!!!,I owned my GLK for a month now. I used to own a ML350 and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My GLK drives like a sport/luxury sedan but roomy as a small SUV. Compared to my ML350 spends less gas.  If you are a young professional who can not choose between and SUV and a Sports car GLK is the ticket. Make sure to get the Xenon packet and sports packet since they really set the car apart. Real head turner ;)
car_3712,1st MB and Luvin' It,"After fours years in an Armada our lease was up and my wife wanted to downsize.  We test drove several cars including the X5, MDX, and a decked out Murano.  When they pulled up the GLK for a test drive at the Houston North dealership, my wife left me little room for negotiating the price with a solid, ""We'll take it"".  It was love at first sight for her and she thanks me everyday for the purchase.  Being the mother of two teenage boys, she rarely leaves the neighborhood but we still get around 18 mpg with an average speed of a mere 25 mph.  I rarely get to drive it but everytime I do I am impressed with the handling, the power and above all else, the quietness. A solid 10 for the money."
car_3713,From a C to  a G -GLK that is!,"I recently purchased the GLK. In the process of buying the car I test drove everything. It took me months to make up my mind. I should mention the criteria for choosing this car. Size, Speed, Comfort, Visibility,road noise, interior noise and I would be lying if I didn't say status. I came from a C280, so the controls were all placed in a familiar location. The ride is smooth and quick to handle. I should also mention I sold my VW Toureg. That VW handled the road beautifully but it was too big for my size (f 5'6"" 140 lbs.) also every-time I turned around the battery went dead or the tire pressure warning would appear on the dash! So I wanted 1 vehicle to do all that and handle NE winters-"
car_3714,Best vehcile we've bought so far.,"Bought this under the European Delivery Program. Picked it up in Sindelfingen, Germany and drove it first on the Autobahn. Great insurance & service. Loved driving in Europe. Car drives great. Very good and solid road feel. Very comfortable for the front passengers. Rear seats feel a little cramped for knee room. Our kid is in a M-Benz toddler seat (great seat with very nice head rest for sleeping - worth the extra $/Euros) and her feet touch the front seat back all the time. We also got the rear Entertainment system with dual screens, Universal Media Interface (that only gets installed when car arrives in the US at MB preparation center). Panoramic roof is very nice."
car_3715,brake issue,"Purchased 20l0 GLK on 02/l4/09.  Brakes were soft and spongy.  In May 2009, daughter drove the car and commented on the brakes not stopping when pressed immediately.  Took car through a car wash and on the way home, brakes failed at a traffic light and I hit a car on the left side bumper and taillight.  I have been driving 55 years and have never had an accident.  Mercedes Benz of Knoxville said they knew of no brake problems and would have Mercedes USA look into the matter.  It took 40 days to get my car repaired and cost me $900 additional in rental car expenses.  Told Mercedes of Knoxville that I liked the car, but was afraid to drive it.  Said they would trade with me for $ll,000 more."
car_3716,Great Ride,"Only had the car a few weeks. Had the illuminated door sills installed after purchase and had a problem at the dealer with this. If you want this option, order it factory installed. Major project! Looks great though. Took it on a 2000 mile trip through Arizona and Nevada, had no problems. Gas mileage was a shocker although I should have known this beforehand."
car_3717,Quality car!,"We bought our GLK 4Matic in July, 2009. I love the way it handles, good quality ride, quiet and comfortable as you would expect with Mercedes Benz. Fuel economy in town with the AC on is about 18 mpg, but we knew that when we purchased the car. The power lift gate is definitely worth it. Leather should be included.We purchased the sport pkg., the multi-media package and the nav. Very happy with all these features. This little suv is a sure ""head turner""!"
car_3718,Comfortable Capable Cruiser; Unreliable,"Traded in a leased MB ML350 and decided to downsize now that the kids are driving alone. Had several unresolved issues with the ML but decided to give MB a fresh chance. Overall, my wife and I enjoy driving this 'right sized SUV'. I'm 6'2"" but I fit comfortably and the position is good although rear seat comfort and room is cramped. Large double sunroof is nice touch. Nice interior design but cheap/loose bits have surfaced in less than 6 months 7k miles. Fuel is acceptable at 17MPG average. Reliability has been horrific- two individual instances of electrical failure in the stability control system/ABS/ESP. Navigation sys was replaced. Climate control failure, was waiting 3 weeks for part."
car_3719,Absolutely LOVE my Benz,"After six months of agonizing research, price comparisons and test drives on three cars; the Toyota Highlander, the Nissan Murano and the Mercedes Benz GLK 350, I finally chose the biggest bang for my buck and in doing so made the best decision of my life.  I chose the Mercedes Benz GLK 350. My little tank drives like a race car and rides like a luxury SUV. The GLK is solid-built, luxurious and quality-filled.  I would recommend to everyone who asks.  Love all the looks, thumbs up and second takes my Benz gets too.  It's an absolute beautiful car with a sporty look.  The engineering on this car far exceeds any other models. So far no problems whatsoever and I am so glad I chose my MB GLK."
car_3720,Euro Delivery For Savings!,"Our first MB product.  Perfect size, solid and quick!  We used the MB European Delivery Program (EDP) configuring the GLK to our exact specifications, saved 7% off MSRP and enjoyed MB hospitality throughout the delivery process.  Our only regret was that a Diesel option was not available.  Highly recommended vehicle and program."
car_3721,A Great Little SUV,"I've had my GLK 350 a week now, and I love it--particularly the styling and comfortable ride and the vault-like build quality. It doesn't look like every other compact SUV on the road. It has a very masculine look (unlike the melted soap bar profile of so many smaller SUVs)."
car_3722,Best MB I've owned,"I was skeptical when I traded my ML350 for the GLK350.  But, the GLK is much easier to handle.  I'm not sure how reliable it will be.  My ML was only 2 years old with only 6100 miles on it and ESP, Ignition, and Brakes were all problems.  I would have bought a Honda, but they would not take the ML on trade.  So, MB bought it back at Half the price I paid (29K, paid 59K), and that was only if I bought another MB.  I'm hoping for better luck with the GLK.  At least this time I only spent 40K."
car_3723,"Not perfect, but we're enjoying it so far","We've had our GLK350 AWD for a few weeks and are pleased overall with the purchase. The car inspires head- turning everywhere we go, and the driving experience is top-class. Seat comfort is exceptional, as are the quiet ride and visibility on all sides. Build quality seems excellent, other than a finicky rear liftgate. Sometimes it stops after raising about 6 inches - could be user error, but everything else is working great. Fuel economy is abysmal, as advertised. Hopefully rumors of a diesel version are true. Other minor complaints include the spongy brakes (you really need to lay on them, unusual for a German luxury car), lack of PDA holder, cruise wand placement and lack of RT traffic."
car_3724,Noise uncovers manufacturing problem,"I purchased a new 2010 GLK in April. About 1-1/2 months into owning the car, I heard a popping noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. I took the car into servicing on June 30th and technicians quickly found and acknowledged the noise. It turns out - after taking apart the passenger side rear cargo paneling - that some tack welding on the frame did not take place during car assembly in Germany.  This is causing two metal pieces to rub and pop while driving the vehicle. An MBUSA chassis technician had to visit the dealership's service department to view the problem. It has taken MBUSA until July 10th to offer a possible repair solution and they still aren't confident this will work 100%."
car_3725,Comfortable but not reliable,"I loved that GLK350 was so smooth, it is my first Mercedes.  My SUV was purchase on 5/21/2009, and at 90 miles the radio/command center would not power on.  So I brought the SUV to the dealer they checked it out for a day and said there was nothing wrong.  A week later at 110 miles the Tire Pressure Monitoring system malfunctioned.  And would report tire pressure issues.  Now it just says Tire Pressure Monitoring system is inoperable.  And the radio still dies.  I have brought the car back to dealership and they are looking into these issues. Its been a day and still they don't know whats wrong :(  If you are considering buying GLK350 you should think twice.  As the build quality is sub par."
car_3726,2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class GLK350 4dr,I always dreamed of owning a Benz and this car I saw and loved it. After driving it for couple weeks now I have no regrets. Ride and Handling is perfect. Price is very reasonable for the car.
car_3727,Excellent small SUV,"This is a good quality, German car. Very reliable. Feels extremely safe."
car_3728,solid very well built,"My wife bought a new Lexus RX .I bought the Mercedes GLK. My wife says hers is more of a woman's SUV the GLK is more of a man's SUV. Her Lexus has been in the shop 2 times in 4 months (2351 miles) Mercedes-Benz 5014 miles O times in shop. I won but lost she now drives the GLK and I have to drive the Lexus RX this stinks (boring,boring,boring).I will be trade my wife's Lexus in this week end."
car_3729,Great Vehicle,I always dreamed of buying and owning a Benz and when I saw this beauty I had to get it. After driving it for three weeks now I have no regrets. It feels like a rugged luxury SUV yet drives like a race car. It takes off like a rocket but drives so smooth. Love everything about the car.
car_3730,Love My Car,"I've only driven my car a few times and I am in Love.  It's fun to drive, the maneuverability is great, the ride is comfortable, the look turns heads, I've got a couple of thumbs-up from other drivers.  The size is perfect for me.  I just turned over my leased ML 350, which I totally loved, I find this easier to drive and more fun. I got the 20"" wheels and find the ride just as nice as the 19"" wheel, I test drove both, and felt the 20's were great and I think they look better ."
car_3731,Great lines,Best looking small SUV out there. Price is very reasonable. Smooth ride found in E class. I love the true dual exhaust.
car_3732,Strong Class Entry,"I looked at other CUVs- Highlander, x3-  GLK was the strongest value for the dollar, significantly cheaper than the x3.  Having owned Volvo, BMW, Audi and Lexus (and a Toyota Highlander), I feel like I have a good idea of how a car should handle, ride and feel in a given price segment.  The GLK delivers on all fronts, hands down.  Bank vault solidity, no body flex to speak of and air bags galore.  Styling is truly the most significant of all in the CUV class- clean lines, no ""melted bar of soap"" styling."
car_3733,LOVE THIS CAR,"The GLK Blow me away.  I have to say that the is GLK built like a tank and drives like sports car.  I got my GLK Fully loaded except for the Lighting package. I have 2 kids and a wife, and we fit nicely. The gas mile is OK. The power is great. The handling can't be any better. The leather package is more comfortable the the MBTex Leather this car is incredible! I Highly recommend it to anyone.  I'm Still breaking it in. Can't wait to hit it!"
car_3734,MY MISTAKE,"I purchased the GLK 350 4matic 3 weeks ago and traded in my Lexus RX330 fromo 2004.  That was the biggest mistake I could have made.  My Lexus never needed to go into the shop for repairs beside the regular maintenance.  My GLK has already been iin the service dept 3 times in 3 weeks.  Maybe I bought a lemon and if the problems persist I will be filing for lemon law.  I have had instrument problems, electrical issues and some of the fit and finish has not been up to par.  I just wish I could turn back time so I didnt trade in my other car."
car_3735,GLK  on the go,"purchased 3 18 09.in shop twice for radio.drove range rover,looked at lexus sold on looks of glk.drive very well.I THINK IT SHOULD BURN MIDDLE GRADE GAS. A finu suv.With the cost there should have benn acargo net and acargo  cover"
car_3736,Best Deal Out There,"It was the new Volvo that stops iyself, the new Lexus that flies over traffic, or the 'old' BMX X3.  Drove them all and liked them all.  The Benz was the best deal, hands down.  Drives and feels like a Mercedes, which only a Benz feels like. Stereo, Navigation, Bluetooth all excellent.  Highly recommend."
car_3737,Surprisingly Fun,I'm amazed at the people complaining about mileage during the break in period of the car driving in winter. Love this car-my last 2 were a Highlander and an x-3  this vehicle puts them to shame.  Haven't had any brake issues so far so good.  Great experience!!!!
car_3738,Comfort and Utility -,"After four satisfying years in a BMW 3- series, I decided to mix it up a bit. After test-driving the Toyota Venza, BMW X3, VW Tiguan, Ford Edge, Acura RDX, and Porsche Cayenne, it took only 15 minutes in the GLK to make up my mind.  This is a chiseled, tough- looking little CUV that drives serenely and quietly, but that also pours on the coal when needed.  I went with a loaded version that includes leather, rear-seat DVD, tow package, and Premium One + Nav, and I truly feel like I'm in a strong, beautifully- made, and multi-use vehicle that is small enough to handle like a car and big enough to carry chairs to our storage facility.  It's not an inexpensive car, but doesn't feel like one either!"
car_3739,Bravo M-B Class Act all the Way!,Handles & drives better then the Best of them. Truly car like with all the luxuries of cars costing much MORE!I gave up my Audi A5 with NO Regrets! .9 interest rate sealed the deal!!
car_3740,IMPRESSIVE RIDE!!!,"I recently purchased the GLK350 after an exhaustive search for a new vehicle.  I researched and drove Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and Nissan but none compare to this vehicle.  The GLK is comparably priced to a fully optioned Toyota or Honda but much more fun to drive and its not like every other vehicle on the road.  I am not sure why others are getting such low gas mileage (driving style???) but I am getting 19-21 in the city as as much as 25 on the highway and I ""get on it"" from time to time.  I didn't get a fully optioned GLK. (no multi media PKG) but im impressed.  The ride is very nice and as of yet, no problems, (4000 miles on ODO). Love the looks and the ""solid feel"".  A real hit in my book."
car_3741,I like the looks!,"My dealer found one on the boat in my color, loaded and at 0.9% APR. They will take $2300 off MSRP with no problem (dealer prep can be knocked down too). The running boards look nice and prevent door dings, but are a detriment to getting in and out. MB won't be making any GLKs until June that will have the automatic fold function for the rear view mirrors. The mirrors are supposed to be heated automatically at low ambient temps, but will that be available in June as well, or does that work now? When talking to the Finance guy he will ask about other options like paint protection etc. He will knock off about $200 from each and everything because he gets credit (points) for these additions."
car_3742,Beats the X3 by a mile (or three)!,"Just having gotten rid of our 2 year lease on the X3, this is a delightful vehicle! It's been 100% trouble free for over 2500 miles and 2 months now...WAY better ride and handling than the X3....(my fillings are staying in my teeth!) Contrary to others' opinions, I think the build quality and finish on the interior are very nice....and the MB-Tex is great stuff....who needs leather!? Our first MB.....and WON'T be our last if this a good indicator of their current line up!"
car_3743,Baby Benz SUV,"Looked at this as needed something good on gas as switched from Telecommuter to having to go into an Office. The estimated mpg of 24-33 with combine 29mpg very attractive. Also, wanted AWD and the higher sitting position. Unfortunately, vehicle is not made for a taller person (I'm 6'3""). I Could not find a comfortable driving position even with all the adjustments. Barely could get in/out of backseats as the rear doors are small and do not open that far. The dashboard/instrument cluster color combination of Silver/Gold/White made it extremely difficult to see the numbers on the gauges. Overall, the vehicle was just too small for me and my family of 5."
car_3744,Mercedes has done it again!,"I drove the Volvo XC60, the Audi Q5, the VW Toureg.  None handled as well, or had the build quality of the Mercedes.  Oddly enough, the Mercedes was the lowest price. I have had my GLK for 2 weeks.  It is a pleasure to drive, and, unlike some other reviewers, I do not have any complaints about the gas mileage (I am getting around 20mpg).  My previous car (and Audi A4) only got 22. I would highly recommend this vehicle."
car_3745,Glad I was able to find this car,This car stopped production in 2015. Too bad. I love the look and performance. Just the right size.
car_3746,Easy to love and great value,"I was about to buy a 2 year old X3 when it was sold on my way to the dealer.  I went out the same day to shop around and ended up stopping in for my first time at MB.  My wife and I saw the GLK for the first time (Jan 3rd, not on the road yet) and feel in love.  I was also considering the c300 but the value is just not the same.  The CUV provides a very roomy ride up front and room I can live with in the rear.  I love the steel panels instead of the usual wood.  That immediately tells me this is the car of 'now'.  It might be dated in a few years but right now it is hot.  My brakes squeak a lot but the dealer has helped a bit.  It is expensive to run but worth it if you want to look important"
car_3747,Stepping up to a Mercedes Benz,Love the boxy look and full window viewing of this model SUV.  It's offers a comfy ride.  Love it!
car_3748,So Far So Good,"I traded my 08 CTS4 and never looked back. Both vehicles had the same price. I just wished the GLK was out then. Owning mostly GM vehicles, my deciding factor was the availability of Teleaid. It's like power windows, once you have it you never go back. There are so many things to love about this vehicle, especially the ride. After driving the C Class, I'm amazed that they are even relatives. I averaged 21.8 mpg today on a 257 mile trip, with a 1600 ft climb (love the altimiter), head winds and averaging 70 to 80 mph. My 24 mile city loop to work averages 19. I don't think that is bad for 2 tons of fun! Biggest Gripe: No A/T tires available for 19's on a AWD."
car_3749,I LOVE my 2015 GLK 350 4 Matic,"I do wish it had heated seats. Although, I competed a lot of research, I didn't  realize my truck didn't come with heated seats."
car_3750,so far so good,Bought this low mileage GLK 4Matic and have driven for a month including 900 mile trip. Car is very quiet and accelerates well. Only problem so far was a dead battery in a proximity key. Navigation and audio system are a challenge to understand basic issues like setting radio presets without breaking out the manual.
car_3751,Great Mini SUV,"We've had our GLK for 5 months now and love it!  Our other vehicle is a Land Rover LR3 (also an amazing vehicle!!), so we didn't need another large SUV, but still loved the practicality of a SUV design.  The GLK replaced our 2004 Lexus RX330.  Don't let the GLK's timid design fool you.  The 302HP and German suspension makes this car fun to drive.  It's main CON would be the rear seat space and storage space.  Another four inches would have made a huge improvement.  I have not experienced any of the wind noise that some complain about.  Overall, very happy with our purchase."
car_3752,"Faulty Traction Control (ESP), Loses Power on Road","The ""esp inoperative"" message pops up frequently,"
car_3753,Smooth Operator,"I recently purchased the 2015 Mercedes GLK350 2WD and it's a great SUV. It has a smooth ride and handles the road quite nicely.  I have not noticed the wind noise that others have referred too so I will give that some time. My vehicle came fully loaded with Navigation, Blue tooth, Command; the works. The gas mileage is the icing on the cake as 'm seeing about 22 miles per gallon using the ECO option. All in all, I don't have any regrets in purchasing this beauty."
car_3754,GREAT CAR ONLY THING NOT GREAT IS SMALL BACKSEAT,"GREAT CAR AT GREAT PRICE AFTER 3 WEEKS SHOPPING,SAVED MORE THAN $3000 WITH ONLINE SALES!!"
car_3755,Awesome car for a great price!,"I got this car as a demo car with almost 8,000 miles for a great price. The car has a lot of space and it looks very nice."
car_3756,"Smoth ride, wind noise, slow rain wiper","This car ride very smoothly, but like the other reviewer, my GLK350 also has wind noise. And it's always in the passenger front side. I took it in to the dealer and they had the window shield replaced.  The situation still not improved.  I didn't hear that noise when I drove Avalon or any other verticals.  It was raining really hard today and my rain wipers weren't fast enough for me to see the road, this were never happen in my past  with the other cars. I will not buy this car again.* Correction:  Dealer replaced windshield seal at first (did not work). Finally they replaced the front windshield glass, that got rid of the annoying wind noise."
car_3757,Wind sound,"I love my car with two exceptions. There is a constant wind sound inside the vehicle. I took it to be repaired and they advised this a design problem with the vehicle. Told they all sound like this. ""It's normal"". Also disappointed in the gas mileage performance."
car_3758,"Best in class SUV, elegant and great handling","Best in class SUV, elegant and great handling"
car_3759,THE GLK 350 MYTH- EDITH,"This is a great car until you become familiar with it. It has looks,style and attractiveness,but the pros generally stop there. None of the controls are intuitive. The voice commands only control the nav system. My 2014 Honda Accord Touring could make calls,turn on the air,   ch ange the temperature and several other things. This car is luxury in name only,because it has the Mercedes name tag. In my personal opinion, the cost to value ratio is about 75%. I would not buy this vehicle again"
car_3760,2015 glk250 bluetech,Great close out deal.  Msrp was 49925.  Left dealer at 40k even.   I liked the glk navigation better than the new one that looks like it was added on.  Car is flawless.  I've yet to do the first service but so far we love it. Replaced a Cadillac SRX
car_3761,Buyer beware!,"Pros: I love the feel of this car when driving. It's solid with great acceleration. I also like the fact that you can put the car into the ""hold"" position (while stopped at a light for example) and the car will temporarily cut off theoretically saving on gas. Once you put your foot on the accelerator it kicks back into drive seamlessly. It's a quality made vehicle, and overall the drive and performance is great. Cons:  For several years, I drove a BMW X5 and a Lexus RX350 before purchasing this vehicle. As one reviewer mentioned, it took concentrated maneuvering to get either the Beemer and Lexus into my garage because of their larger size.  I bought the GLK thinking it was marginally smaller and therefore not as much trouble to get in and out of the garage. It took a while to notice that it's not just marginally smaller, its tremendously smaller than either the Beemer or the Lexus. In fact, the interior room is so much smaller that I sometime have trouble getting in and out. The leg room in the backseat is a joke. My son is only 5'10"", but I had to move all the seats forward when bringing him home after surgery. I couldn't get his size 11 feet into the back comfortably. Not only is there insufficient leg room, but theres no room to just put ""stuff"". You know- stuff - like things you would normally keep in your glove compartment besides the owner manual. Forget it. This is the smallest glove compartment I've ever seen. The owners manual barely fits. If you have other ""stuff"" to put there you'd better think of something else. Don't expect to have room in the side pockets or the pockets on the back of the seats either - almost non-existent. The armrest in the middle has some room but not by much.I'm on the road a lot. While I drive I like to listen to audio books via my Iphone. I expect the bluetooth to pick up the book as soon as I get into the car. That's the way it worked on the previous two vehicles. Not with the GLK. Sometimes my book starts automatically. Sometimes it doesn't. It drives me crazy when I'm on a long stretch of highway and lose the signal. That's happened more than a few times. Driving and trying to manipulate the small letters (I wear reading glasses and can't see as well as I used to) on the dashboard or with the little ""wheel"" to try to reconnect bluetooth isn't always easy. Just trying to see whether I'm pushing the Navi, Radio, Disc button is beyond my vision and graphics be damned they are not all that intuitive. It's been a year since I purchased the vehicle. It has less than 6K miles on it. As I now contemplate trading it in, I've found that the value of the car has dropped by at least 35% after only a year. I got 60% on trade for my Lexus - after 5 years!  Turns out the GLK doesn't hold it's value.  I'm disappointed in that, but you live and learn. Overall, the GLK drives smoothly, accelerates quickly but buyer beware theres a lot of little annoyances that may not make it worth the initial high cost."
car_3762,"GLK is getting better with age, We love it.","Adding back up camera is expensive if you want it integrate with screen in car.We are pleased with the car. Performance and handling has improved with the miles driven. Annual service is a bit costly, but much more service performed than on GM cars I have owned."
car_3763,My little run around SUV,"I love the size of this vehicle! I spend thousands of miles on the road in my car each year and I feel safe and comfy in this car like SUV. My husband loves to drive it! Its diesel and I have (after 16k) miles been averaging 37-45 miles per gallon. The seats are still pretty firm and hard, and after 26k miles still not as comfy as I had hoped. The navigation system is not very intuitive and a bit cumbersome to operate...time consuming actually. I do not live in the city so once I go off a paved road its essentially useless to me. This is a huge problem in rural areas. Had I known this prior to purchase I would not have bought this car. You must be stopped to enter data which can be a problem if you're already lost in a dicey area! In rural areas where I frequently travel, the turn by turn directions are non-existent. Diesel engine is quite a bit noisier than Toureg Diesel I previously owned. I have not been able to get the voice command training working so I can accept calls or enter directions verbally.  Overall, this is a nice car and perfect for my needs, very responsive on curvy roads and mountains. Not terribly sure footed in heavy snow. Lots of light, large windshield and sunroof. The rear seats lay down nicely for larger cargo area and perfect for taking dogs along.  Nice visibility overall.  I am kind of surprised that I need new brakes already as my other cars went many more miles before needing any attention."
car_3764,It was such a good lease deal with took two!,"After 5 volvos between the 2 of us, and a Land Rover, VW and Honda in between and with Volvo's reluctance to negotiate their high leases, the MB 2015 GLK AWD was not only refreshing but the most luxurious riding vehicle we have owned to date!  Edmunds is right, this car is solid, over 4,000 pounds in weight, holds the road and with an an engine you cannot hear.  The acceleration has no turbo lag and we are spoiled with the quiet, smooth ride and the engine's effortless changing of gears we cannot hear or feel it.  (Take that volvo and VW)  I am 6'1 215 male athletic build, front seats are comfy, head room we love, harder to find cars with expansive head room.   The AWD will be much appreciated in the harsh Minnesota winters.  The safety mechanisms are second to none.  Plus knee airbags for the driver!  The 19 inch tires plant you firmly on the pavement but don't be fooled, this baby can get up and GO!  We are in love with the engine's power for highway driving.  Truly this is luxury at its best.  Volvo's are nice, but Benz is superb!   The best thing about both our 2015 GLK's are the lease rates.  MB leases it's demo's (take note Volvo, thank you for rejecting my off on your 2015 Volvo xc70 demo which after my offer sat on the lot for 3 months!)  My GLK is red, black leather no sunroof or manual gate but everything else. $329 month 2 year lease 7500 a year (yeah we dont' drive much)  My partner, 2015 GLK white, tan leather, wood dash, dual sunroof and power gate $350 a month 2 year lease 7500 a year.  It was $3k down on EACH vehicle, hefty, but leasing costs.We look forward to the redesign and re badging the 2016 GLC and look forward to a long long long relationship with MB.  (take that Volvo!)"
car_3765,So Far So Good....,"We have 7000 miles on our 2015 GLK350 now and so far it's been outstanding. Mercedes quality is evident in this car with no squeaks, rattles, even on the bumpiest of roads. Engine is powerful for its class. The Eco mode where the engine shuts off after a minute at lights is a great invention. Just lift off the brake pedal and it instantly starts back up with no lag time. My only complaint is that the engine has a slightly rattly sound that reminds me a bit of a diesel, but that's really nit picking at this point. Transmission is seamless, almost electric engine smooth! Interior is outstandingly sharp. My wife picked this car at the dealership for this feature. Very tastefully done (we got the dark wood with aluminium trim). Despite our toddler flinging his milk bottles and turning the back of the car into a white splattered version of a murder scene, everything simply wiped off with a wet rag. Seats are comfy yet firm. The suspension is a bit more firm than I prefer but I also appreciate the confidence the firmness inspires. Definitely more sports car feeling than an SUV (evident in it's shared C-Class platform). Now the gripes: - During a rain storm, you're sure to get a bit of a drenching when you open the back doors. The rear rain gutters are ineffective. - The turn signal stalk is always hidden behind the main stalk so you're accidentally turning on the wipers instead of the blinker. - For such a wide vehicle, it sure has little interior space. Our E-Class wagon is narrower yet holds 3 to 4 times as much stuff! Overall, we love this car. It's my wife's main car while I drive our E-Class Wagon. Both cars feel very different and it's hard to tell which one I prefer...."
car_3766,Solid little trucklette,"I wanted a vehicle that was small enough to fit in my garage, has strong towing capability for its size, can handle snow and some dirt roads.  The GLK250 was at the high end of the price range I was considering, but the build quality reflects the price.  Great seats, great engine, great transmission.  Minus points:  Small cargo area (but if the vehicle was longer it wouldn't fit in my garage).  Upright windshield results in a bit of wind noise.  Handling feels ""heavy"" at first but you get used to it and at German-type highway speeds (above 80 mph) it seems tuned just right."
car_3767,"Great Car , Better than expected","This car has exceeded my expectations. It looks so much better in person, than in the pics. This car turns heads. The car drives smoothly and is quiet. Steering feel is ok. Rides over pot holes well. Mine is fully loaded. I love it. The car feels bullet proof, and extremely well built. Everything so far works beautifully. The phone bluetooth sync took some time to get setup (Hint: Remove the space in your phone ID) and I synced my phonebook by sending vcard info. Multimedia package is a must have. Lighting Package is amazing for the money. I have the leather package, its worth the extra in my opinion. I wasn't a fan of the MBTEX. This is my first Mercedes. I can see why they are so desirable."
car_3768,Small SUV reviewed by father of 2,"Just traded in a Audi Q7 on 01/16/09 after a HORRIBLE experience and picked up the GLK, same day. Looking to downsize, we felt the GLK was a solid choice. Overall, like the look but downsizing, I will have to get used to a small interior. Cargo area is very small. Rear seats are tight for adults. The structure feels VERY solid. 4matic is good in snow but seems to bind up in tight turns on dry roads. So far 2216 miles and its returning 13.1MPG city and 18.7 highway. In other words very thirsty. COMMAND sys is NOT user friendly. Rear view camera is great, ditto for sound sys. Last week though, it was repaired due to a faulty brake system and front rotors were replaced along with hard drive."
car_3769,Best car so far!,"Recently traded in my 2 year old Infiniti G35 (which I loved) -- just not a convenient car to shuttle our 5 & 6 year old around.  First Benz for our family.  So far I absolutely love it.  I thought I'd miss the power performance of the G (which I do a little), but this truck is surprisingly nimble -- much more than the Acura MDX my wife drives.  The build quality & solid feel is absolutely exceptional -- better than any car I've driven.  On the road, it drives remarkably similar to a sedan (albeit with the comfortable feeling of sitting up higher)."
car_3770,"great feel,looks,and handling","After driving a n sl550for 2 1/2 yrs. Its a lot roomier to say the least. After my test drive I knew I had to get one. The drive was awesome, takes corners like a champ, seating is very comfortable. The 268 hp engine is the same one that was in my slk 350 several yrs. Ago. Its quiet and has a lot of get up & go. Proforms well. I now can get several sets of golf clubs in the cargo area. I tested all the small suv's, this is definatly the best."
car_3771,One month in a GLK,"Traded in our BMW X3. Overall, the GLK is a better SUV. It holds more cargo, has good power and never feels heavy. The biggest problem to report has to do with electronic problems- from the power seats to the rear latch to the A/C controls which shorted out. Already needed additional oil and the system check light alerted us of engine/EC problems. Build quality is low to average.  The COMAND info system is good but not great:the knob is placed in a very odd position behind shifter. Why? The brakes are soft and fade from highway speeds. It needs premium gas and at 14.1 MPG average, it needs plenty of gas. There is no place for cell phones- only in small cup holders. Little back seat room."
car_3772,Best car ever,"I previously owned a 2000 ML class, its the worst car i think i have ever had. But i decided to give Mercedes another shot. I bought this new GLK class being a little hesitant at first, criticizing every little flaw. I ended up buying it and I don't regret it one bit. Best car i have driven in ages."
car_3773,Issue with brakes,"A Mercedes through and through, except the brakes. Same platform as the C class sedan and apparently same brakes which are not strong enough. Have to pump them once to get them to grab like they should.  Dealership said they've had similar complaints and MB is working on a resolution. They better do it quickly - braking is very below average and possibly dangerous."
car_3774,2010 GLK,"This is an awesome car.  I traded my 2007 GL 450 on this car in January 2009. We live in Chicago and this car is far better for city driving.  This car is head and shoulders above everything else in the class and, in my opinion, many larger SUVs. Very maneuverable, great seating position and views all around.  Acceleration is solid, but the chassis is amazing. As the Edmunds reviewers noted, this car is as solid as a brick. It inspires lots of confidence in all driving situations.   Surprisingly good in the snow, even with the 20"" wheels. The C- Class Nav/Audio system is much better than the older system in my GL. HK Sound is superb and the rear seat DVD system is much improved."
car_3775,Best car I ever owned,"I picked up my car on 1/12/2009. I have been a Mercedes owner for about 10 years. This by far is the best Mercedes ever built. It runs fantastic, it is tight and floats on air type of ride. The car itself was well worth the money I paid and getting a 2010 so early was great as I have a big jump before depreciation sets in."
car_3776,GLC– disappointment,"We have all the numbers Mercedes over the years and decided to get the GLC versus the GLK due to it being discontinued.  We were one of the first buyers in the Denver market and had to wait for it to be shipped from Germany. Unfortunately I did not use my, do not buy the first year of the model, when buying this vehicle. We have not only had poor service from the dealership in trying to determine a problem but are having continual transmission issues which now need to be resolved through Germany. This is the second time we have brought this vehicle in for the same issue. The service technicians tell us that they have had numerous complaints for the same issue that have gone un resolved. There is a potential Lemon law in Colorado that may also be enacted on this vehicle. With a number of vehicles in the same class. Audi, and BMW. I feel I did not make a good buying decision."
car_3777,Great Car but somewhat un-Mercedes,"I've driven Mercedes 30 years. I have had 300E, E300, S500, and C320. But I needed high seats and an ease of entry/exit for my bad back. So, I got a GLC300.  Well, well! While the ride is Mercedes like, suspension is awful. It jerks, bobs, bounces, vibrates, and wiggles. Some vibration is very unpleasant frequency.  There're other issues too.  My tires went bald at 20.5K miles. What happened? Well, a simple accounting trick. MB installs run-flat tires but doesn't include a spare and installation kit. It saves MB money but at the expense of the buyers replacing tires 3 times faster.  So, after 1 year of service I spent $1400 on Michelins and must buy a spare kit (from MB, of course) for $800.  There! Didn't expect this from MB."
car_3778,Beauty is empty inside!!!,"Does not come with anything, no keyless go on standard model.  You have to have a key to open the door, no touch open and go.  After 5.5 months of driving the air condition have mildew smell and the trunk sealer at bottom fall apart.  The monitor is not touch control, issue with blue tooth connection."
car_3779,"Owed for 6 months, and then discover the SUV Volvo","At 1st the performance was ok. After a time it lacked behind in agility and performance. Followed a speedy Volvo SUV going down the mountain where I live, and could not keep up with it. Test drove Volvo and found out why. Bought Volvo and glad I did. The styling is also so much better and special. The Benz was boring."
car_3780,Thumping Noise in Front End,"Started at about 5000 miles. Dealer rotated tires. Still thumping. Dealer said tires were feathered, needs alignment. Brought car in for alignment but was told car needed new front and rear differentials. Differentials installed 2 weeks later. Thumping has been significantly reduced. I asked for alignment to eliminate that as an issue. I was charged $150 for what should have been a warranty repair. I was told car needed new tires at 13,000 miles--typical of run-flats??This problem, coupled with the screeching brake issue previously reported, has made owning this otherwise fine vehicle a headache."
car_3781,No bluetooth!,"Unless u buy the navigation package, u will be stuck like us, with a 45k car that does NOT have bluetooth. Nobody told us until after delivery. Would not have bought the car. Really Mercedes Benz....really????"
car_3782,Pimp Car,"If you don't take out of the city it might work for you. I traded in my GLK350 and I loved it. Just getting up in the miles. It came with run flat tires , no spare and no jack. The tires came with a warning saying that they've were not safe in temperatures under 45 degrees! I had of course purchased this vehicle with a 4 magic so I could use it for winter driving with all season tires.  My travel out of town is all 200-300 miles and in desolate areas with no cell service or road service which means that a flat tire could be life threatening in summer or winter weather. Run flat tires are not stocked anywhere close and can not be repaired so better use it for pimp work in the big city. The dealer and MB are of no help at all. Can't by a jack or a spare for this vehicle. So if you're looking for a safe car look elsewhere. It is also noisy and bouncy. Not a Mercedes by any standard I'm aware off. You'll also need to study the manual as there is nothing intuitive about anything on this car. Don't be tempted by the styling."
car_3783,MY Mercedes is an embarrassment,The brakes screech when backing up. They are so loud that the neighbors don't want us to pull out early morning or evening. People complain we wake babies and make dogs bark. Dealership has been saying for months that Germany is working on a fix and parts are coming. Its been over six months no one call us back anymore. They did mention it is Motor Trends Car of the Year and they can't keep them in stock. Question... should they be selling them knowing this is a serious issues?!!!
car_3784,Great SUV alternative to X3 and Q5 - worth a look!,"I've had my '16 GLC300 for almost a year.  I bought it CPO from Mercedes Benz Palm Beach and had an excellent experience overall with a fantastic extended warranty.  I am nearing my year 1 visit (service A) with 8,000 on it and have absolutely NO complaints or issues.  This is my first luxury brand purchase, having always owned more practical cars (Honda, Nissan, Mazda, etc.) and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I love the handling, steering, acceleration, highway handling, ride in general, fuel economy.  My friends are all envious of my vehicle and a very reasonable purchase price for a Mercedes.  I have friends who are long time MB loyalists and I now can finally understand why!  Thanks, MB - I am a new lifetime member.  Thanks for making vehicles that are meant to be enjoyed and driven!  Kudos to MB Palm Beach for making the experience outstanding!"
car_3785,Brakes sound like nails on a chalkboard!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy or lease this vehicle until Mercedes figures out the deafening brake screeching issue.  (This happens when backing up the vehicle mostly, then over time when driving forward and braking as well). The dealer makes excuses but it's basically good luck sucker!!  The whole neighborhood knows when you're backing out of the garage.  Very rough ride.  I hate the suspension.  Poor example of an SUV, I think it's more of a crossover. I would take my Toyota 4Runner back in 3 seconds.  Garage door opener works when it wants to, but only at close range.   Good on gas, good acceleration, great leg room for driver and front seat passenger, I must say.  Can't find a comfortable headrest position.  Most important, my engine light has been on for a week.  The only reason the dealer HAD to take it in and give me a loner car, which I am in love with!  A 2017 GLE 350....love it.  It's what I expect from Mercedes, and an SUV.  Hoping for a solution soon."
car_3786,We too have the noisey brakes in reverse.,Great car.  Quite.  Interior is first rate.  Ride is nicely flexible with program.  Don't understand the squeak in the brakes in reverse.
car_3787,Break Noise,This GLS 300 is best in performance and comfort. But it has a loud noise when taking reverse and applying the breaks. I agree with other reviewers that this loud squeaky noise is definitely an embarrassment for owning this vehicle !!!!  Mercedes with their reputation need to fix this ASAP.
car_3788,Brake issue resolved!!,"The loud brake squeal has been resolved after MB replaced the brake pads (under warranty).  I have owned my GLC for over a year now and can't say anything bad about it (now that the brake squeal is gone).  Love that it still gives 30MPG on highway, has a very good acceleration, comfy seats, posh interior. Took 3 long trips to NY/NJ in the past year and loved driving 5+ hours.  Passenger seat probably should lean back more as sometimes our toddler's head falls forward when napping."
car_3789,Screeching Brakes - buyers beware,"Cold weather locales will no doubt find screeching brake issues. Manufacturer is aware and even though it existed in the 2016 models, the fix still eludes their engineers in the 2017 models. Neighbors hate us and it's forcing me to attempt less braking while backing out of my shared (and loooong) driveway. Take away this  issue and this car would be near perfect. Yes, controls are clunky but it can grow on you."
car_3790,MB should be embarrassed - 6 mos old and regret!,"This is my first and likely my last MB! I did the research and ultimately decided on the GLC 4MATIC SUV  (BMW X3 , Acura RDX and Audi Q5 were closely considered).  The smooth ride, MB reputation, customer service (boy was I wrong!) and safety record sealed my decision.  At 6 mos. old and only 3K miles on my car, the SCREECHING brakes are SO incredibly loud that I have switched cars with my husband.  The brakes wake my young daughter up from a sound sleep as I am backing out of the garage in the morning.  My neighbors and colleagues have asked multiple times, ""What is wrong with your brand new car?""  This is not a small squeak, but a screech that turns peoples heads!  This is evidently a known problem to MB and they have no solution to date.  My car is currently at the dealership for a 'temporary fix', which the service manager admitted will only put a brief bandaid on a larger problem that MB has yet to formally acknowledge to its high paying customers.  No letter from MB.  No phone call.  No email.  Nothing.  Just me calling and complaining, with the dealership ultimately putting me on a waiting list for several weeks to have a temporary fix implemented.  Sorry MB, but this lack of acknowledgement of a problem and disrespect is not going to earn you my loyalty.  How do I know if the car is even safe to drive?  MB - I'm very disappointed.  I've waited a long time to purchase a brand new car that I've worked very hard for.  Potential customers be warned and go with another option IMHO."
car_3791,Major brake issues no replacement parts for months,"Deafening brake screech!  Not a squeak or squeal, but a screech.  Has been an issue for months, dealer says no parts for 2 more months"
car_3792,Great car,"I grew up with parent that always bout top of the line Lincolns but I have 3 kid and needed something larger. So, for the last 20 years we have purchased top of the line Honda or Toyota vans. Now we have 2 in college and one at home so we wanted to down size our primary vehicle and decided on the size class the GLC is in. We did our research...read the reviews and narrowed our search to the Lexus, Acura, Audi and Mercedes. We started test driving the cars in our list and really like the Audi Q5 until we drove the GLC. I know everyone's buying criteria and expectations are different so here are our deciding factors. Comfortable ride because we take a lot of trips over 4 hours. Safety features. Entertainment system that includes Satellite radio. Limited Blind spots. Performance. And, if my two oldest sons had to ride in the car and we comfortable considering they are 6' plus and have size 14 shoes."
car_3793,Small flaws kill the experience- updated new issue,My previous reviews was on the experience.  I have had the car since April 2016 and now I had my first dealership visit after 13K miles.  Computer malfunction left would not allow the car to start.  After 30 minutes it finally started but had a few warning lights on.  Sensors go off for no reason.  Rear seat belt got locked inside wall.  There is no restraint to have the seatbelt buckle from getting swallowed.  Waited many years to purchase my luxury vehicle.  Love the car hate some of the features that kill the perfect experience.  When Sunroof and/or windows are open there is a lot of noise.  Can not drive more than 40 mph with Sunroof open.  Wish the car had a little more height.  Mouse is so annoying and it burns your wrist on very hot days.  Garage door opener only works when it wants. I now have to carry my old remote control.
car_3794,Great CUV/SUV,"My GLC300 is the 2017 model and this car is by far the best value in its class especially compared to Lexus 350, Audi Q5, Infiniti F35, & Volvo XC60.  Pros: Smooth ride, nice handling and feels sporty especially with dynamic controls, roomy interior including decent backseat legroom for growing children, like the parking break option while waiting at light/traffic, good value for standard features and packages. moon roof is a great option,  gas mileage and safety features a plus, and spacious cargo area.  Cons:  Infotainment system controls are ridiculously confusing and cumbersome,  too many repetative knobs and features,  if main screen was touchscreen it would make it much easier.  Shifter, wipers, lights, & steering wheel adjustment are all on the steering column which takes a little getting used to and it sometimes feels a little clunky when accelerating from a dead stop.  Overall,  pros outweigh the cons and it is a nice looking vehicle."
car_3795,Love IT,I also shopped all of the luxury SUV brands.  What sold me was the interior and the comfort of the seating.My passengers have remarked that the backseat is the most comfortable they have ever sat in.   Very smooth ride and ease to park.    Very satisfied so far.
car_3796,Very nice package,"I have absolutely no complaints! Great interior  and technology package! Shopped Porsche Macan, BMW, Audi Q5. Mercedes gives you a lot of car for the price! I simply was not willing to spend over $55000!"
car_3797,I expected a lot - but - a huge disapointment,"I really wanted to love this GLC. On paper, it looked perfect. Ive owned 5 previous Mercedes and expected it to be a modern state of art design with traditional MB quality and driving dynamics.  I custom ordered it and waited several months for delivery. The similar designed C300 sedan loaned me while awaiting delivery was a fantastic vehicle. It does has a lot of great features; classy design, great looking interior, a refined strong drivetrain, high overall quality. BUT..... This vehicle has SEVERE driving flaws, terrible controls and layout, the worst NAV/audio/infotainment system Ive ever experienced in any vehicle [and had the priviledge of paying $4K extra for]. These flaws have ruined the ownership experience for us.   On smooth roads, it drives and handles fine. On certain rough surfaces, the car shakes, rocks, shudders, bottoms out,  and feels like the front suspension or front frame is loose and disconnected from the road . Scary and unsafe to drive. I NEVER expected this in a Benz since all previous ones had a "" locked down"" driving quality on poor road surfaces. I dont know [or care] if this is result of bad tuning, run flat tires, or a flaw in this particular GLC....but its scary and unsafe to drive on rough roads. The wiper/wheel adjustment/cruise stalk controls and transmission shifter are all on the steering column, all milimeters apart from each other causing you to activate the wrong feature. Who thought of this confusing lever layout and what were they thinking ? The NAV/audio features and controls seem thought up by tweens that never...well ever used them in a moving vehicle. The IPad style screen stuck in the middle of the dash looks tacky and PepBoys classless,  voice controls rarely work reliably, the radio has no ability to seek/scan stations, the double wheel/touchpad controller on console interfere with each other [Hans, marketing says we MUST have a touch entry because Audi does, I dont care how you do it, stick it on top of the control wheel !] making sure you never select the right control on the first try, NAV system has a great display but takes 5 minutes to tap & dial, tap and dial an address....excuse me, this is 2016 where flawless Google voice entry is the design standard, who is going to take the time to use that ? Mercedes carefully dances around the subject of CarPlay and Android Auto in the GLC..but after a long conversation with MB helpline they admitted.....you guessed it...not availabe and not upgradeable for the GLC.  The bad features overwhelm the good features in the GLC .... a real shame in what could have been ..but isnt...a great vehicle."
car_3798,I finally found THE PERFECT CAR,"I am a Honda and Subaru owner who usually keeps her cars for 15 years. Those brands are not known for having impressive interiors, but the cars ran great, were reliable and had good resale. When it was time for a new car I spent 3 years looking for a car that was a little higher than a sedan and had some cargo room, but was also not too big, was super comfy and handled great. I could not find that car at Honda or Subaru. I did however find it at Mercedes Benz. The GLC300 embodies all of those qualities and then some. If you want a car that feels like it was made for you, that makes you look forward to driving, then you have found it in the GLC300. The cabin is quiet, the seats are great, the multimedia is second to none (get the larger 8.4 inch screen), the Burmester is the best sounding factory audio in this price point, the handling of this car is dreamy, it has great acceleration. I guess the only negative about this car is that it's not a Honda or a Subaru with proven reliability or resale value. But since Honda and Subaru refuse to make comfortable, luxurious vehicles with great tech, audio and handling, it's MB for me for the next 15 years."
car_3799,2017 GLC - Excellent Mid Size SUV,"The new 2016/2017 Mercedes GLC is very refined, smooth, quiet and has a lot of technology.   The ride is great and materials are top notch in the interior.  Acceleration is very good for its class and handling is pretty good.   I would consider it at or near the top of its class compared to BMW X3, Jaguar F Pace, Acura RDX, etc.  Price is competitive."
car_3800,hertzdav,My collision avoidance system is not working. Took it back to the dealer and they don't have a clue as how to even test it. I called Mercedes Hq and they supposedly have advised my dealer how to insure the system is working properly. Tomorrow we try again. If they don't repair it I will Lemmon law the vehicle. Dealer still can't get the collision avoidance working. Very disappointing! I love the car and have taken it back for the collision avoidance system 3 times. It still doesn't work. One more engineering mistake is with the drivers side windshield wiper. If you lift the wiper up it comes in contact with the hood and scratches the paint off the hood. They have no fix for that.
car_3801,Love this car!,"I really enjoy the ride and how my GLC drives but I am going to highlight a few nits for those considering this model. This is my first Mercedes so I did have to get used to the multimedia/nav controls which are a bit less intuitive that my old 2007 Acura RDX. While the 9 speed auto transmission is very efficient, I personally think it does not downshift enough when slowing for a rolling turn at an intersection. This can lead to either a soft acceleration or a light jump as you hit the gas to make your turn. As I pull up to a Stop sign, the transmission can still be in D5 even when the speedometer reads 10-15 mph. There is no issue starting with good acceleration from full stop, though. The USB ports for charging my iPhone are great and I like how they are both hidden and accessible. However, pausing my music player also seems to silence any vocal queues from Google Maps or Waze. If I have the music playing, then the vocal queues work over the bluetooth but I have to have both or neither.  This might be human error, though I have tried to figure it out."
car_3802,"Some great,, some terrible","I have a love hate relationship wth this car... It has a great,comfortable ride,the mileage is great ,the is plenty of power ,the mechanical aspects good...my big complaint is that the controls on this car are terrible. The controls are very poor designed and hard to use. The mbrace is no substitute for onstar."
car_3803,Love my new GLC,This is my first Mercedes and it is a v good small SUV. I love it except for the computer. The controls are awkward. The screen is propped on the dashboard and it is strange. I wish it was built in.
car_3804,Surprisingly fun little SUV,Surprised just how much we really like this SUV.   For the price of the navigation it really should have Apple play and not rely on an old-school CD system.   Speaker upgrade panoramic roof and rear camera where worthwhile oprions.   The panoramic roof that's in so much light that it makes the cabin a nice place to be.
car_3805,Father's day Gift,"Just got it as Father's Day gift. Only drove 75 miles (mostly on high way at 70 mph) so far.  Got 33 mpg on high way. My old ML got 20 mpg, my BMW X5 got 26 mpg on high way. I've never driven a car having this high gas mileage before, not even a sedan. No complaint here. V4 with 241 hp is still very powerful. Competiters: X3, Q5, RX, MKX, XT5, RDX, QX50 and Macan."
car_3806,great car/suv,worth the money
car_3807,So far so great!,"Have had the GLC about 3 months and have about 2000 miles on it.  It does everything it is designed to do.  It is a pleasant place to sit in in traffic and move about town, but can quickly change character if you wish.  Just downshift with the paddles or change the driving mode.  Mileage has been decent considering my mostly city/traffic driving (about 23.5 mpg).  Like BMW, the GLC shuts off the engine if you  are stopped for a few seconds.  Since the car is so quiet I do not notice this, and so I think it helps with some of that city mpg.  My friend who just got a BMW X1 turns off the auto shut off because he says it's annoying.  Possibly because BMW wants you to hear the engine - so I can see what he means.  My only quibbles are things I knew about the car before I got it - getting in and out takes a little bit of effort, unlike my old RAV 4 which was so easy.  However, the GLC seat is incredibly comfortable.  Rearview from the side mirrors are only so-so, but the Blind Spot Monitor takes care of that.  The Burmester stereo is great, but I would recommend using .wav files which are uncompressed.  The 2 USB ports, the SD card, and the 10.8 GB harddrive mean that there is about 200 GB of storage (64 GB max for USBs and SD) - so that's approx. the equivalent of 20 GB of compressed music.  The difference in sound is worth it to me (e.g., Lexus does not play .wav files through the USB; BMW does, though).  The active safety feature of warning/stopping the car if you get too close really works.  It does, however, beep at me when the car in front of me is almost finished making a right turn and I have not braked.  Better safe than sorry, I suppose.As far as all the buttons, etc., I found that after a few days I easily got used to it.  Still finding some neat little tricks here and there.Another thing I really like about this car is how MB packaged the options.  I got everything I wanted and did not have to pay for the things I did not want (e.g., sunroof), compared to BMW, say.  Also, I got a pretty good deal, about 9% off MSRP at the end of January."
car_3808,Small Luxury SUV that Lives up to its Name!,"Finally...been shopping all the small luxury SUVS and this one REALLY lives up to the word luxury!  I tried the Lexus NX for a year...I'm sorry...noisy, cheap plastics everywhere.  It seemed more like a $30k SUV, and not the $45k sticker price.  The MB was a bit more, but it has REAL leather, better acceleration and sporting feel, and luxury feeling materials all over the vehicle.  I've only had the GLC a month, but it is far above the NX in terms of luxury feel and performance."
car_3809,Great Compact SUV,Overall very nice. Would have been great with a touch screen or easier user interlace for the  Tech.
car_3810,Love this SUV.,"Really love this car. Comfortable, quiet, great sound system, and really great gas mileage. On the freeway I can get 29 miles per gallon and around town getting 21+.  The mouse is somewhat antiquated but easy to use - I would prefer a touch screen. Love the turbo which allows great acceleration entering the freeway."
car_3811,TOO  expensive,Very expensive SUV for what it cut out very little technology for the price.  No adaptive cruise control standard Comes as bery extra very expensive to be able have  adaptive Cruise control of your highway driver did not recommend this SUV.
car_3812,A+ Mercedes,"Looked at BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan. All were excellent automobiles. I choose the GLC because it stood out in all the right ways price, options, style and build quality. My advice is not to skimp on some of those options that make owning a car like this pleasurable."
car_3813,Not quite what I expected from a Mercedes,Not quite what I expected from a Mercedes
car_3814,Class act,The GLC is nearly perfect in every way. There's just to many great things to say about this car. Drive one and I'm confident you'll want to buy one.
car_3815,GLC 300 Good Value,"Chose between a GLC 300, BMW X3, Land Rover Discovery.  GLC 300 seemed to have more extras than the X3 and Discovery that were pumping up their price. For example, the BMW with a sunroof was only available if I bought one with a bunch of premium stuff that I didn't need, putting it out of my budget. TRAILER HITCH IS NOT AVAILABLE AS OF 3/8/16 SO IF YOU NEED A HITCH BUY AN X3 or Discovery. This is on Edmunds and MB of San Diego dealer  said, ""No problem, we don't have a vehicle with one in stock, but you can just get one put on after you buy the car."" He didn't say that they weren't available right now. It's been over a month and no trailer hitch is available.Now I have to go rent a handicapped accessible ramp van so I can move my daughter and her power wheelchair around when she comes home for spring break since I have no trailer hitch to attach a trailer. Not sure if I'll ever have one."
car_3816,MB for Marlon Brando,I love this car
car_3817,Disappointed,"My first Mercedes. I expected more and better technology. The mouse pad and control are difficult to use. A touchscreen would be 100 times better. Navigation is extremely difficult to set up an address. Panoramic sunroof wind noise is so bad we do not use it. Front and rear cameras have limited view range. Sensors do not sound until you are right on an object. Accustomed to General Motors and Chrysler where rear camera range extends up and down the street when in reverse. Sensors also sound when another vehicle approaches; not the GLC300. Ride and handling are very good. Not so performance. Dealer, Cutler Bay, Florida, very bad in explaining accessories and technology. Pushed Lojack when MBrace (included with the vehicle) does the same thing in more areas of the country. I would not buy another vehicle from them or suggest the dealership to another person."
car_3818,"Quality Issues, rides very rough","Ride is responsive but rough.   Quality issues:  back seat did not fold, washer fluid froze first week,  very loud squeal in front tire,  mbrace remote start only works periodically."
car_3819,Peerless GLC (Compared with BWM X3 and Audi Q5),Peerless GLC (Compared with BWM X3 and Audi Q5)
car_3820,Great luxury SUV with some minor refinement issues,"Overall it's a great vehicle.  The price can quickly go up depending on options selected.  And in order to get certain options, you must select another package which increases the price further.  Plenty of features, but surprised that a few aren't even standard considering it's 2016.  Features such as keyless entry (MB calls it keyless go) and any color other than white or black is still an added cost option.  Most models in dealership comes with the high end stereo system, panoramic sunroof, heated seat, which add to the cost but not providing a lot of value for certain region.  You must special order in order to get close to what you want.The quality is good and design is nice.  A few trim pieces felt cheap because of plastic feel.  The ergonomic is poor, but that's typical German where common logic isn't a high priority on their design.  The center console with the touch pad and wheel is over complicated and difficult to use, a lesson they need to learn from the Japanese, or take a page from Apple in design.  The gear shift located on the column is awkward to use.  And then the turn signal, lights, front & rear wiper, and washer are all located on one stalk on the left hand side along with another two stalks for cruise control and steering wheel adjustment as well as the paddle shift.  The steering wheel already have many buttons.  I think it's overly complex and not very user friendly.So far during the first month of ownership, a couple issues creep up already.  One is the rear camera for parking which is unreliable because the image could freeze or goes black completely.  Also some squeaking sound from the dash which is a reflection of NHV control.  But this is typical for a first year model of a new design, but it's a Mercedes and these should have been ironed out during quality control testing."
car_3821,"Classy, Sporty, Quiet Ride = Jack Pot MB","OK I'm a car guy. I spend way too much time looking at cars on the web and to tell you the truth this car was not on my radar because I thought I was going to buy 1 YO used. So I did my obsessive planning for about 3 months and spent 12 hours on a Saturday looking at cars. Problem was I just could not track down the car I wanted so we went from used to new. I loved the 2016 BMW X3. Its nice nice nice but it was the 1st car we drove and should have been the last because that was the car I thought we would buy. Drove the Audi Q5 but it's dated and is in need of a face life. My wife liked the Q5 seats the best. We also drove the Lexus RX 350 (AKA the space ship) liked the interior but the exterior lines are way too sharp. We were pulling out of the Audi dealer and I saw the Mercedes GLC. I knew about it and liked the looks but it was a 2016 and I was thinking 2015. So we took it for a spin and WOW it was smooth, love the transmission (A+ MB) it is quiet inside and has the rounded exterior similar to the Porsche Macan I think. The Tech is really good too. So the dealer only had the demo and we wanted a different color so we drove to Seattle (30 miles) and did the deal. (1500.00 over invoice) Very happy! My wife loves it. We drove it about 70 miles today and got 29.6 MPG mostly highway."
car_3822,worth the half year waiting,worth the half year waiting
car_3823,Nice car,Car is nice but little pricy. 4yr maintenance plan is $1275 don't pay more.
car_3824,Not what I expected,"If you are used to quality made, well-thought-out vehicles, go elsewhere.  Mercedes has dropped its ability to think and innovate to save money on this vehicle.  It's simple to look at the previous generation and see that that was a better car.  The GLK had bigger windows, bigger engine, more comfortable seating, and styling that doesn't look like they used an ugly Acura as a template.  The windows on this car are tiny, which is what I would expect from a current econobox.   The styling of this car suffers from the awkward tiny windows and bulbous rear end.  The COMMAND navigation is the worst I've ever used in any car I've owned. It actually shows you advertisements while you are navigating for Starbucks, Dennys, and others.  You can't turn that off.  The controls are terrible compared to BMW i-Drive or even just a Ford. It takes so much work to just advance to the next track of the music you are listening to, you'll end up just shutting off the stereo.  I'm a software engineer, and I find the thing so backwards and bizarre to use I just can't imagine someone who isn't a techie finding it simple.  They have all the features ticked to be on par with BMW but each are all done so poorly.  It's just an endless disappointment.  It has strange quirks too.  Start closing the sunroof and get out of the car, and it stops closing - but you can close it from the outside.  Why?   The Mercedes Me app and the COMMAND internet access is a total joke.  Both take forever to load.   If you really want this car, get it with no electronic options ticked.  Don't get navigation for sure.  By the time the voice guidance completes its total blather and gets to the actual turn, you're already past the turn.  It doesn't work well enough to justify the advertisements on screen either.  Get it bare bones, so there are fewer things to be disappointed by.  The engine, transmission, seats, and steering are just excellent - better than my 5 series.  The rest of the car is just a joke.  Also, spend some time in the seat.  The forward facing headrests are what you would expect from a Honda, not a Mercedes Benz.  The prior model GLK had active headrests, which don't place you in an awkward position.   MB cheaped out and used passive headrests for this car.  Prior to this car, I owned a BMW 328i Wagon (base), a BMW ActiveHybrid3 (Sport), and a BMW 535D (every option).   I have never sat in a Lexus and found it to be luxurious.  Acuras look and feel cheap and tinny to me.  I'm not stuck up, I just want the quality and innovation to be present when I pay 50K for a car.  I encourage you to demand more and get the best thing you can find with few compromises.  In that light, this GLC is just junk.   I just traded it in after only 4 months with it."
car_3825,Bad experience with Mercedes-Benz,"Very bad experience with Mercedes GLC 300 !!!We purchased a new Mercedes GLC 300 from Mercedes bens of El Cajon CA 92020 on April 29th 2017. It's only a half year time, Now the sound simplifier is not work, the dealer service told us we have to pay $1800 to repair out of pocket. It should be covered under warranty. But the dealer said there is leak from the trunk cause the damage so the warranty doesn't cover!There must be a design deficiency. It doesn't make sense the trunk is leaking!!! What a car! What a bad service!"
car_3826,I hate this glc,We drove 2 glks for a total of 7 years. The glc was a bad mistake.  The lever to lower the front of driver seat is non functional. The car throws you around when going around curves on the interstate going 70. The car practically throws you out when going over a speed bump. Had a flat tire and had to wait a week for a replacement. Bluetooth won't stay connected. Garmin is worse than having no navigation.  I could go on and on.  Don't do it!
car_3827,Does the Important Stuff Well...,"After 8 months, and 9K miles, I’m pleased to share that the GLC300 does most things very well.   It is clearly a well-engineered machine that translates into an easy and satisfying driving experience.  The 2.0, 4 cylinder turbo provides plenty of scoot when needed yet is refined in daily use, although MPG falls a bit short of expectations.  While the ride is firmer with the standard suspension and 18” wheels than my personal preference, it certainly is not harsh, and holds the road well for more aggressive driving.   The interior is a nice place to spend time, and exudes simple elegance with very comfortable front seats, great visibility, and a quiet cabin.  The rear seats are very firm, and offer no adjustments, but with generous leg and head room, it is fine for occasional passengers.  The rear storage with the seats up is on the small side for its class, however there is a large under floor rear compartment that compensates, providing usable and convenient storage.   The misses with this vehicle for me relate to some of the technology.  The MB “infotainment/navigation” system feels quite dated, and is awkward to use, although the audio quality from the upgraded sound system is very good.  It is unimaginable that Apple Car Play and Android Auto are missing in a 2017 vehicle, yet it is not available.  The MB app offers limited functionality compared to the competition, and seems to have about a 50% success rate in connecting to the vehicle.   Finally, the optional “parktronic” parking assist system seldom successfully identifies an available parking space, and when it does, the system is difficult to use…save your money on this one.   On the positive side, the optional “distronic plus” cruise control with steering assist is wonderful in stop and go traffic for semi-autonomous driving, and is convenient on the open highway as well.  This is truly a game changer for those with frequent commutes in heavy traffic!  The other safety related technology features (brake hold, blind spot warning, lane keeping assist, emergency braking) all seem to work well.   This all said, the styling, performance, comfort and overall driving experience make the GLC a joy to own, and I look forward to driving it every day."
car_3828,Think twice,"This suv down not get good gas mileage as advertised. The seats are her uncomfortable. The technology, specifically the display of radio, navigation and other options on the display are too confusing and not easy to navigate when driving. If your door is left open and you try to open and shut while the car is on park, the car slams itself into park mode. Not worth the money. My car was retailed at 52k. Never again!"
car_3829,Fantastic SUV,"I recently traded in a 2011 Lexus RX 350 AWD for the Mercedes-Benz GLC 300 4matic. The other cars I considered were the current Lexus RX 350, the Volvo XC60, the BMW X3, and the Audi Q5. I loved my Lexus when it was new, but it didn't ""age"" well from a fit and finish standpoint. Over time, it developed rattles, squeaks, and started to feel ""sloppy"". I've owned a Mercedes since the early 2000s and all of them feel just as solid new as they do when they're 10 years old.I wrote off Lexus based on the experience I'd had with the 2011 RX 350 and the hideous new body style. The Volvo XC60 looked interesting, but the revamped navigation won't be out until September at the earliest. The BMW X3 and the Audi Q5 looked like contenders, the the rear passenger room, the modern interior of the GLC, and the overall fit & finish of the GLC won me over.My other car is a 2015 Mercedes C300, which I've been delighted with. The GLC is like a C-class on stilts. One notable difference between both the C and the other SUVs I considered is the rear passenger room. Mercedes did a fantastic job laying out the back seat such that 6 footers don't feel cramped. The GLC has run-flat tires, so the storage compartment where the spare tire normally would go is opened up as storage in the rear of the car underneath the floor. It's a handy compartment to have. The seats fold down with the flip of a switch from the rear of the vehicle. You can also put them down by flipping a switch on the rear driver's side or rear passenger side doors. If you're hauling somthing long and skinny, you can put just the center section down, which is very handy.In terms of ride quality, I've been extremely impressed. The ride is very smooth. While the GLC shares the same engine as the C-class sedan, it has a 9 speed transmission instead of the C's 7 speed transmission. This makes for smooth acceleration and very good gas mileage for an SUV. I'm still under 1,000 miles on it, so I haven't done any zero-to-60 sprints but it is certainly peppier than the Lexus RX it replaced. Gas mileage and ride quality are a marked improvement over the Lexus, too.I didn't want to pay up for the  panorama sunroof, but the only ones available had them. Thankfully, I was able to negotiate a good price which made getting it palatable. In hindsight, I'm delighted with it. While the car does get hot when parked in the summer, Mercedes is giving out 5 years of free mbrace, which is a phone app that enables you to remotely start the vehicle, lock/unlock doors, and send navigation destinations from your phone to the car, which is very handy.As I mentioned earlier, my other car is a 2015 C-class, which has the Burmester sound system in it. Over the past couple of years, I got very spoiled with it and it turned into a ""must have"" for me when shopping for another Mercedes. Having compared the two vehicles playing the same songs side-by-side, the GLC's acoustics are a little better than the C.I haven't had a chance to take the GLC on snow, yet, but I've been very impressed with the C's performance in inclement weather. I suspect I'll be similarly impressed with the GLC when winter arrives."
car_3830,MB convert,"Shopped Audi,BMW, owner since 2001. Purchased at less cost than comparable other Germans, as MB allows to add ala carte features versus mandatory packages.  Great car  only  complaints, sunshade  can only be adjusted when moonroof is closed,  and can not adjust bass, treble etc. on the radio."
car_3831,Doberman transportation,"Extras add up quickly, and mbrace is grate."
car_3832,GLC300 HAS FAULTY AXLE WHICH BREAKS NEEDS RECALL,"Mercedes Benz GLC-300 2016 model has a serious axle breaking issue and the response from Mercedes Benz of Chantilly is pathetic, Me and my wife were going to Dulles airport on 5-Feb when axle of my brand new Mercedes broke in middle of road, had it been route 28, this would have caused a very serious accident for not only for us but Many others. Even after 2 months of rigorous follow up, all I am offered is a replacement vehicle with huge financial implication on me as GLC as of new purchase and for some time they offered loaner vehicle but that also is taken back and now this case is given to third party Stericycle to settle who will take 3~4 weeks to provide refund, I requested to know the cause of this defect so that others do not suffer but no explanation is provided. I am suffering from last 2 &1/2 months and would not recommend anyone to buy this car from Mercedes who claim to be the safest of all cars but it is not correct and also they do not care about customers. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE UNLESS YOU HAVE ASSURANCE FROM DEALER/MB REGARDING TREATMENT OF QUALITY ISSUES"
car_3833,First Merc,"The car overall feels great. The most impressive thing is the economy of the 240 bhp vehicle. It gives an impressive 28 on highway. (when mostly driven on Comfort mode/Eco mode, Sport gives around 24-25). Interior comfort and appeal is very good.  Exterior styling is superb.Cold climate pack is excellent. Noise reduction is optimal. Acceleration is more than enough when merging (acceleration at the signals might be a damp slow because of the 9 gear shifts, but again if u pump the gas pedal lil hard it will zoom). Learning curve with COMAND will take time. The touch sensitivity of the pad is not that great or accurate. It does sense the handwriting but to enter the whole address that way is a chore. The knob is much better to enter the address (Using mbrace app is even faster).  Navigation is very well organized and the voice instructions are very clear and crisp. Couple of major let downs-- 1.GLC does not have any integration to read out text messages automatically (was disappointed as even non premium cars have it, my old corolla had it). It doesn't even display the message automatically unless you click the messaging app through the touch pad. 2.We are not given the option to change the music track with the steering wheel controls--another major let down. 3. Self parking feature--Probably the most useless feature in the car and would not advise anybody to waste $$ on it. It does not detect any parking space or parking lines. I have the car for about 4 months and not even once did it notify that its sensing a parking area. I liked the car overall very much but don't let the base price fool you. For 39k I don't think you'll get anything other than automatic windows. Even at 60k we din have the lane departure, and few other functions"
car_3834,GLC300,"Big improvement over my 2013 GLK350. Roomier interior,equal or better styling, great fuel economy"
car_3835,"You read the praises, here's what's not so great.","Over all the GLC is a terrific vehicle but it does have some flaws. In this review I'm going to focus on some of them. My GLC has the 19"" wheels, when I go over a small pothole or small speed bump, the car really tosses you around. The car seems to be pushed around by the wind more than it should. The USB charging ports are in the center armrest storage compartment, there's no cutout for the cable to allow you to charge your phone while having it out. There's no real good place to keep coins. The GLK had a numeric keypad, which was helpful for phone calls. Now you have to use the navigation wheel to choose numbers. That's a P.I.A. when you call a business and have to enter numbers to get to the write extension. The backup camera has terrible, really terrible, low light resolution. Its image is very grainy, buzzy, and it seems that the frame rate is very low. My GLK's was much much better. There's a touch pad over the navigation wheel. To use the wheel you rest your hand on the pad. It's easy to accidentally change stations or selection when you move your hand. On my GLC, the sunglass storage compartment sticks when I open it, plus when I press it to open it, I sometimes hit one of the mBrace buttons by mistake. When I try to fill up the gas tank the gas pump keeps shutting off. I've tried about six different stations.  There must be a design flaw in the inlet. Lastly, the mpg is just meh."
car_3836,My first luxury car is a winner,"I mostly love my Mercedes GLC300.  It's quiet, solid, powerful and drives like a dream.  You can feel the quality of this car as soon as you get inside.  The interior is beautiful and the controls are all at your fingertips, this car is built for safety!  I love that my car is a WI FI hotspot and that I can access all sorts of apps without getting out my phone, such as gas prices, Yelp, parking, etc.   The Nav system works great.  A couple of things to be aware of...premium gas only.  I knew this going in, but I didn't realize how much premium costs over regular and how much the prices vary from gas station to gas station.  Also, I went from a hybrid sedan to this, so MPG was also a lot different.  My gas pricing app gets a workout.  Also, and this actually bugs me, when I use remote start, I can't program it to remember my previous settings such as heated seats, heated steering wheel, defrost, etc.  It will only remember the climate control.  Come on, Mercedes, even Jeeps have this feature.  Overall, though, I am very pleased with this purchase."
car_3837,Dream Car Does Not Disappoint,"I love this car!  Pretty much everything about it. So many cool features, the styling inside and out.  Of course it drives and rides great, very quiet.  But it takes care of me!  Whether it's the heated steering wheel or keeping me in my lane or responding to voice commands, it's the complete package.  And don't get me started on the parallel parking assist."
car_3838,Great luxury value,Excellent dealer in littleton
car_3839,Well built with loads of safety features,"I bought the vehicle with the top premium package and parking assist - glad I did! Lots of convenience features but most important is the overall safety of the vehicle.  Sure, it is more expensive than similar sized vehicles but the fit and finish plus the engineering are well worth the extra cost."
car_3840,Class Leader in Mid Size SUVs,"After having owned some 7 MBs, 8 Porsches, 3 BMWs, 2 Audis, 2 Volvos, 2 Acuras, 1 Lexus, etc. I must say that this vehicle tops them all. It offers performance, safety, convenience, and extreme value in one package. I can most closely compare it to the Macan GTS, which offers equal performance at substantially more money. On top of that the GLC is far better looking, and MB dealers easily beat out arrogant Porsche dealers hands down. The GLC43 is the most modern and newest addition to the class, and now ALL the competition pales in comparison: they simply have a lot of catching up to do. The vehicle drives beautifully, and all the electronic safety features are the least obtrusive I have ever used. You feel as though you are cruising the road in a vault: it's that solid and silent, yet it is still agile and sporty. As far as design/looks go, this car is absolutely magnificent (especially in the Obsidian w/Designo Package I bought). It looks and drives like a far more expensive vehicle and it's road presence is without equal. I say this after giving up my 2013 Porsche Carrera S for it, and after spending my career in product design and marketing. I was very reluctant to make the trade on paper, until I saw and drove the GLC43. Then I realized that the MB is far more car: more modern, elegant, safer, far better equipment, and a far superior value as Porsches have become way overpriced. I would also place every other competitor such as the Jaguar F Pace, Audi SQ5, BMW X5, and Volvo XC60 far beneath it every way. This car is a winner in every respect, and it truly has NO peers."
car_3841,Buzzing noise,"I bought a new GLC 300 2017, but there was the buzzing noise in break, park, and hold. This is not only irritating, but occurred problems in my ear. After I drove my car for a week, I had a serious problem with my ear in my daily life. Although I am not in the car, I hear the buzzing noise and my ear is hearting. I have a serious headache. The dealership tested and found that most other GLC 300 also has this buzzing noise. Particularly my car had a louder buzzing noise. I contacted the Mercedes USA and told them to recall GLC 300, but they ignored. Because I already paid and bought the car, they didn't care. DO NOT buy this default car!"
car_3842,MB knows how to build a car,"This is the first Mercedes I have owned.  The car is amazing with the details that MB though of building a car that is cheaper that the Honda Pilot fully loaded. This car has a lot of engineering safety, engineering comfort, and mechanical devices that simply say, please dive me and enjoy the ride you earned it.  I went with the 4matic, sun roof in Jupiter red, beautiful color :) I don't know what material is used on the steering wheel but its soooo soft and I love the heated steering wheel too. The engineered has a 4 cylinder with a turbo which pushes 220 HP it accelerates at a amazing torque, love it.  You can definitely see the German engineering under the hood.  When sitting in the drivers seat, you look around, it looks like you have this amazing car that WRAPS YOU around and ready for take off, it amazing.  I could go on and on about this car.  Mercedes has done a spectacularly job to design a car that can be purchased for 43K, same price a the fully loaded Honda pilot.  I have owned 6 Honda's but German Engineering kicks butt!!!! Sorry Honda you have a lot of work to catch up to this amazing CLA 300."
car_3843,GLC300 4Matic Overachieves,"The GLC300 is a beautiful SUV inside and out. The interior is simple gorgeous with quality materials. I've shuttled 5 adults in the car comfortably with a smaller adult in the center back. Living in Colorado, the GLC has been up in the mountains numerous time including snowy roads over 12,000 ft elevation through the route 70 Eisenhower tunnel. Performance from the paired 9-speed trans with the turbo 2.0 engine is outstanding. Based the E-Class chassis, it is described as the most affordable E-Class you can buy. The GLC handles very, very well providing a civilized ride. I've had numerous sports cars including a track car and the GLC is a very satisfying car to drive through twisty mountain road or on the highway. I've been very surprised by the mileage and regularly see it over 30mpg. It is rated to be 28mpg/hwy. I simply love my time spent driving this SUV. Well done MB, it is a winner!Update: After 10 months of ownership, I absolutely love this SUV! The mileage has gone up a bit and have a pic showing at 113 miles, 39.2 mpg @ 62 mph avg.. WOW! An important note to all regarding a suspension issue that has been discussed on various message boards that is simply fixed with a software update by the dealer and tire pressure change. When driving 60-70 mph over seams or bumps in the highway, the suspension will oscillate an is felt through the steering wheel. My SUV experienced this behavior after setting tire pressures in single digit weather and with warming weather, the tire pressure increased 4-6 lbs above spec. Dropping the tire pressure to spec largely fixed this issue, but was still present under certain conditions. When the dealer applied the SW update, which controls the electronic dampening on the shocks, the issue is fully resolved.  BTW - I was the first person to identify this issue to the dealer, so not widely experienced by GLC 300 owners. Good on MB to listening and developing a simple and easy fix."
car_3844,Our first Mercedes-Benz,"This is our family's first Benz. The car itself is as comfortable as it is good looking and well design. Entertainment and overall interface are simple, user-friendly. Get Burmester sound system if you can, surround sound music in it makes the drive so much more enjoyable. Overall, a great car for utility, family, sports, outdoors and urban adventures."

car_3846,Wonderful ride,"I love this car. I wanted a car that would give me an elevated view of the road , as I am only 5'1 1/2"". I have no trouble reaching all the controls. And there are several ways to control all the features, so once I figured out which were more convenient for me to use , the operation became smooth and easy (learning curve two days, and I'm older, and not a techie). The drivers seat is extremely comfortable. So buy it and enjoy it."
car_3847,Very good handling and comfortable ride,"Great handling, drives like a car."
car_3848,Impressive Mercedes SUV.,"This is vehicle going to raise the bar for this segment.  The interior is beautiful. Quality of build is impressive. MB did a great job with the redesign on the interior and makes you feel like you're not longer sitting inside a dated luxury car that your dentist would drive. Overall impressive performance. The drive modes, the handling, all of it feels more like a car than an SUV."

car_3850,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT","Purchased this custom ordered 2017 GLC300 4matic in April 2017.   Absolutely  LOVE it.  I'm an avid researcher & can tell you this GLC will not disappoint.  Cargo space could have been a bit bigger & I should have upgraded to the better sound system (loud music is a must for me).   I shopped this car, the BMWx3,  Acura MDX and Ford Explorer.  No one can touch the handling & luxurious feel of this Mercedes.  Oh and what STUNNED me the most?  The price. Never imagined I could ever afford a Benz.  Apples to apples, the GLC was the least expensive. Explorer & MDX are larger, but the handling, comfort & speed in this SUV still blew everyone away.  I opted for the Garmin map pilot (GPS) vs. the ""Command GPS"" system. Garmin map pilot $600 (uses SD card in console).  Far less expensive than command GPS ($2000+).  Although map-pilot still uses voice command (from steering wheel controls) .. but you can't use all of the other functions like ""send to Benz"" - which is typing an address in your cell phone MB app and having it send the address from your cell phone to your car GPS.  Cool feature, but was tryig to keep costs down & don't have any regrets getting map-pilot instead. Consumer Reports needs to update their facts as YES, you CAN get a heated steering wheel (a la carte for $250 & it didn't require you to chose black interior leather).  Most car companies over exaggerate the fuel economy. I can tell you, in eco mode I average 32-33 miles highway and easily 27-28 city.  Best part of the GLC is tons of STANDARD features (emergency break assist, back-up camera, etc).  lots of a-la-carte items, too .. i.e., heated front seats and/or , heated rear seats can be purchased individually instead of being grouped into expensive packages.  My husband has never liked SUV's of any kind - but swears this one drives/handles better than any car he's ever driven (Audi A4, Lincoln MKZ).  Consumer reports also state rear seat is snug.  It was crazy small in the old GLK .. but this GLC has more rear seat cubic feet than my GMC Envoy.  Stats are online, look them up.  The GLC is insanely quiet and the ride will blow your mind ... SO quiet, SO smooth.  Every little detail in the car was thought through. NO cheap plastic knobs. The finishes are high-end. Cannot say enough about this car.  Was able to get this AWD, heated front & rear seats, Heated steering wheel, panoramic moon roof, towing package & blind spot assist & Garmin map-pilot navigation for just under $46k.   UNHEARD of."
car_3851,"Luxury suv with goods, bad's and ugly's","I rent the base model when the car rental ran out of cars and gave us an impassible upgrade deal. Car looks great as I caught many glances from passerby like am a rich guy, funny it was when people judge me by the look, oh well!!! Here is the good, bad and the ugly. Good: look, very quiet, feel slow like 55 mph but actually fly at 85, parking assist with great view even in low light, great interior and fitting, really cold a/c, big trunk area, good space 2nd row. Bad: slow acceleration, only use super unleaded at least 91 octane, gas guzzler when use cruise control, no 3rd row, keeps asking me to rest with night driving almost every hour. And the UGLY are: rain activated wipers that  wipe like I dance on hot charcoals with no option to control its rate (make visibility nil and very dangerous; better with  slower swing so I can still see in between the beats; too fast and the water can't drain off the windshield); next is the rotating selector and the little screen that I can use my finger to write, instead I wanted to give it a finger; an absolutely waste of time, unless Benz replaces it with touch screen than I will call it AWESOMENESS, not yet Benz. The next troll is the seat design. Worse than an ""economy"" car. Not only my butt but all passengers ended up with butt bruises, well that is a little exacerbated but it was a ""pain in the butt"". The seats are tooo firm, Benz, unless Germans was spanked so much when little that they have better tolerance. And lumbar support for front seats are bad that I had to snug a small blanket there. Ok, I rant much now so need a break. Until next time..."
car_3852,Worst Car I Owned,"This is the worst car I drove in 40 years. At first, when I drove it with the dealer sales rep, I was impressed of the technology, i.e., navigation, Attention Assist, Lane Assist, etc. Perhaps, the salesman was very convincing that I did not pay attention to other important factors I have to consider before closing the deal. It was too late for me to realize that the car I got did not have a spare tire, but instead a run-flat tire. The run-flat tire is a small tire compared to a spare tire. This means that if I got a flat tire and used the run-flat tire, I cannot drive normally as the tires will not be balanced and I will be prone to accident if I travel for a long distance. And in case I got accident because of this run-flat tire, I will file a lawsuit for a manufacturer's defects. This GLE 350 was manufactured without taking into consideration that a car should always be DRIVEN WITH ALL FOUR TIRES OF SAME SIZE AT ALL TIMES."
car_3853,Apps,"All going well with purchase, BUT tried to download the Mercedes Benz Apps that comes with the 5 year mbrace Connect.  Nothing.  Mercedes and  mbrace say there's no current fix.  Of course, you can't check this out until after you buy the car and register it with mbrace.  Dealership says, not our problem, mbrace says you aren't paying for it, so we'll fix when/if we fix it.  Two months and waiting.   Mercedes shouldn't advertise it if they're not going to back it up.  Otherwise, a tad stiffer than the 'comfort' mode would lead you to believe, but quiet with nice interior.  It comes with a spare tire and jack.  (I hate run flats.)+Seems about 3"" higher than similar SUV's.  It does, however, have limiting feature for the lift gate if you're parking it in a garage to prevent scraping from the overhead  The Premium 1 package has the basics you need.  Suggest the Parking Assist package just because having the surround view is a hoot."
car_3854,So Far Very Very Good,"This is my first ""luxury"" car.  So far it definitely fits.  Mindful about a couple of reviews slightly downgrading this car's roadholding capabiliy, I got the Night pkg option which includes the 20 inch sports tires.  It grips/handles just fine around all the many curves I've gone around.  It steers & shifts like a dream.  The ride at all speeds with the 20 inch tires is not overly soft or firm, about right for me.  Comfort inside is outstanding, most notably for 238 lb me the front seat.  Quality of workmanship is the highest.  Except for some tire sound, noise inside is virtually non- existent.  Exterior & interior styling with the polar white paint & black Night pkg & black anthracite interior trim is fully satisfying.  My only quibble so far is the transmission shifting, a stalk on the steering column which takes concentrated effort to get used to - most especially you must remember to push the little button into Park before you exit the car, or it will automatically shift into neutral & possibly start moving!  I've got the hang of it now.  Being an older geezer, I'm also on a learning curve re the Nav, Media, etc procedures.  In sum - truly so far very very good."
car_3855,Above all else,"I buy a new car just about since a year, have had everything from bottom of line models like Ford all the way to the top of the line Mercedes. When this model came out I had to have one and not a disappointment. I had a 2015 ML 350 for about a year (only because I missed having remote start) until I traded it for a 2016 Escalade, huge disappointment and couldn't wait to get into another Mercedes. This vehicle is a dream, you get power, comfort, space, and true luxury all wrapped up in the perfect size sport SUV. I would recommend this (or any Benz) to anyone looking to buying a new car."
car_3856,Awesome Vehicle!!!,This replaced a BMW 328i as my daily driver. I needed/wanted a larger vehicle for highway driving as well as more storage and space. I am shocked at how well this drives and how sporty it is when in Sport or Sport+ mode. I find it quicker than the BMW and nearly as capable in the curves. It is unquestionably heavier and it is not a true sports car but the driving experience and sportiness are far exceeding my expectation. I love the semi-autonomous driving features for long stretches on the highway. This is an incredibly versatile vehicle.
car_3857,What a disappointment!!!,"For $136K with tax and license I expected something better.  Opinions vary on looks, but I think it is a great, impressive looking car.  It is fast, quiet, and feels very solid and comfortable on the road.  The airmatic suspension is wonderful in leveling out the ride even in turns.  The upgraded B&O stereo is amazing.  It's failings are many.  I cannot get the seat comfortable.  The problem for me is where my legs leave the front edge of the seat.  There is no thigh support extension on the AMG GLE 63 Coupe.  I have the multicontour seats.  You can adjust the side bolsters and front edge.  Like blowing up air bags.  The side bolsters will hold you nice and firm.  The front edge of the seat with the air cushion is just plain uncomfortable.  Like sleeping on a blowup air mattress.  It is hard at any inflation level.  Really, really annoying to me.  The navigation system is totally worthless.  I don't even want to detail all the problems with it.  From laboriously putting in an address to a voice control that functions only with exact addresses, if it understands you at all, and I mean exact.  If you manage to get your destination in, navigation can be a problem as well as it tells me to turn when I am in the middle of making the turn, not beforehand.  Thankfully Android Auto with Google navigation functions great on the car, but then you have to plug your phone in and out everytime you come and go.  An annoyance.  I am thinking of getting a cell phone just to leave hooked up to the car.  All the safety electronic stuff is worthless.  The Active Blind Spot Assist and the Lane Keeping Assist work only at certain speeds and with specific road conditions and markings.  So it is totally unreliable.  The Stop and Go cruise control is also problematic and not the convenience it is advertised to be.  Even the Eco engine feature only works under certain conditions.  If too many electronics are on, it won't work as to not drain the battery.  Too many electronics as in AC, stereo, and ventilated seats!!!  So this car excels as a Sport SUV car, but really, really fails as a luxury coupe.  I would not buy another one, and I find the seat so uncomfortable, I am considering taking the loss and trading it in for some other car."
car_3858,So far so good,Very good so far
car_3859,Best luxury SUV.,"You can read the reviews and buy a Volvo XC90 or Audi Q7.....or you can buy a car that exudes luxury and looks much more than it costs. The GLE is safe, luxurious, technologically advanced (it drives itself with adaptive cruise control and lane assist), and comfy. I test drove all of the major luxury SUVs -- Audi, BMW, Range Rover, Volvo, Jaguar, Porsche.  I also test drove the SUVs that are considered best sellers in their class -- Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, etc. This car blows all of them out of the water in terms of value.  The new Volvo and Audi may sound like they are technologically superior based on their Car & Driver reviews since they are new...however, the same technology is available in a more luxurious GLE for thousands less than the Audi, and the reliability is in a class above the Volvo. The Audi also looks like a boring Dodge minivan in contrast to the beautiful lines on the GLE. This is not a sporty SUV like the BMW X5....but I am not the kind of person who buys an SUV to replace my sedan....this is the large functional family car.  It is also much more luxurious than the spartan BMW interior design (BMW X5 is plastic-like on its interior; the GLE is significantly more luxurious). I want comfy, luxurious, practical, and value in my SUV. The GLE fulfills all of those criteria. Additionally, it is significantly safer. Best purchase ever. Glad I didn't read the reviews and buy the Audi."
car_3860,2017 GLE 350,"Great ride and handling as you can expect with German Cars in general.  I owned the ML350 before and I thought it had better ride than this one.  Gas mileage is OK and consistent with specifications.  Roomy interior but higher seats seem to interfere with tall person getting in and out.     Pros:  looks sharp and has a great road feel.  Lane departure warning is excellent and highly recommended.   Cons: electronics user interface are extremely poor, even dangerous.  Voice command is decade old technology.  Don't waist your money on Smartronix package it is useless at best - Does not self park as you might be led to believe and the cameras do not activate automatically when you pull into a parking spot.  Small screen without touch screen option is a HUGE miss considering the cumbersome user interface.  I bought the car 2 months ago because Android Auto is a ""must have"".  The car is already in the shop because Android Auto is not working.  Just think That because something sounds great, it may not be implemented as such.Mercedes has not been able to fix the Android Auto problem and has no projected date when it will be!Mercedes is a hollow brand, neither luxury nor reliability or customer service."
car_3861,Most comfortable ride Ive ever had,"I drive about 20,000 miles a year for work, so I needed something that would be comfortable and also safe, and the GLE 350 is both! Not to mention stylish and sporty, its the total package."
car_3862,Five stars for this outstanding machine,"This car is nothing but class. Previously I owned an ML 350 2012, and this one is more superior. While the Mercedes ride is as smooth as ever, the navigation system is much easier to work with and the 360°  Camera for backing upis wonderful. The interior of the car is soft very I appealing to the eye and has very nice ambience lighting. Acceleration is terrific as is the sound system. Five stars for sure. Pricey, but worth every penny."
car_3863,Got what was expected,"The GLK is a pretty good choice if want a small suv that is solid, quiet, and fairly powerful. It has a smoother ride than others in its class. I bought the car used with about 17K miles on it and have owned it for two years now. Scheduled maintenance at the dealer is expensive, but they give you a nice MB loaner and turnaround time is quick. At around 35K miles, the car had an intermittent check engine light. The dealer said the codes pointed to the alternator and a fresh air sensor in the radiator. I took it to an independent mechanic and he said the low voltage electronics are sensitive to small current fluctuations and replaced the original 4 year old battery with a good AGM battery. Eight months later and that issue has not returned. Other than that, I replaced the original Continentals with Yokohamas at 32K miles to quiet the ride more. It has been a great car for long trips because it so comfortable. The cabin electronics are not especially intuitive compared to the current standards, but I am used to them now. In all, I think the GLK is a good value."
car_3864,Actually believe this car has added to my life,"I have owned and test driven numerous automobiles in my life, none of which could be described as luxury class. This car handles, accellerates and rides so much better than the others, I now know the distinction of what a luxury mid sized suv is.  This car's handling and accelleration litterally took my breath away the first few times I drove it on a highway that parallels a river. It still, over two years later, is scintillating to drive and I actually look forward to driving it.  The ""set and forget??""cruise control astounds me, especially going down a curvy hill.  I just cannot say enough about this car."
car_3865,No blue tooth audio,Bought this used and was told it had Bluetooth well it only works for phone calls and I am having issues with getting the phone book to pull my contacts. Went by the dealer they told me they had a software update for it. I didn't have time to stay so hopefully that fixes the second issue. But I am stuck using a aux? My Firs rental has Bluetooth audio but not my MB??  Outside of that the car rides smooth over bumps and has great handling. Gas is okay but wish it was better. Quality materials and nice metal accents.
car_3866,Awesome so far,"Great so far. Ride is smooth, quiet and acceleration in Sport Mode is excellent. I would like to refute a few negative points that I read prior to buying. 1)the backseat- yes it is small and most times a tall driver will have to put his seat up for someone to even sit behind him. However, unless you have a family, realistically how many times do you really have people in the back? If you do have a family there are plenty of other options(ML, GL etc)2) Fuel Economy- It's not terrible. about 22 highway/15 city for me so far I laugh when people spend 40,000 on a car and then complain about gas. If you have 40K to spend you shouldn't be sweating gas. if you are, get a Honda CRV or Civic."
car_3867,Replaced an 09 X3,"Fast, fun-to-drive, small and VERY comfortable.09 X3 was practically falling apart at 58,000 miles, but GLK is essentially a tall C-Class, which are extremely reliable.X3 also had mediocre front seats, while GLK uses C Class seats, which are outstanding for even long distance.The car is also smooth and quiet, with handling that again feels more like a C Class sedan than an SUV."
car_3868,Went down from a GL450 and couldn't be happier,"We traded our 07GL450, which was less than a stellar benz...see suspension... I was skeptical when we were looking around with the GL in service, but was absolutely impressed with the GLK. Fun to drive...Not horrible with storage. We sacrificed our third row seats, but with the gas we were spending this was well worth it. So far the gas mileage is better than average even in the city. As for the ride the GL reminded me more of a lexus. The suspension is a little firmer but it rides awesome. I also have an 11 C300 and MB has done a great job with this platform."
car_3869,"Solid, great features, smooth ride","I had a Volvo XC60. Within 2 years, it was a rattletrap. I have gone back to MB with the GLK350 4Matic and love it. Solid - go over bumps and no rattles, just a solid thump. Command launch package gives you everything in Multi-media except for rear-view camera for 2K less. Ride is great. The car fits like a glove and is comfortable for hours"
car_3870,reliability,I purchased this SUV new expecting to get a quality vehilcle. I am a high mileage driver and this is what you should expectAir conditioning: Stops working after 2 hours of driving. Brought it to the dealer who said nothing was wrong. Took a vacation from MA to South Carolina. It Stopped..stopped at a SC dealer who left a long VM for my dealer saying it doesn't work. Brought it to the dealer. They tested it and said it was fine. It is not.Alternator: Broke at 49000 miles. Brought it to the dealer and they actually fixed under warrantee. They were not very happy to do it.Heater fan: The dreaded squeak as I have read on line. Almost constant. Cost about $500.00 to fix.So sorry I bought
car_3871,2012 glk 4 matic,"Little bit small but excellent suv, fun to drive and i love the style"
car_3872,4 Cylinder Diesel,The GLE300d is a great buy for long commuters and as a travel vehicle for families.  Short daily commutes are not quite as enjoyable considering the 4 cylinder engine is not as responsive as the 6 cylinder diesel in its predecessor.  There is ample torque so it is very responsive for an SUV.  The navigation and infotainment system contains a lot of tools and the apps are great: there are opportunities for Mercedes to improve on it though e.g. split screen like BMW does to allow apps to run side by side with the navigation.  The finishes on the vehicle are amazing as expected of a real Mercedes.
car_3873,GLE “The right size Mercedes-Benz “,This car has all the safety “Bells and Whisles”.   Strong performance in a great looking ride!!
car_3874,Not much stands out but nothing to complain about,"There are very few ""bad"" cars in this segment. After looking at this, a Range Rover Sport, Q7, Cayenne, X5, XC90, and even a Land Cruiser (which I still want) - the dealership mainly won me over by not playing games and making it an easy purchase. The 400 goes about its business without much fuss. It's very quick - but doesn't attempt to be a sports car. There is more than adequate power/torque on tap, though the transmission isn't always as refined as I would expect in a vehicle in this class. I hate that the start/stop function defaults to ""On"" every time you start the car or change driving modes. The leather seats are extremely comfortable, particularly with the cooled seats option in Florida. Cabin is bright and airy with the panoramic roof (even closed whether you like it or not). Cabin looks somewhat dated but the quality is at least on par with the best of its segment, particularly with the real leather and stitched dash (I believe it was standard on my car but is optional on the 350). The infotainment is okay, crisp graphics but I usually leave it alone when driving. Mine actually has Magic Vision Control, which is far less interesting than it actually sounds (and likely makes replacing windshield wipers cost a small fortune). The adaptive cruise control is definitely my favorite feature for my commute. Steering assist is nice sometimes but feels strange when you want to take over - it will let you (and you can turn the system off) but it's just something to get used to. This car is not the best value (though try to option a far slower and even more dated Cayenne with the same options) nor would I even consider it best in class, but you know what you are getting into with the GLE and there are few if any surprises."
car_3875,"under power, rough suspension","we drove the GLE 350 for a few days. ride quality is poor, i could feel most bumps even though i selected comfort on the suspension settings.  the entertainment control is confusing...  the engine felt underpower for such a heavy car.  we drove the BMW X5 3.5 a few days before getting this car and the bmw is much better in everything.. must better ride quality, engine is very responsive, it brakes much smoother than the GLE 350.  the only difference is here is that i think the X5 has a turbo while the mercedes does not, which made this comparison a bit unfair for the mercedes.. also the bmw is meant to be a sportier car therefore it will be more responsive while the mercedes is supposed to be softer and more comfort. but overall we are still very disappointed with the quality of GLE. we drove the older bigger siblings of The GLE, the GL 450 a few years ago.. and the GL 450 was also a big disappointment. it was too big and it drives like a minivan. i think mercedes still has a lot to learn in making luxury SUV. we drove the E300 diesel station wagon last year and we were very happy with the overall performance of the car.. so back to my point, i think mercedes makes a great sedan but not SUV."
car_3876,Mercedes gle3504matic,Mercedes gle3504matic
car_3877,"Not sporty enough, rough ride","If you are looking for a sportier driving suv, this is not it! Acceleration is just adequate for a suv this size, and handling is more towards the comfort side.After 6 months of ownership, this SUV doesn't feel solid. Going over rough bumps, there is way too much squeaks and rattles. The ride should be a lot more solid feeling from a German manufacturer."
car_3878,GLE 350 4matic engine seized,I leased GLE 350 4matic on June '16 and the engine seized on August '16 with 3200 miles on the car. Waiting on the dealer to know what caused it.
car_3879,Leasing is a bad deal!,"Overall we like 2016 GLE 350. But we do not like the lease plan, regret deeply. In the past we always puchase car. So we decided to buy this GLE, our credit score is excellent, the interest  rate is low 1.99%.  When we came to accounting office (Mercedes-Benz of Tampa) to complete the paper, this young staff sweet talked to us, selling the leasing plan. He told us how good the leasing plan is, how much saving we will get through leasing. It sounded so good, we believed him, and signed 3 years leasing paperwork, paying $789.40 per month. However, later on we found out the dealer advertising the same car leasing for $599. We are overpaying the leasing fees, plus insurance is $700 more per year than the purchase.  So we called back to ask for a change to purchase, he said that we can't change any more. We regreted to listen to this guy's sweet talk. We will pay extra money and lose the car value after 3 years. Leasing is a bad deal, should not do it."
car_3880,Nice Ride,Nice Ride
car_3881,First Benz,I gave my GLE 350 an overall rating of 4. I love the ride and the luxury interior. It is not five because I am comparing it to my former Lexus RX 350. When compared to the Lexus the RX is a little smother and quier ride. In the GLE I made the mistake of getting a 20 inch ring. I am a female and when getting in the step is s little high. Ok for tall guys I guess.
car_3882,Dang Nice Ride,"Sang nice SUV. Quiet on the inside with very few minor quirks: 1) Yes--you must reset the ride stability control each time...big deal 2) Ride is a little floaty but overall it is comfortable and roomy. 3) MPG is what I expected and yes it averages around 20MPG combined.  Overall, I would buy it again as the Mercedes folks always give us a great deal and service is superb. The AC works great and keeps it cool in the MS heat. Great job Mercedes...."
car_3883,"Stylish, Solid, Stable","The GLE feels like a tank, but is an easy daily driver that provides luxury and power with a feeling of safety and confidence."
car_3884,New GLE,We looked hard at the Porsche Cayenne which is a better car in most ways but couldn't justify another $10k. This is the 3rd MB SUV that we've owned and it's the best one yet.
car_3885,Traded my E350 for this GLE350.  Quite satisfied.,"One complaint about this vehicle is the poor gas mileage, however, I knew about it and chose this model regardless.Complaint #2 is the egregious charge for service; my first oil change/service A cost almost $300!!!  Outrageous!"
car_3886,The 'New ML' -Newer is not always Better,"Pros: Styling a little better than older-styled ML series, interior design excellent, comfort excellent, great cargo spaceCons: Annoying exhaust systemsounds at low RPMs, sounds like a constant drone at low speedsSluggish accelerationBMW drivers or older ML owners will probably not like this car."
car_3887,GLE350 - The Quirks,"We purchased a 2016 GLE350 as a replacement for our 2010 Lexus RX350.  This is our first Mercedes-Benz, and overall, it's a wonderful car.  I'm posting this review mostly to point out the ""quirks"" we've noticed in our first month of ownership.  Note that we've previously driven Lexus and BMW, so those are our primary comparison points.1.  No Bluetooth audio!  The Bluetooth only works for phone calls, not for playing music.  This was an unpleasant surprise.  If you want music from your phone, you have to physically plug it in via USB, and use either the direct audio option, or Apple CarPlay.2.  The navigation system defaults to reading directions aloud.  There's no way to change this default; you have to physically mute the voice... every... single... time.3.  The ""Dynamic Select"" drive mode defaults to ""Comfort"".  There's no way to change this default; you have to physically change it to ""Sport""... every... single... time.4.  The in-car Operator's Manual only works while you're in Park, so your passenger can't look something up while you drive.  And it's surprisingly sluggish; feels like a circa 1990's computer, chugging away to load the next page.5.  The radio controls are surprisingly ""dense.""  It seems to take an awful lot of clicks to view your favorites, or browse up and down the dial.6.  I still haven't figured out how to store the fuel cap in the ""holder"".  For now I've just let it dangle; I'm pretty sure it's supposed to have a slot, but I can't figure it out.7.  The printed/PDF Owners Manual seems to have been written for non-humans of some kind.  The language is stilted, the instructions are riddled with so many warnings that it's really hard to find the actual info, and the info itself is ridiculously sparse and un-helpful.  Please, car companies (especially Mercedes), hire an editor who can actually write!8.  After a month of trying, we've yet to successfully actually get the car to park itself, as advertised.  Google or YouTube this; you'll find tons of other folks similarly confused, including dealers who humorously try to demonstrate this on YouTube and fail even in the videos!  I'm sure it works, but wow, it seems utterly non-intuitive, and I really, really wonder how many total times in the history of Mercedes-Benz how often a driver has actually used the feature to actually park their car."
car_3888,gle 350,gle 350
car_3889,LOVE my GLE!,"I really love the new GLE! I compared it to the Lexus RX, GX, Toyota Highlander, 4runner, and BMW X5. Overall I think this was the best choice for the options and luxury you get compared to the others.  I have a 15 month old, and I feel like it is the perfect size SUV. It isn't too big, nor is it too small. In my research process I did find it challenging to find a car with the exact features that I wanted. So my recommendation is to check multiple dealerships for their inventory and really study and learn about the features available.  I was able to find exactly what I was looking for at a great price- it just took time and patience. The car drives great, and handles really well. I LOVE using the sport mode when it's just me in the car.  My car has the panorama sunroof, which seemed like a cool feature- but living in Texas I am finding that it just makes the car get hot really fast! Thank goodness the AC works quickly! Overall, it's a great car and I'm glad we purchased!"
car_3890,Best vehicle I've ever owned,"I looked at midsized BMW, Lexus, Audi, Infinity, Land Rover and none compared to the MB GLE300d. Gorgeous, comfortable, luxurious, roomy interior. Back seats easily fold flat. Beautiful exterior. 600 mile range on a tank of gas. Rides like a dream. If you want a vehicle to drive like a sports car, this is not it. If you want to glide along in total comfort, this is the SUV for you. I feel positively regal driving  this vehicle. L.O.V.E. it!"
car_3891,"Great car, I love it!","My Mercedes SLK 230 is now 17 years old.  I love this car; it zips up and down the curvy mountain roads where I live.  The hard top convertible keeps working; I bought extra insurance from the dealer because I thought that could not happen, but it did.   The design of the front bumper is the only thing that is flawed; it is so low it goes over parking curbs but does not come back without tearing the plastic.  The trunk space is incredible; I can easily carry large backpacks, or a set of 100 cu ft SCUBA tanks and lots of accessories with even putting up the top.  With the top up the space is enormous.  This is a great car!"
car_3892,Slk 230 should you buy one???,"The answer to the question his hell yeah!! This car is great. I've owned by benz for 2yrs. It's a lot of fun and always, always gets compliments on it's look. It drives great with surprising acceleration. People seem to want to challenge you when they pull next to you just to see u take off. Love the car would recommend to anyone looking. Very reliable and you get what you expect. Never had to do anything other than change a spark plug. Take care of it! Baby it! This car will run for ever. Top was slow at first. Spent $30 for hydrolic fluid, never had a problem since. If you take care of a car than you will love this. If you r a person that changes oil every 20-30k don't even think of this"
car_3893,Fun car,"I bought this car used, and very much in love with it. I traded a 2001 Caddy Deville in for it and glad I did. No the SLK doesn't have 275 hp or 300 lbs of torque,no power, heated seats but it's also not a Caddy. In all honesty I dont miss all the gadgets the Caddy had because I never used them ( well maybe the heated seats). Being able to take curves 3 times as fast as the Caddy, getting 25 mph intown compared to 17, and filling up a lot less often and alot less  money is worth it. Having a hard top that fold and hides in the trunk helps too. Even though the SLK has almost 100 less hp and torque it weighs about a ton less and is alot quicker and with the speed limiter not set at 111. Fun car."
car_3894,Head Turner,"I am extremely happy with my SLK. This car is THE head turner, so stay away from it if you are shy. This vehicle is a perfect blend of style, performance, reliability, safety and status. The retractable hard top works perfectly and it is almost like having two cars. The trunk is surprisingly big for the size of the car. Z3s and TTs are also great cars but you see them everywhere whereas the SLK is more unique and contributes to the head-turning factor."

I loved the ML350 but after just a few days with the GLE350, I knew I had made a good decision.  The technology is so superior and the gear ratio is different so that it has more punch from 1st gear on.  The ride is even better especially when you customize it with the sport mode.  I felt safe in the ML but this GLE is like riding in a bank vault with all of the additional safety features.  I see myself keeping this vehicle for years and years unless of course Mercedes comes up with even more enticing features during the next revision. AND it IS a Mercedes so I know if anything goes wrong or is in need of repair, Mercedes will do a quality job making it perfect again."
car_3909,Great Vehicle Benz.,"Great Benz I just got last month. Bad things First:- Lane Keeping Assistance sometimes failed working. Dealer ship has called me to get it back and change it for me, perfectly solve this, and nothing to worry about it.- MPG is really not that great, 20 Hwy and 16Citys, so in the end of the day 18 is what you get normally on monitor panel.- Acceleration, it is powerful indeed, because it is a big axx SUV, but it doesn't give you the feeling of any pushing-back-to-your-seat, UNLESS you turn the car into ""Sport Model"", yeah the comfort model is kind of slow reaction is like driving a boat, I suppose they intended to do it maybe to give your passenger a steady ride feeling. The Sport Model turn this car into a beast. 0-60 under 7 seconds.Good things:BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENZ, what else you can say, it is a Mercedes Benz, they always make everything as perfect as they can.

car_3911,Safe and Luxirious,"If you want sporty, the BMW X5 could be a better choice for you. If you want straight-line speed and off-roading capability, the Range Rover Sport could be more appropriate. But, if you use your premium SUV for driving around town, taking the kids to practice and going on long road trips, you absolutely cannot beat the GLE. It is the safest, most reliable, most luxurious and one of the most feature-laden SUVs you can buy in its price range and competitive set. If you want sporty, get a sports car or sports sedan. If you want straight-line speed, get a Corvette. If you want off-roading capability, buy a body-on-frame truck. But, if you use your luxury SUV like just about everyone else uses their SUV, then get a GLE. In terms of within the Mercedes line, I've driven the current generation GL450 a few times, and by comparison the GLE 350 has a newer design/sleeker front-end, and a much improved infotainment system. In fact, the infotainment system works much better than BMW iDrive and Range Rover's system as well - though the new Volvo XC90 might have the GLE beat by a hair. Get a GLE for the reasons I mentioned already and you won't be disappointed."
car_3912,Starship Enterprise,"When I back our new GLE out of our small crowded garage, I feel like the music from Star Trek should be playing that accompanies the Enterprise when it moves from its dry dock in Space.We're seniors and hadn't planned on a new car to replace our '04 320E wagon, until my wife rode in a friend's M class and said she never felt so safe.  A neighbor was riding in a new Accord a year and a half ago and was blind sided by an inattentive driver a year and a half ago and took a most a year to recover from her injuries, which made us a little skittish driving.  We loaded the GLE with Safety features and we are skittish no more.  I've driven a lot of cars in 50+ years (just about every major domestic and foreign brand including Lada). and this is the most solid and controlled. No problems acceleration to get on our 70mph turnpike with the basic 6, but you won't win any drag races with it.  This is a luxurious ""tank"" with every creature comfort.  Looking forward to taking it out in the snow once we get some on the East Coast.  I don't think it will slow us down in our traveling this year!"
car_3913,Good overall car,Interior is spacious. Like the locking/unlocking features a lot. It's a no-nonsense car. The entertainment system has been improved a lot and works very well without much confusion.HVAC works great. takes less than 10 seconds to de-fog windshield. pleasant engine noise.rides a little bit wobbly. suspension can be made smoother. so far so good. A good purchase during the times of low interest rates and easy to get financing.Bought the car from Autonation MB San Jose. It's a great dealership. Salesperson John Nguyen has been helpful and very courtious.
car_3914,Great balance between performance and luxury,"The new GLE-class continues to improve on the Mercedes SUV line first introduced as the ML-class.  The 2016 GLE has a beautiful interior with very comfortable and supportive seats, an extensive ""infotainment"" system (slightly confusing at times but full featured), very sprightly performance from the base 3.5 liter V-6 engine, excellent handling, and plenty of passenger and cargo room along with best-in-class safety features.  Given all that (and the Mercedes name), it's also quite fairly priced.UPDATE: One year and 10,000 miles later, I'm still very pleased.  Reliability has been excellent - no issues.  We have taken several long weekends with the vehicle and have been pleased with the flexibility and roominess of the cargo area (with the split fold-down seats) and overall comfort during long drives.  It has done well in bad weather, as well - both snow and heavy rain.  The only ""nit"" I can pick is that I wish the low-beam headlights were xenon or LED - as it is, the halogen headlights are fine during good weather but a little weak overall, especially when it's raining."
car_3915,2013 GLK250 vs X3 diesel decision maker,"Although I relay on feedbacks and reviews, it took a while to decide to write one. However, I wanted to write this review for people interested in diesel cars as I was, and there weren’t too many comments in regards to diesel engines. I was in search of a diesel car that will have a high MPG and be a little bit bigger than a sedan. I didn’t care about brands in the beginning knowing that I will sort it out at the end based on price/mpg/quality, etc.After narrowing down I ended up with 2 models: BMW X3 diesel and MB GLK250 diesel. I lived in Oregon at that time and the price in NW was higher than other areas. As I had time to search and not be in rush, I found a 2013 GLK250 in California @ $28K with 21000 miles on it. PURCHASE it for my wife.2 months later I found an X3 diesel in Texas @ 36K brand new, but with rear window busted by the hails. The dealer replaced the window for free, but I paid for fixing the wiring as the rain water affected the rear side. 1 year later, both cars have about 10k miles put on them, and I can say that MB is the best as performance. Acceleration: BMW is on 8 speed transmission and the car is slow until you reach about 30MPH. The ratio on speed changes is small and that will keep you slow. It is irritant to see all kind of other brands vehicles to be faster than your BMW car, from stop to 30-35 MPH. GLK250 instead is on 7 speed transmission but the ratio is distributed different and you have the starting speed what you’ll need. Comfort: BMW is better as the seats are a bit better built and placed. The infotainment system has more options (like a computer) while MB is pretty simple (for old guys like me).  MPG: I drove the BMW from Oregon to NY with constant speeds above 80 / 85 MPH and the MPG was about 30MPG. The driving comfort was ok as I drove about 12 hours / day. It bothered when I had to go to speeds lower than 30MPH as the transmission changed gears and it seems to not catch up speed at least as fast as other cars.  In the “city”: I did UBER/LYFT for about 6 months and I achieved about 28 MPG in a stop and go traffic about 8-12 hours/day (on the days I worked). During the winter (snow and ice) it performed excellent. No slips, plenty of torque on snowy hills. Now on the NY routes I am getting about 35MPG even more if there were no hills. The best was 45MPG on a 75 miles trip at 45-55MPH. The GLK250: most highway trips were between Portland and Seattle and the MPG was about 33MPG @ an average of 75MPH. In the city (stop and go) I am constantly getting about 30 MPG. But leaving from stop lights is a pleasure. NOISE: Definitely both cars are quitter than their predecessors and while running you won’t make the difference between the gas and diesel engines. However, GLK is at least 50% quitter than X3. Now if I would have to start shopping again, I will definitely not buy an X3 anymore, but 2 GLK’s. Unfortunately, MB is not making diesel mid-size SUV’s / cross-overs or at least this is what I know at this point. Breaks: I drove Toyota and Honda for many years, but BMW’s breaks are worst. You have to push hard on them is not like the other cars where you gentle push the breaks and stops without efforts. If you’ll check the forums you’ll see that breaks and rotors are a common problem for BMW’s. If you open up the CARFAX reports on autotrader, you’ll see that almost every 30k the pads/rotors were replaced. GLK has pretty much the same habit, but maybe at 45K…Hopefully this will help you take the right decision. Feel free to ask questions if you have [contact info removed]."
car_3916,Good  car for the  wife,Very good car.  Avoid too many extras to keep car  affordable when purchasing
car_3917,Great car,"The ride is as one expects from a Mercedes, smooth ride, great cornering and handles well in snow.  Great interior design.  Seating in front is comfortable and easily adjustable. Controls are all accessible. The map/gps system takes a while to learn. Great view of traffic and blind sight assist is terrific.Performance is excellent.  Fast acceleration from 0-60 with good passing on highway.  I have two concerns. One, the rear seat space is limited, therefore you can only seat 5 adults with limited comfort. The windshield wipers do not perform well in heavy participation."
car_3918,Luxurious details with high maintenance price tags,"I love this car so far. It is comfortable, drives great, has a beautiful interior, and turns heads when I pull into a parking space. What I don't like is the ridiculous price tag for maintenance and service at the Mercedes dealer. I checked on their 20,000 mile maintenance package and have postponed it when they told be it would be $660. That is for them to change the oil and do some basic checks. Yes, it is a luxury car and yes I expected to pay a lot at a dealer but that seems extreme. I also wanted to transfer the MBrace (their version of OnStar) to me since it is transferable but they will only do that at a dealer at a cost of $180. Same thing to update the navigation to a current version - $249 and can only be done at the dealer. I'll be doing all of these things but I have to prepare my wife for it first. She thought the $100 I paid my local mechanic to change the oil was outrageous. I haven't told her about the other costs yet. Just be prepared for this if you buy a Mercedes and want to keep it well maintained. Plan on about $500 in upfront costs for updates and transfers. Then plan on about $800 per year in preventative maintenance."
car_3919,My first MB and I'm hooked,"I never intended to buy a Mercedes Benz but after researching prices for new domestic and import vehicles I decided to look at used luxury autos.  The idea came from something I read in Consumer Reports about good quality used vehicles as an alternative to a new purchase.  The MB 2013 GLK line had decent reviews though other vehicles had better rankings.  I went through the local MB dealer in San Antonio.  Their attention to detail was wonderful and my purchase experience was easy and enjoyable-quite a different experience altogether from other dealers in town.  There was very little haggling, I got a great price on the GLK and am happy with my purchase.  I never thought I could afford a Mercedes but now that I own one, I'm hooked."
car_3920,New Horse,New Horse
car_3921,GLK 250 is a great ride with excellent gas mileage,"The only drawback to this vehicle is the tire noise from the run-flats installed as standard equipment.  Otherwise it is a great vehicle with no problems, recalls, or dealer involvement.  Tire and wheel warranty already executed for a leaky rim, but quickly replaced at dealership.  The tire noise remains, and no apparent resolution is being offered as a remedy."
car_3922,A Star of the Star fleet.,"This baby SUV handles well, has a nice power band, good brakes, and nice amenities.  The car feels solid and drives with confidence.  Good visibility, nice faux leather seats, good leg room and head room.  I went through the first set of tires in 40K miles which I didn't think was too bad, but not great.  Brakes are still good for another year or so.  I had a minor rear end incident when someone ran into me at fairly slow speed.  Repair costs seemed very high, but that's what insurance is for.  We drive across the country twice a year and this is a great car for that, except the cargo area doesn't hold as much as I would like.  Even with the short wheelbase, the ride doesn't seem to be choppy.  In all, I really like this car.  I have had no maintenance issues other than the scheduled A and B services, which seem extraordinarily expensive for a check over and oil change.  Though not really important to me, the cell phone interface and navigation system are clunky by modern standards.  I use the very good MB smartphone app to enter destinations because the voice and button search is too complicated in the car."
car_3923,"Superlative Style, Substance, Performance and Reliability","I have owned this car for about 13 months and put almost 23,000 miles on it. I have loved the experience so far and have had no issues with reliability. Live in CT and the car has been awesome commuting in the snow with the factory tires. Much cooler/rarer than the BMW X3. GLK's faux leather is textured to replicate real leather and has verisimilitude in its touch. Also great with rain, snow, etc. The sound of the doors closing is truly like that of a vault. Unfortunately a wayward deer head-butted my door while I was going 30 mph...but there was NO dent/damage whatsoever! Truly an incredible machine and I am so happy I chose it."
car_3924,2013 Mercedes 250GLK,"I love driving this little SUV. It has the Premium 1 package but no Navigation. I have been enjoying the diesel experience so far. After 16,000 miles, my MPG average is 31.1, pretty impressive compared to the published 28 MPG. I do not purposely drive slow to get that MPG number. I average 60/40% HWY/CiTY. My advice is to find the cheapest Diesel pump as it usually sells most diesel and keep the fuel fresh."
car_3925,"After 4000 miles, this SUV is perfect.","I'm getting 33 mpg in mixed driving (more than the EPA estimate, which is common for diesels).The quality is exceptional.My Mercedes dealer is making sure this, my first Benz, will not be my last.No complaints.One quibble:turn the radio off and the backup camera goes off, which is crazy.Ignore that eccentricity, and this is a perfect SUV."
car_3926,Sunroop Shatters While Driving on Highway,"Hello, I would like to share my review regarding a newly purchased 2013 GLK 350 4 Matic. I made my first long distance road trip on 18 December 2013 from Virginia to Tennessee, then Louisiana and to return back to Virginia after the Holiday. As I was making my drive through Charlotte NC on I 85, at approximately 4:23 pm on 27 Dec 13, I heard a loud pop. I thought my tire had blew. I heard wind like noise and looked up and there it was. My sunroof had shattered. My shade was covered so no glass entered the car. The outside of the sunroof had spider lines. Nothing had fallen...it just popped. So now the SUV is at MB of Alexandria. I read reviews of issues with other cars and MBs as well. Wow!"
car_3927,Love the Car Beware it has Problems and MB wont stand behind the consumer,"I love this car and it comforts and how it drives and the amenities. But BEWARE this car has problems.These cars have issues and MBUSA nor the dealerships will not stand or help you in the least bit. I have begged until I am blue in the faceThe check engine light illuminates after filling up with gas and in numerous instances because of a ""throttle valve problem that no dealership in Florida nor Georgia have been able to replicate causes the car to go ""limp"" meaning you can'taccerate on the gas.My most recent episode was a week ago on I-75 and I had to beg Mercedes Roadside Assistance to send a Roadside Tech to come assist me at night. Which they refused to do."
car_3928,"2500 miles in, so far so good",Have been driving the GLK250 since the end of June '13 and have had no major complaints so far. Zero problems (mechanical or electrical) encountered and it's simply a solid vehicle overall. Have been averaging 30-31 MPG after 5 fill-ups in 80/20 Hwy/City driving. That's from my own mileage calculations but frankly the on-board trip computer is not too far off (within 0.5-1MPG accuracy). I'm not exactly a lead-foot but I don't drive like a granny either (I'm 28 years old). This thing just eats road imperfection for lunch - I live in the NE region so there is plenty of that around. Can't wait to test out the 4Matic performance in the snow in another month or so.
car_3929,"great little suv, BUT.....","We own a 2013 rdx tech and I must say its a great value ,But after buying the 2013 glk350 It surely puts the rdx to shame in refinement.The only thing that bothers me is that the glk could use a bit more space to compete better instead of forcing people to go for the ML. Also, there is nothing like the smell and feel of leather and its a 2100 option on the glk. It doesn't work for me that a luxury brand like mercedes would come up with a gimmick like mb tech fake look leather so they can ask for 2100 for something that should be standard in this brand. The smell of the mb tech is not pleasing and smells cheap ( sounds weird). We sill take the rdx for shopping due to more space ."
car_3930,Love my mercedes benz!,"Having read as many reviews of the GLK as possible I have come to the conclusion that the average American is so spoiled they have have lost sight of what is to have an exceptional vehicle.One reviewer complained about the stitching on the steering wheel, several about the room in the back seat, others about the cheap materials on all models prior to 2013.Yes it is expensive and yes the maintenance costs are higher than average, and yes the mpg could be better as in all SUV's.Everyone knows that.Buy a Honda and if you think it is too small then you didn't pay attention when you test drove it, if you did."
car_3931,Tons of torque and great fuel economy,"I traded in an MDX looking for something a bit smaller.I had looked at the 2012 GLK but was really put off by the cheap interior.I was happy to see that Mercedes really improved on the interior quality for the 2013 GLK.I was a bit skeptical at first about the engine seeing as though it's a 4-cylinder, but it has an amazing amount of torque and when you hit the gas you'll feel it.It has plenty of passing power at highway speeds as well.The 7 speed transmission is very smooth."
car_3932,My beauty,Bought the car used but hardly used! Super charged 4.5 seconds 0-60 mph
car_3933,Great project car,"One must be willing to work on this car to appreciate its design value. I bought this 2001 SLK320 Manual Transmission as a project car. As such, I personally replaced/repaired most old-aged items, including sensors and brake rotors, to restore her glory. My wife, who owns a '13 Terrain and '15 SRX, even begs to ride on it when opportunity arises. Of course, we are Ford and GM faithful but this 1st foreign car does steal a big chunk of love. Unfortunately, I am only allowed to drive it once or twice a week because it's too sexy for my (near retirement) age."
car_3934,Love my car,"I bought my SLK230 6 speed manual new in 2000 (2001 model). I drive it every day, I have 138K miles on it, and I still love it. Yes, it has had some problems over the years, like the hydraulics on the sunroof, convertible latch and the hood all needed to be replaced (once), but what can you expect after owning the car for over 17 years. I have had the same mechanic work on my car since I bought it and it has been wonderful. My driving to and from work consists of a bit of stop and go and I get 23 mpg (city). The few times that I have driven it when it is 90% highway I got 32 mpg. Although you are supposed to put premium gas in it, I rotate from premium to mid-grade gas and I have had no problems. The exterior still looks great, the interior is a bit lacking, because the interior finish is peeling/cracking off, which I definitely do not like, and the finish on the wheel rims are flaking off which is unattractive, but it does not affect the durability of the rims. It has great trunk space when the top is up but when the top is down you have very little trunk space but I think that is normal for most hard top convertibles. I am 5'2"" and in order for me to push down the clutch pedal all the way down I need to sit pretty close to the steering wheel but I am use to that. My husband is 5""11 and he can drive it comfortably. Would I own this car where the is a lot of bad snowy/icy winters, that is a big NO, but since I live in Northern Virginia and we only have a few days of bad weather I have learned to stay at home on those days (rear wheel drive - not good on snowy/icy days) I love driving with the top down on ALL sunny days even when it is cold outside because of the heated seats and the great heater system I never feel cold. Would I but this car again? Absolutely!"
car_3935,Good car but small nagging issues.,"Just bought car which has 130k miles.  Saw issues when bought and am fixing but suprised as after car in production over five years mercedes never fixed since I have read all slk cars have following issues:

1). Interior paint flaking off
2)  Exhaust rattle
3). Trunk and hood hydraulic hinges not holding trunk or hood up failing

Love car and enjoy driving.  If going on a weekend trip trunk holds very little if putting top down so pack light."
car_3936,2001 SLK230,"I have owned this SLK230 for 5 years. I got it used with 42000, and now have 98000 miles on it. The only issue I have had is replacing brake lights a couple of times, the dome light goes out about once a year and thats about it. This car GREAT! People always ask me how much the car cost (annoying) because the way it looks. It looks like an expensive car, but I picked it up for a good deal. The interior is comfortable for a sports car, the stereo is amazing, the hard top convertible only takes 20 sec. to go down so it can easily be done at a red light. I have taken this car to its limits, fast cornering and hard breaking, so this car can handle all kinds of driving."
car_3937,Fun but has a Dangerous flaw,"Fun car to drive, very fast and sturdy. Reliable until my wife spilled a drink on gear shifter under cup holders, transmission locked up.Luckily she was in the driveway. Have read of people doing this @ 65mph and the car automatically skidding to a halt! That could kill someone! How does Mercedes not have to recall that and waterproof the PC board for the shifter? Right this second trying to dry it out so it will run again, hopefully without needing a new $700 PC board.BTW, removing/connecting battery cable requires a code to activate your radio again or you drive in silence: call the dealer for code."
car_3938,27 MPG in town,"This car actually gets 27 mpg in town rather than Edmunds 19 mpg statistic. It's a joy to drive and has required no major maintenance other than preventative along with tires, brakes and battery.  They just don't build them like this any more!  The most satisfying car I've ever owned."
car_3939,Great Roadster,"Bought this car last year with approximately 76,000 miles on the odometer. No issues until recently when the on board computer had to be replaced for $1500 - ouch! It's amazing how smooth and quickly the car accelerates. Before you know it, you're doing 70 mph! I bought the car that was equipped with the optional SP1 Sport Package (Sculpted lower body with aerodynamic enhancements such as bumpers, side sills, projector beam front fog lamps, AMG alloy wheels and performance tires). This is my second car that I drive only on sunny days. I've gotten many compliments on the car and deservedly so."
car_3940,It was a fun experience,"I totaled my SLK 320 when I broadsided a huge SUV.  I loved that little car.  It's solidly built heavy engine saved my life.  I paid cash for the car in 2001 and I'm really disappointed at how much it had depreciated over the years.  It did not hold its value well at all.  My biggest complaint was with the interior around the gear shift.  The coating flaked off and was unsightly.  I've noticed this in other SLK vehicles.  I didn't leave my car in the sun, so you can't blame the environment.  On a long trip, it's not comfortable."
car_3941,Awesome car great performance for 4 cyl.,"Owned for about 6 months now. love to drive it, especially with the top down. bought with 180,000 miles on it, but it runs great and had it inspected privately; everything is in tip top shape for how many miles are on it. those Germans know how to make a quality car. the top squeaks a little when going over bumps - to be expected, minimal road noise for a convertible. tiptronic transmission shifts smoothly. plenty of interior features, very luxurious. if you buy a mbz, you need to take it to a dealership for service, or at least make sure you use strictly mbz parts, and approved fluids."
car_3942,Great Car Fun to Drive,"This has been a very reliable car.  Very comfortable on trips with good lumbar support and excellent gas mileage.  Actually got 33 mpg on one trip!  Problems have been minor except for the catalytic converter, which was replaced under warranty by the dealer. This car has 80,000 miles on it and it will still get up and go and will stop on a dime!"
car_3943,Love it!,"The car is magic to drive! I was scared about buying an SLK. I read mixed reviews. I decided to plunge and get it. The retractable hard top was a desired feature. I wanted Lexus sc 430 so I could drive my nephews, but couldn't find one with my price range.  I love my silver. Interior is red and black leather, which matches university colors. Manual 6 speed was recommended and does add to enthusiastic driving..and limits my cell phone use because I need to shift gears - probably a good thing!  This car has Bose sound system and quality sound with top down. Car maneuvers like a dream and accelerates sufficiently. Behind the wheel I know I have a well crafted machine at hand."
car_3944,Luxury...hah!,"My wife purchased this car in 2003 from with only 3000 miles on it...in other words still almost in new condition. It looks beautiful on the outside and is pretty fun with the top down on a nice spring day.  Since then, it's been nothing but trouble.  O2 sensor burn-outs and associated problems ($1300-1500). Constant electrical problems esp. with cruise control. All sorts of exterior lighting issues like a poorly aimed headlight that Mercedes says can't aim any truer (higher) than it is (it shines maybe 15ft in front of car). God forbid you accidentally don't screw your gas cap on tight enough cuz that'll run ya about $175 to get the check engine turned off by Mercedes- Benz"
car_3945,2001 SLK 230,Traded my 2000 Green Jag 4.0 sedan for this little car. All for the wife. Even though I've heard the nightmares about MB quality not being what it used to be. I've had real no issues with the car. It gets really good gas mileage. Not bad for long drives. Great in the North Carolina mountain roads. Only bad thing. The wife spilled coffee into the triptronic shifter. $500 bucks to get that fixed. Odd place to have a cup holder in a car. MB replaced the rear tail light lense for both sides under a warranty recall. Put some Michelin Exalto tires on this car and it made all the difference in how it handled and felt on the road.
car_3946,SLK,Let me start by saying I love the 2001 SLK230 kompressor.This car is like finding the perfect pair of jeans while they fit in all the right places they still need some adjusting from time to time. I heard all convertibles leak as does this hard top right at the top of both windows.From time to time you have to press down on the trunk to get it open Currently the leather is wearing off the side of the drivers seat.They did have a recall on the rear taillight finally something fixed for free.As for the current concern when the weather is cold the stickshift refuses to get out of park unless you let it heat up for approx 20 min.This has me nervous. In 3 1/2 yrs.Just oil changes & battery
car_3947,SLK what a car,"I've had my SLK for almost 6 years. While it's sporty, fun to drive and I love the hardtop,this car is exhulerating to drive. Powerful, handles curves as if on rails. Hardtop operates like magic"
car_3948,A Beauty,"I love this car, wanted one for many years and finally had the opportunity to get one. It's a beauty in Black. 2001 with only 40k miles and perfect condition. I save it for the great weather and the weekends. Great handler and smooth ride, great head turner too"
car_3949,My First Mercedes,"Have loved this car since the day I picked it up at the dealership. A joy to own and drive, and problems have been minimal!"
car_3950,Excellent Convertible and Cute too!,"Driving this roadster is not only luxurious, but also pleasant.  When the top comes down, it is an absolutely sexy looking car!"
car_3951,Most fun to drive ever,"Only had it 3 months, but I just love it.  The most fun to drive of any car I've owned.  Great trunk space compared to competitors.  Recent 1400 mile road trip averaged over 30 mpg cruising in the 80's over Sierra mountains.  Takes curves like it's on rails.  Comfortable for 2 on long trips."
car_3952,Hold back,"My dream car is a nightmare. It has been in for repairs more than any other car I've owned. Many, many electrical problems. I have the passenger side brake light bulb changed on the average of once a week. Went to far as to have the entire unit replaced which did not make a difference. Had the motor mounts replaced at under 30k miles. The radio and turbo charger is new. I am getting rid of this horrid little car asap!! Don't let the asthetic appeal of this model of Mercedes fool you!"
car_3953,MBZ Owner,"We've owned MBZ's since 1986 and this is the most enjoyable of all. Like the hardtop convertible for driving in all types of weather in the NW. We swapped our '37 Ford streetrod for our SLK. It's much more practical and we drive it more. We've had no problems and enjoy every moment of driving, plus there's no room for the kids and dogs. MBZ did a great job of design and performance."
car_3954,Not for the long run,"I've had my SLK for almost 6 years.  While it's sporty, fun to drive and I love the hardtop, it's not the MB quality I expected.  I've had a problem with the O2 sensor, the computer chip for the hardtop (2 times), leaking windows, recurring taillight burnout, a stuck gas guage needle, and water leaking into the electrical system.  This past year I've spent almost $5K in repairs."
car_3955,Best Car I Ever Had,"This car is exhulerating to drive. Powerful, handles curves as if on rails. Hardtop operates like magic. No Problems after three years!"
car_3956,Fun...But...,"Let me start by saying how much I love my 320. Looks sleek, nice handling. Over all a beautiful car. I got a really great price for it $16,000 off the orignal sticker price. I've had it a year and have put about 3,000 miles on it. However there are a few annoyances I've had with it. For starters the driver side window leaks so forget about taking it thru the car wash unless you want to get drenched. Sometimes the trunk doesn't stay open. My mom almost got her head sliced off taking the groceries out. The retractable hard top has been fixed 2x. And the biggest pain, The brake light continually goes out. Other than that everything is ok. I get a a lot of compliments and head turns."
car_3957,Fun to Drive,"Traded my 4.0 S type Jag for this little roadster. That is for the wife.  I'm 6'1 and I'm comfortable in the car. It's a fun car to drive! Fast, nimble, and great gas mileage. I have not had any problems with my hard top roof thus far.  Fun to drive in the mountains of Norh Carolina with the top down.  Haven't had any real issues with the car, mechanical or otherwise.  My wife spilled coffee in the Triptronic shifter. $500 to get it fixed. Kind of a weird place to have a drink holder which sits towering above the gear shift lever in this car.  I can be doing 100mph in the car and really not know it.  Rides like a champ, and road noise is not as bad as I thought with the top up."
car_3958,Nothing Better,"I purchased my SLK 320 with about 30,000 miles on it. I upgraded from my 1999 SLK 230 Kompressor. Ever since I have owned the car my only regret has been that I didn't own it sooner. Great gas mileage, not as great as the 4cyl. But the V6 in the 320 is worth it for the power and the smoother ride. Great handling, Great looks. I still take the long way home. Did very well the 1 and only time it got caught in a freak snow storm. 1st and last time it will see the snow though. All and all if you are looking for a great 2 seater car with pleanty of power, affordable gas, and a great headturner, then this is the car for you."
car_3959,Simply recommendable,A so far very reliable car with an excellent look and feel of quality and driving. Maintenance cost is high though.
car_3960,Closest to Perfection,"Been driving this car for a year now and I really love it! Excellent and extremely smooth acceleration. Great top speed. Car is light so if you go faster than 80 mph, you'll feel you're really 'flying'. Great at turns, very stable. I'm amazed at its fuel economy despite its being quite a fast car. The mileage is comparable to that of the  C240, and a little better than the C320 despite both of them using the same engine. I see it as a 3-in- 1 car: Sports, convertible and a roadster; the kind of car that is very suitable in states like California or Nevada. Quite flexible for tuning and dressing it up: very suitable with Brabus, AMG and Lorinser customization"
car_3961,Perfect Urban Commuter,"It's been a great car for commuting on city streets 
in Houston, where the weather is warm and the top 
can stay down most of the year.  Lots of torque for 
accelerating from stop lights.  Decent gas mileage.

It's also surprisingly good on long roads trips.  
Adequate trunk, unlike any of its competitors.  
Quiet, and a pleasant cruiser.  Phenomenally solid 
and secure at 140mph!  ;-)

The 30 or so improvements made starting with the 
2001 model year made the SLK a much better car.  
Don't buy an older one!"
car_3962,Problematic,"it's a fun car, when it's not in the 
shop.  I've had my hardtop break, and 
the roof get all scratched up in the 
process.  It was in the shop for a 
month on that.  I've had a leak in the 
window, in the engine, in the radiator, 
and a taillight that continuously burns 
out.  It's just been a pain to upkeep, 
and I'm only at 17,000 miles."
car_3963,I never smiled so much.....,"Have been in market for a convertible 
for about a year and found this one at 
a CarMax in May, 2004.  After driving 
BMWs, the Honda 2000, Nissan's 350Z, 
etc, I found the CAR OF MY DREAMS.  
Unbelievable performance, ride, 
handling, and the clincher was the 
retractable hard-top.  Never in my life 
have I driven a car that keeps me 
smiling EVERY second behind the wheel.  
Yes, this gem only will be on the road 
on sunny weekend days, but wow...it's 
unbelievable!"
car_3964,GREAT CAR,"BEST CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN AND I HAVE 
BEEN IN AUTO SALES OVER 14 YEARS, HAD A 
BMW NOT HAS FUN TO DRIVE HAS THE 320."
car_3965,My 2001 SLK Experience,"Thinking I was buying a 
Mercedes ""quality"" product, I found 
some discouraging problems with mine. 
First, I got stuck with the hard top 
stuck in the trunk, and had to drive it 
to the dealership to get it fixed. 
After they fixed it, I found that they 
scratched the roof while bringing the 
top up. Then the whole computer system 
broke down, and I was only able to 
drive my car 25 mph until I could get 
it home. I have also found that the 
inside of the car is peeling on the 
center console, and the leather on my 
steering wheel is coming off. Please 
keep in mind that I bought this car 
brand new, and it still has 25000 miles 
of warranty left."
car_3966,great car,"This car turns heads and turns well. 
It is very quiet with the top up, 
which everyone comments on. A lot of 
my friends have BMW,Honda, with cloth 
tops.  They all say they wish they had 
bought a SLK. Handles, corners, 
extremly well. Best thing I bought for 
myself!"
car_3967,SLK rhymes with Silk!,"The SLK320 is a beautifully sculpted 
vehicle and I would have bought it on 
that alone.  Handling and performance 
are excellent for the price.  Comfort 
and space is excellent for my 6'1"" 
height."
car_3968,Driving Machine!,"Having driven earlier MB models in the 
1970's and 1980's, I am impressed 
with the lack of stodginess in this 
vehicle.  The SLK 320 looks, drives 
and feels like a true sports car.  I 
can not find anything to dislike, and 
this car puts the FUN back in driving. 
I can't wait for spring so I can begin 
tooling around with the hardtop down.  
What a machine!"
car_3969,SLK 320 - FUN MACHINE,"Absolutely fun to drive.  Feel the 
freedom with top off and Mercedes 
Engineering"
car_3970,MB SLK 230 - Great car,"Performs great, looks great, extremely
fun to drive.  Couple things to know -
if you leave it in the sun, occasionally
the hardtop gets stuck and to open the
trunk you need to press down on it."
car_3971,"6'2"" Driver with Room to Spare","I wanted a porsche boxster but couldn't 
handle my height...went with a Chrome 
Yellow SLK 230 Kompressor and I am in 
heaven...the only thing i do not like is the 
SEATS! They should have put a more plush 
seat like in the SL. It took some getting used 
to but I smile everytime I get behind the 
wheel. AWESOME CAR. You have it 
all...sporty, classy, good gas mileage and a 
HARDTOP CONVERTIBLE! No other car in 
its class offers it...when will the others wake 
up?"
car_3972,The Most Affordable Hardtop Convertible,"I have always refrained from 
convertibles because softtops seem to 
cause the car to age quickly and also 
appear to be unreliable.  Thanks to MB 
for its innovative technology,  a 
retractable hardtop is like a dream 
comes true - incorporates the best of 
two worlds, not to mention it is the 
most affordable hardtop convertible out 
there as of this date.  
The SLK is too much fun to drive; the 
320 model drives and sounds smoother 
especially during tight cornering; with 
wood trim as standard interior, it is 
even more classy and luxurious.
I have had problems opening the trunk 
once or twice, but who use the trunk 
anyway!"
car_3973,Gotta love it!,"This car is rock-solid, reliable and 
great fun to drive. People cheer when 
they see the smooth-operation, fully 
automatic transformation from coupe to 
convertible. Gutsy performance, utter 
reliability, and good economy. No 
problems at all."
car_3974,What happened to MB?,"This is my first MB.  The convience of 
the hardtop is their, but I have had 
nothing but problems.  First the left 
driver's side panel was rubbing in the 
trunk.  The front passanger side where 
the roof locks in, is protruding out.  
The dealership claims that it was the 
result of the windshield being 
changed.  The compressor has been 
replaced, because the car resembling a 
diesel.  Since I live in Arizona, I had 
my AC on yesterday and the heater just 
kicked on!  Dealer stated that a chip 
malfunctioned, has been replaced and 
will not happen again.  I'm 
disappointed in the MB.  I just wish it 
held its value more, even mercedes 
doesn't want the car back!"
car_3975,Happy to have a real car,"I have had my 320 for almost 2 years and 
love it.  I love it when I pull up next to some 
guy with a mullet in a mustang and smoke 
him off the line.  I  get more heads that turn 
from the great exhaust note to the killer 
xenon lights.  I have replaced both fog 
lamps and many chips of my hood fixed from 
debris. P.S. Dont ever try the headlamp 
washers with the top down!!!!"
car_3976,Jewel of a Roadster,"Fabulous car with no vices.  
Bulletproof reliability and quality.  
While its not the sports car drive you 
will find in a Porsche it has a much 
nicer interior and an automatically 
retractable steel top.  Also as a 
Mercedes its going to be safe if for 
any reason you get into an accident.  
If you are going to drive around a 
small roadster in SUV country you 
might want to consider this.

The 320 6 cylinder motor makes this a 
much smoother, better sounding and 
quicker car than the 230.

I never had any problems whatsoever 
with this car."
car_3977,Dream Automobilie,"I feel very fortunate to have this 
car.  It is so fun to drive. I bought 
it used and the Starmark extended 
warranty as well, so I have 6 yrs of 
warranty left on it.  Paint job is not 
as smooth as it should be.  Minor 
problem with the trunk opening.  But 
other than that, the car has been 
perfect.  I cannot conceive having or 
wanting any other car.  I plan on 
having it for many years to come."
car_3978,Very disappointed,"I have had my SLK for 15 months - first 
6 uneventful.  Likes:  Love the body 
style and the retractable hardtop.  
Little road noise.  Car handles well 
and is relatively comfortable - even on 
trips for several hours.  Dislikes: I 
now live at the Mercedes service 
department.  Have had bad alternator, 
two separate tail light failures, 
leather flakes off door handles and 
center console, repairs on the roof and 
numerous other minor problems.  All of 
these have been repaired under 
warranty - so just the inconvenience.  
Overall, I am very disappointed with 
the quality of this car.  I expected 
more from Mercedes and will not be a 
repeat customer."
car_3979,slk review,"fabulous to drive, safe and heads turn 
all the time."
car_3980,The Perfect Car,"This is the perfect car in town or on the 
highway.  She acts like she has velcro on 
her feet in the rain.  I would have to 
take some 'real' driving lessons to fully 
use her capabilities."
car_3981,Mechnical problem with my trunk,"Great car to drive or show-off around town, except a few issues w/ my truck. 
It is not the size, but had problem opening it when it is hot...think it is a 
mechanical issue...also read complains from other owners. The problem can 
be resolved by moving the roof (open or close) so the trunk will open up..but 
not exact Merc's quality."
car_3982,little yellow SKL320,"I purchased my ""sunburst yellow"" SLK320 
in 2000 and love driving it any chance 
i get. The only drawbacks i have with 
it are: 1) issues with paint job 2) the 
ASB light and and dash light that is 
intermitted. otherwise it has held up 
great."
car_3983,I love this car!,"I've owned this car for just shy of 1 
year now, and continue to love it.  It 
is a great blend of style, comfort, 
performance. The ride is quite smooth 
and comfortable (actually better than 
many sedans!). And, considering it's a 
2-seat sports car, I find it actually 
is reasonably practical too.  Even with 
the top down (which reduces the trunk 
space), I can fit 8 bags of groceries 
in the trunk.  And the constant 
comments & looks from other drivers & 
even people on the street adds a little 
extra enjoyment - I'm sure they'd all 
be shocked at how reasonably priced 
this car is (under $40k base).  
Overall, M-B has done a fabulous job 
with this car."
car_3984,a joy to drive!,"A wonderful car for two people! Hard 
top retracting never fails to bring 
smiles. Overall drive is very sporty, 
not at all mushy, sticks to the road 
like glue with the right tires. Highly 
recommended for people without 
kids or as second (or third!) car for 
wekends. Not great in snow even 
with decent snow radials."
car_3985,Just keeps getting better,"I have been driving the car for just over a year now and it just keeps getting better.  I opted for the manual 6 and this adds to the fun, great exhaust note too.  When hard top is up it feels like a sedan.  I have not had any problems and at 9000 miles it is now starting to get even smoother and loosen up a little.  Highly recommend it."
car_3986,Nice Little MB,"Have owned for about 8 months in Alaska so have only put on 3000 mi. Had to purchase winter studkess tires due to the original HP tires were not for winter driving.The winter tires have done the trick, the car handles very well with just the rear wheel drive due to the Positive Stability system. It is a fun Car with all the ""Klass"" you could ask for. Not exactly fast, but Quick enough & Smooth as Silk."
car_3987,Love it.,This is such a fun car.  I was worried about trunk space that hasn't been a problem.  I travel a lot and usually need to carry a fair sized bag and a computer.  If you get a fairly flat bag it's no problem.
car_3988,my red convertible,This is my second benz.  I traded my 98 C230(was my favorite car).  I love the ride and quality of my SLK.  Gives that bank vault like ride that my C class gave.  Definitely a collector car of the future.  I plan on keeping this car for a very long time.
car_3989,Great Car After All These Years,"I owned my 2004 SLK 230 until this past November when I traded it in on a BMW Z4.Although I do love the BMW, I will always have a place in my heart for the Mercedes.I kept the SLK until it had over 147K and it was as solid and reliable on the day I traded it in as the day I purchased it.It was and probably remains a truly outstanding car and despite my joy in driving the BMW, the Mercedes will always be remembered as a wonderful car that gave me nothing but GREAT service."
car_3990,GREAT CAR,"I have now owned my car for over 31/2 years and it has 125k miles on it.I purchased the car in Nov. of 2006 and at the time it had 16K miles.I have now put over 109K miles on it and nothing has ever gpone wrong or prevented me from getting where I had to go.I have serviced it on a regular basis and it has performed very well.The reason I bought the 2004 SLK in 2006 was because my 2002 SLK was hit by another car and I wanted a new one but didn't like the body style of the 2005-2006 model.I remain very happy with my SLK and await the next body style when I will most likely get another SLK.Robert Portney, MD"
car_3991,My SLK Love Affair,"I have had this SLK for almost 3.5 years and despite the cars age and having 103,000 miles on it, it still feels rock solid and runs and looks like new. I purchased this vehicle for $12,000 plus my old SLK in 11/2006, even though the 2002 car had almost 90,000 miles on it and had been in a terrible accident. Thus, for a relatively small amount of money, I have had two beautiful cars that people think cost a lot of money but in reality only cost 10 to 15 cents per mile plus gas to run. In short, both MB SLKs have been extremely reliable and fun cars to drive and represented sound investments. That is why I plan on buying another SLK when the new models arrive in 2012. Robert Portney, MD"
car_3992,James Bond Car,"This Mercedes Benz will be collectors Car soon, the first SLK. It has the feel of Mercedes Benz and the look of a James Bond Car. Great for weekend get a ways for two or Mercedes Benz Club events. These cars will start increasing in value soon and everyone will want one."
car_3993,Wheeeee!!!,"Most fun car to drive that I have ever owned.  Car handles like a go-cart.  I don't think you could spin it out.  Have the Special Edition with the wider low profile tires.  Been very reliable except during cold weather, a supercharger interlock sticks, causes a check engine light and shuts off supercharger.  Need to take it in to have the code cleared to restars supercharger.  Dealer claims it will reset itself but it doesn't.  You may buy a code analyzer to do this yourself for a couple hundred.  Other than that, be prepared to buy new rear tires and brake pads every year.  Overall, the fun factor outweighs the issues with the supercharger and excessive maintenance of wear parts."
car_3994,Still Great After Almost 80000 Miles,I purchased this car after my 2002 SLK had been in a terrible accident and I was able to walk away without any injuries. I loved my old car and wanted another SLK but didn't care for the new body style. I found this one on-line and purchased it from a local MB dealer and have had nothing but great service. I have an extended Mercedes warranty that will soon expire but I plan on keeping it until either this fall or sometime next year.   I would love to find another low mileage used SLK with the old body style but fear they may be getting too old. I have had NO PROBLEMS with my car and will consider a new SLK Mercedes.
car_3995,SLK 230 '04,"I have had 2 SLKs over the last 6 years and the reliability has been perfect. I wouldn't have purchased a second one if I wasn't happy with the first car. I love the fact that it has a hard top and yet is a coup in the winter when we have a lot of snow and cold. I have had no mechanical problems with mine and although it is still under the CPO warranty until 6/13/09, the only thing that had to be repaired was the inside light. Even that did not cost me a penny. I love the car, the looks and the way it handles. I understand that the newer body style is a better handling car and will probably purchase a new one in about 16 months but for now I am very happy."
car_3996,A future classic,"This is an exceptional car in every respect. In my opinion it's a future classic (only c.4,300made most in US) & has better looks than the latest SLK AMG's and it's rarer & faster. It's a pleasure to drive around town so much so that even my mum could drive it without knowing what it's capable of. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing and will decimate most challengers. When you want power it launches you as if you're strapped to a rocket and that power still keeps coming until your nerve or the road runs out."
car_3997,Best sports car I ever owned,"I have owned many sports cars over my 45 years of driving, and this is the best yet.  The handling is good, and reliability is tops.  In nearly three years of ownership, it has not had any serious issues. Tail light recall is the only thing it has been in for other than the periodic maintenance that is covered by the warranty. It is such a keeper I am tempted to simply hang onto it for many years, instead of my usual three year trade. Kudos to Mercedes engineers for a fine vehicle."
car_3998,Marketing driven not drive dependability,"Most unreliable Benz car we ever owned (of 5). Constant electrical problems. Back to dealer over a dozen times-hard rains or car wash, meant alarm would go off, windows leaked, top and windows wouldn't open or close...constant heartache over this good looking poorly made car.  We traded it in the day before the warranty expired. No follow-up by Benz ever."
car_3999,Fun for awhile - but not a great value,"Car accelerates like crazy and is fun 
to drive. Great open air driving and 
nice exhaust sounds. Wish the car had 
a few more features or amenities. Not 
built for comfort or gadgets. Main 
problems - dealer would never 
completely fix brake squeak. Blinker 
light housing fell out of socket 
twice. Ride is cramped and visibility 
is marginal. Great engine offset by 
poor dealer service. On the one hand 
the car performs great - but don't you 
expect great service and some more 
features for 56K? One last thing - car 
handles very poorly in the rain, even 
below 60 mph. I had a CLK with Z-rated 
Michelins that performed better than 
these Continentals."
car_4000,take it from me.........dont buy one,"If you dont like going to the dealer 
every 3rd day for fixing, dont buy one."
car_4001,Versatility and Performance,"Excellent engine, quick transmission, nice ride for a sports car, perfect balance of sport and luxury"
car_4002,My Experience Owning My First Mercedes,"I went to a dealership in Wilmington, and luckily they had the style and importantly the motor combination I wanted. They took my for a drive in this car. I test drove it to the max. I was totaly impressed.I have had 2 Corvettes in my life time and no comparison. The supercharged engine, the sheer response of power and handling. Far greater then any car I have every owned.The immediate acceleration from a dead stop is beyond belief. The selling point is driving one. You're hooked. They went to great effort to get the color and options I wanted. My experience is, this is the best sports car I have ever owned. It's just fun, every time you get behind the wheel"

car_4022,The Envy of the highway,"I love driving my SLK 320 Special 
Edition...This is the first Benz I ever 
owned but I'm sure it won't be the last 
one. Unfortunately I had someone follow 
me home to find out how much I like my 
car...."
car_4023,Great Car,"The 2004 Mercedes Benz SLK 320 Special 
Edition is a great value and the 
performance is off the charts. I am 6' 
4"" and have all the room that I need 
for this excellant roadster experience. 
Windows allow a safe view of all 
traffic areas, thanks for keeping 
safety in your vehicles Mercedes Benz."
car_4024,I like it.,"It has been one of the most fun cars to 
drive I have ever owned.  I went from 
having an SUV for the past 11 years to 
the SLK with no regrets.  Mileage, fun, 
comfort, and in S. CA what place to put 
the top down!"
car_4025,fun,"the car is very fun to drive very rich 
and just a great german car to drive 
fast car"
car_4026,SLK 320,"The car is definitely not built for 
very tall people.  It fits me like a 
glove, though, and I adore it.  It 
makes very tight turns and with its 
small size, it can fit virtually 
anywhere."
car_4027,Overall,"The car was great. the acceratoin 
after a red light is incredable. 0-60 
in about 6.9 seconds. This car handles 
like a go- kart. Its a perfect car to 
just cruse around with. With one 
thouch of a button the hard tops folds 
in about 20 seconds."
car_4028,The Cars Sprung a Leak,"Fun to drive.  Hard to think, as much 
as I spent, all the little troubles the 
little Benz has.  Warning lights come 
and go, small interior pieces fall off, 
etc, etc.

But the real killer is when it rains.  
Mind you, I have the top UP, and it 
leaks.  My last car was a 300ce - this 
car does not even come close to the 
quality...what happened to benz"
car_4029,merceides-benz slk320 2rd roadster,"it is a amazingcar. extremly fast.I 
enjoy it a lot during my long rides to 
la."
car_4030,Our First Mercedes,"The overall appearance and handling are 
superb.  Leg room in the cockpit and 
seat structure make for lots of comfort 
for tall people.  The price is 
afforable, within reach, by Mercedes 
past prices.  It is a fun car to 
drive.  The convertible hardtop 
combines the best of two worlds."
car_4031,Nice sports car,"I had my AMG for one year now. I still 
like it as much as I did on the first 
day. Very fast car (burns a lot of gas 
of course). Comfortable. Excellent 
handling. Super retracktable hardtop 
feature. Stereo OKish, could be 
improved. Got the 5 CD changer as 
extra, highly recommended. Missing only 
a navigation system (is that extra?!). 
Looking forward to the 8 cyl. 2005 
model. ESP is OK, but most of the times 
off in my car. Small trunk, but this is 
not supposed to be a SUV, right?"
car_4032,Love my SLK,"I went from a C-320 to the SLK, and 
initially was disappointed by the lack 
of luxury appointments. But after 
reminding myself that it was a 
ROADSTAER this was no longer an issue. 
Not quite as flashy as the Nissan 300Z,
but being an M-B the understated 
pizazz works nice. Actually has better 
head and shoulder room than the C-
Class, and retains a small trunk even 
with top retracted. Excellent fuel 
economy but other than that not real 
practical. But hey, if you're serious 
about practical you shouldn't consider 
two-seater roadsters. Would definitely 
own another."
car_4033,My SLK experience,"My SLK230 has been a blast from day 
one. It's unique styling and rarity on 
the road make it a head turner. For a 
sports car, the ride can't be beat. On 
the interstate, the ride resembles that 
of a much larger sedan. Though some 
disagree, the handling is easy and 
quick. The 230 provides alot of power 
despite its horsepower vs the 320. 
Also, trunk space is surprisingly 
generous when the top is up."
car_4034,You gotta love the hard top drop top!!!,"SLK 230 Kompressor Sport: This car is 
very impressive!  There are so many 
things to comment about how this car 
performs and handles, but all you have 
to say is, it's a Mercedes.  The best 
thing about this roadster is how it 
tightens the faster you go.  Snow and 
rain performance is good considering 
it's rear wheel driven but you must 
have the good tires.  The trunk size is 
excellent when the top is up, but watch 
out when it's down!  It's like going 
from a full size suitcase down to a 
large briefcase.  I was crossed between 
the S2000 and this car, but once I 
looked at all the SLK interior features 
& hard top, the decision was easy."
car_4035,i luv this car,i have not had 1 prolem
car_4036,SLK320,"Tremendously fun ride; excellent 
acceleration; very sporty; affordable 
yet just pricy enough that you don't 
find yourself passing ""your"" car much, 
if at all, while driving down the 
highway. The only pitful of ownership 
is getting tired of saying ""Thank you!"" 
from the numerous,every day compliments 
while out in public!"
car_4037,Sweet Mystery of Life,"I just bought it in October so now that 
winter has come to NY, I have tucked it 
away in the carriage barn. Come spring 
I will drop the top and put on my Ray 
Bans. But seriously, buying this car 
was a good decision and Mercedes Benz 
makes wonderful cars! I opted to buy 
this car with standard transmission 
because if you are going to own a car 
like this shifting through the gears 
just adds to the driving pleasure. I 
highly recommend this car to anyone who 
is looking for the joy of owning and 
driving a beautiful convertible sports 
car."
car_4038,3 years of incredible fun & envy,"I bought the loaded 6-cyl model when it 
first came out in August 2000. My wife 
and I have driven it in all kinds of 
good and bad weather (just make sure to 
use HR-rated snow tires in the winter 
though), have experienced the 
incredible safety features (avoided 
hitting a deer with complete control 
the first trip out of town), and it 
still garners compliments from people 
of all age groups, who genuinely enjoy 
looking at the car! Excellent service, 
routine maintenace, solid 
coupe/convertible for two. Having owned 
several Bimmers, a Porsche, Acuras and 
others, the SLK is proving to be the 
best ever! Outstanding value."

car_4041,fun car with problems,"Fun to drive but problems with electric

it with all it's flaws."
car_4042,No Disappointments Here...,"They have got it together. Look out 
BMW!"
car_4043,Baby Dream Machine,"The car is incredibly fast. 
Mercedes/AMG have really outdone 
themselves with this one. It is a 
musclecar with true refinements and 
gentlemanliness.  WHile it gives you 
everything you could ask of a sports 
roadster it still possesses enough 
creature comfort to remind you it is a 
luxury vehicle.  It has far fewer bells 
and whistles than my S class but thats 
what I like in a sport."
car_4044,"nice car, very nice car.","I love my car, it makes me feel 
powerful, and that was what i was 
looking for."
car_4045,Solid & Stunning,"The G35 has more bells and whistles 
but little character, the Z4 has the 
love it or leave it styling, the Lexus 
looks like a bathtub and doesn't drive 
like the SLK. We opted to spend the 
extra and go to the 6 over the SLK230. 
The added torque and quietness of the 
6 and the interior upgrade on the 320 
were factors in our decision. On the 
road the car is amazingly quiet and 
the top is impeccably fitted. Top down 
at 55 with the windows up is perfect 
even on a chilly October evening. The 
radio is good but not at the level of 
our ML. The looks, handling and the 
rock solid feeling of this car bring a 
grin to your face every time you get 
in."
car_4046,"If you can get it, don't hesitate","Well this is my second two seater
convertible and I have to say this car
has a fun/cool/sexy factor of 9.9.  I
had before the Z3, which is an awesome
car, sleek and sexy too, but when you
put them together it was pretty clear to
my who was  the head turner.  As far as
performance the Z I had seems to be a
bit more torquey but the difference is
very minnimal.  As far as interior both
are good, but the benz just seemed to be
put together better with fit and finish
impeccible.   The car is very nimble and
scoots around the bay area and its hills
with ease.  So if ur thinking about it I
would totally recommend the car, and the
dealership was great to work with as well!"
car_4047,Really good performance,"this is the best car that ever came out

interior is a dream the gas milage is 
excellant"
car_4048,Profile of a Mercedes SLK32 AMG,"You have to drive this vehicle to 
really appreciate it.Driving it, is the 
seller. Its fast, beautiful , 
dependable,and has many features. No 
other car can compart for the dollar."
car_4049,Very Fast & Very Happy,"One of the fastest little cars ever 
driven. Handles like a dream. Living 
in FL, the hard top is mostly down. 
Not big on the electronics but who 
cares. Very good head and leg room. To 
AMG: I love it!"
car_4050,Slk,"Not only a great car but a blast to 
drive. although not as powerful as most 
like roadsters it suits me just fine. 
Who needs to go 170 mph in the U.S."
car_4051,Very comfortable mid-sized....,"A little under powered for the size.  Some confusion on the HVAC system, can't sync the pass and driver temp. No rear temp is inconvenient."
car_4052,Its an ok vehicle,Mercedes charges a premium for its cars and SUV's which seems to be about 15000-20000 over priced for what you receive with vehicle.
car_4053,"great car, except for poor information system","I have been driving the new GLS 450 for 2 months. I used to drive a Cadillac CTS and this new Truck gives me a similar driving experience (except that I don't want to do a quick/sharp turn) and sometimes it even gives me even more confidence in handling. It is very spacious; I keeps the 3rd row folded during most of time and carried lots of stuff in the truck (e.g. two large palm trees!). The interior is also very good for the price. The only major downside is the information system: if I had it 10 years ago I would probably have liked it lot, but in the year of 2016, this system is way too old fashioned. The information does not even have a TOUCH SCREEN! Instead, it uses a gigantic control knob with technology already invented in the 90's. Furthermore, some of the common controls are hard to find (e.g. turning on/off bluetooth) - one should be able to push a button to do it. If you connect your phone to the car via bluetooth, it can be very very annoying, so does the AirPlay feature, because the car will stop the music for any notification coming from your phone. And only two USB ports? Overall, I still like to drive this car without its old-fashioned information system, but I hope Mercedes can improve it in the next model - after all, if I could just replace that screen with my iPad, it would give me a much better information system already."
car_4054,FUN DRIVE,FUN DRIVE
car_4055,It's the road trip king,"Traded in my 2014 GL 450 for the 2017 GLS 550.  The GL was the best SUV that I have owned (Range Rover, Navigator, Yukon Denali XL).  On the surface the GLS seemed to be very similar, but I have found it to be more comfortable with an even better ride.  The seat comfort (in the front) is a step up from the GL.  Operating this SUV is a pleasurable experience akin to driving a large automobile.  I don't need the third row seats as often as I did (kids are grown), but the rear space is fantastic.  I especially like the lockable under floor storage in the rear.  The programmable driving modes are a nice feature as is the steering assistant.  I also got the off-road package this time with the extra height adjustment and the low-range feature.  This gives you some undercarriage protection and low-end torque that the standard 4 matic does not have.  The 550 has quite a bit more power than the 450 did.  The 9 speed automatic transmission is very smooth.  The technology is great however, the ECO engine cutoff is automatically activated even time you start the vehicle, or when changing the driving mode.  If you dislike this feature, you have to remember to manually de-activate it every time you start up.  The interior has been upgraded a bit, but still needs to be more like the S-Class.  Although the new center screen is bright and easy to read.  GL's was a bit small.  It is more at home on the highway than my Range Rover was and more comfortable.  It's too early to tell about the reliability yet, but my previous GL was outstanding in that department.  With the cost at around $100k, the GLS 450 is probably a better value.  The 550 represents about $20k worth of extra horsepower, leather seating and bells & whistles.  If I still had kids to haul around, I would have gotten another 450."
car_4056,Love Love Love It,"By the title of my review, you should already know I absolutely love this car. I bought mine used with almost 100K miles for a song and it looks brand new. As many posters state, it does get a lot of attention which wasn't exactly my intention but every time people comment or give those looks I just chuckle because its actually the least expensive car I ever bought and not sure why everyone doesn't have one :) It is in excellent condition and have absolutely no concerns with its reliability. Also, despite others complaints about the trunk, I was able to put a set of golf clubs, beach chair, small suitcase in the trunk with the top down!"
car_4057,My First Car,"This car is for people who are ready for a sportscar and the convenience of the convertible. Maybe for a graduation present, or newly weds, this car doesn't come cheap. If you want the looks, you WILL, I guarantee to you, will get the looks from curious and jealous people you pass in the streets. The car is pretty fast of a 0-60 time in about 5.4 seconds, which is nothing to complain about. If you want to get this car for the luxury name of Mercedes-Benz, this isn't the best model to consider. However, on the bright side of the car, you will thoroughly enjoy the great handling and sports-car like exhaust and ambiance that you will greatly receive from this SLK. Not made for long road trips!!"
car_4058,Nice car but not an S2000,"I own a HondaS2000 and refuse to trade that roadster for this one. I bought this 2005 with 11K but noticed the brakes aren't as smooth or crisp as my S2000. The driver side rear window doesn't raise perfectly and the rear tail light just went out.  This v6 has tons of power but quite simply its a sports car, not a race car. The car is much to soft to reliably do the things I've done & can still do with my S2000 (105k). It is a nice car to cruise, and ""look cute"" in. So as long as you treat it like a delicate baby, I imagine the car will be fine. If you want 360 donuts, & drifting.. get an s2000! - trust me."
car_4059,Road Trip,"Road trip from eastern Minnesota through the Black Hills Area, South Dakota in early September 2009.It was hard to get everything in we wanted to take but the ride and performance were great. Approximately 1300 interstate miles and 500 mountain hairpin curves. Overall mileage was over 27 MPG.  A great trip till I tried to clean off the grasshoppers. They just won’t wash off. Front grill and nose of the car is slowly getting better but I have never seen anything so hard to get clean."
car_4060,SLK 350 2005,"Great/fun to drive ! Looked at alot of other cars ( as close to it's class as possible )! Make no mistake, you buy this car and you will love every time you get in it! Lot's of looks! Lots of other people look at you with total jealously, knowing their car is not worthy !  Enjoy !"
car_4061,The perfect Sports Car,"I am not sure what all these Z4 owners are posting here, but the Z4 feels like a toy in comparison to the SLK350.  First, this car handles very well at high speed.  The Z4 seems like is going to loose control. Second, the hardtop is a huge plus. It accelerates very well, in the mid 5 secs, and the engine sounds like a race car. I have had this car for almost 4 years with only one minor problem that was fixed during the first maintenance. It has been the best car I have ever had."
car_4062,"Wow, I love this car!","I've owned this Merc for approx. 6 months now and I am so pleased. It turns heads everywhere I go! It stands out from the crowd of other convertibles (Porsches and BMWs). It took me a year to find one with just about all the features I wanted (would have liked the wood accent int). This is not inexpensive to maintain ($75 to change the oil myself). Also, have a winter beater if you live in the North."
car_4063,What a Rush!,"I bought a mars red 2005 SLK 350 following my heart attack. What a joy to drive, with the 6-speed manual transmission bringing back memories of my youthful sports car days. I have owned it for a month and have not put the top up yet and I live in rainy Oregon. I just don't drive it in the rain. It is very fast and looks so elegant that it draws constant stares."
car_4064,"Nice body style, terrible engineering","This was my dream car when it came out. I immediately traded in my BMW Z4 for this SLK350 ""donkey"". It was the worst decision of my life. The car does draw attention, if that is what you are into. The car spent more time in the shop than on the road. Replaced a manual transmission at 34K and now needs another. The engine acts as if it does not get enough air and strains in the lower power curve. The car is a  reliability nightmare and does not perform like it has 268 hp, closer to 200 hp. Mercedes has consistently failed to stand behind the car and has denied there are issues even when they have released multiple internal documents on its poor performance. Last MB I will ever own."
car_4065,Topless Performer,"This car offers outstanding performance with great looks. It can serve as your Summer car - top down, 0- 60 sprints in 4.8 seconds - or daily driver averaging 20-22 MPG. The sport seats and interior are superb. The AMG exterior styling is masculine but not over the top. Fuel economy is an ""8"" when compared against other V8 automobiles in this performance range - you want 30 MPG buy a Civic. Options: Iridium Silver, Premium 3 Package, Lighting package, Heating Package, Sadachiba multipiece wheels, illuminated door sills and clear front stone and chip guard."
car_4066,The perfect car,"I drove a few different convertibles, and was impressed with the folding hardtop (less unique than it used to be), heating system (airscarf), the performance, and great looks. I have had a good experience with the reliability of this car. I've driven 10,000 miles in 15 months, I have not experienced any problems. I have gotten as much as 28 mpg, though it's around 20 in the city."
car_4067,Some Problems,"I agree this car is fun, however, this car has been in the shop so many times for what appears to be a fuel purge release, consent popping in the right rear of the car. Mercedes does not stand behind their loaners and they can't figure out what the problem is. Does anyone? The car other than that is nice, fun. But when you pay that much for a car You expect it to be perfect. No more Mercedes for me. I will stick to my old BMW M3 I had before."
car_4068,Nice wrapper on a German beer can,"The car looked beautiful in the showroom, and the it still does. However, the compliments on its apperance in no way makes up for the lackluster performance and the slipshod engineering. I have back problems driving the car any longer than 2 hours. It runs like it is an out of breath patient. My Z4 (2004) could have run rings around this nanny goat. The car burns oil like it doesn't have rings and the dealer wants in brought in to monitor oil consumption since many have had engines replaced. If it was placed on a dynometer in the US there is no way it would produce the listed 268 HP. At 36K it had to have a transmission replaced. Overall it is a dog. Don't buy one, worst car I've owned!"
car_4069,Fun to drive,"I look forward to driving to work everyday now.  This is my first Mercedes and I love it.  The service you get from the dealer is awesome, you would never get that from a domestic company.  I got the car with the AMG sports package, and it is a very nice option to have, makes the car look a lot better and sportier."
car_4070,The Most Underated Roadster,"Despite the fact that US car magazines give this great roadster no credit, it is a fun to drive real sports car.  I test drove a Boxter S, a Z4 and a TT and I liked the SLK best - especially since it is the only premium roadster with a retractable hard top. My SLK is a 6 speed manual with the AMG sports package. The way the manual tranny is mated to the engine is a thing of beauty. And, it is so beautiful that people think I paid $100,000 for it!"
car_4071,Pretty Great Car,"What a car.  People stare at all the time.  It is very comfortable, and I am not a small person.  Leg room is exceptional.  Driving position is perfect.  I drive this car around just because I want to, and the destination is unimportant."
car_4072,Just Awesome!,"I traded in my 2003 Audi TT for a SLK 55AMG with all possible options, which I chose to buy over a 2006 SLK 350.   This car is incredibly fast.  The roar of the engine is music to enthusiasts' ears.  The cockpit although somewhat ""enclosing"", is comfortable, well designed, built with nice materials, and complements the sport look of the exterior.  The audio system is a blast.  The air scarf, although unpractical for Florida, is very different amenity to have in your car.   The exterior attracts lots of attention on the road and while parked.  I prefer the top up.  Acceleration is a thrill, and gas mileage is not that bad for 8 cylinders."
car_4073,It's Too Much Fun,I just purchased my first roadster - a pre-owned 2005 Launch Edition. I have never had so much fun driving a car before. I am in awe of all the attention received by just driving down the street. There is a feeling of such exhilaration every time I'm behind the steering wheel. All I can say is that it's too much fun.
car_4074,SLK Always being Repaired - Stay Away,"This car is always in the shop, the oil light came on in the first 1000 miles and was in the shop 4 times before the car had 5000 miles on it, Dealer actually suggested I had to put oil in the car. SRS system went out and electronics are flakey as well as the convertable top.  Mercedes quality has gone way down hill, as well as their customer service. They tell you when you buy, that you will get a like kind loaner when your in for warranty repair. But you get whatever rental car the the in house rental agency (currently Enterprise) has  for you. So after paying for a Mercedes, I find myself in a Ford Taurus quite a lot. Plastic pieces seem to break on the body very easily. Dont buy."
car_4075,Very Happy,I have owned C5& C6 Corvettes (in Europe). SLK55 is on par with them in performance. I selected the Corvette in Europe over the SLK because SLKs are limited to 155/176mph. On the Autoban performance in the left lane is the name of the game. Stateside the SLK retractable hard top is a plus to the SLR styling.
car_4076,SLK350 is my perfect car,"After dreaming for years about owning a Porsche Boxster, I had not considered or drove any other sports car because the rest, you know which ones I'm talking about came with too much stigma attached, not to mention their ridiculous price tags. The older SLK models always looked more like ""toy"" cars than real automobiles so I smiled but never bothered. On a chance visit to a local MBZ dealer I was offered to test drive the SLK350 and found that was the car for me. My search began in earnest when I narrowed it down to the Launch Edition for its standard features and exclusivity. It's gorgeous, comfortable and solid. I haven't regretted buying my SLK350 for a minute and hope to keep it forever."
car_4077,"Nice car, crummy company","My SLK350 was trouble free until 1850 miles. Since then the check oil light has come on at least 4 times. Each time it required adding 1-2 quarts . The dealer denied a problem, but I eventually discovered that there are TSBs covering this issue- MB was not forthcoming in admitting a problem. The car is great fun to drive, but I have serious concerns about long- term ownership, reliability and resale value. Lease it, don't buy it."
car_4078,SLK350 is a real delight,"I now have 18,000 kilometers on my 2005 SLK350 and it is turning out to be everything it promised and remains problem-free despite the usual spirited driving. It's fully loaded. The only thing I had to do was lubricate the hardtop rubber at the points where it folds. Did this once, was very easy to do, and it got rid of the little squeaks that had developed in the dry weather. Have driven it all winter in Northern Ontario, Canada on a set of proper winter tires, and the automatic climate-control system is fully up to the demands of even the coldest weather up here. The SLK350 is a perfect all-season sports car, and has a great engine. I have never had to top up the oil."
car_4079,Hardtop Roadster - The Only Way To Go,"Besides being the most beautuful roadster on the market, the SLK is now a real sports car with the convenience of a retractable hard top. All car  magazines praise the Boxter and ignore the SLK. I drove both and, although the Boxter does handle well, it lacks the low end torque and the hardtop of the SLK. Why buy a soft top convertible whan you can get a safe, quiet and more attractive hard top. It is like having 2 cars in one, a coupe AND a convertible! This is the way of the future. Plus the SLK is a blast to drive - especially with a six speed manual transmission. It goes like a rocket anywhere in the rev range because it provides all of its 250+ pond feet of torque from 2,200 RPM on."
car_4080,Funnest Car on the Planet,"With the torque, the hp, the 7-speed automatic and the size, the car zips thru traffic like butter.   Nothing else on the road like it.  And when you're going 80 and press on the pedal?  Torque is no different.  Someone following me on the fwy watching me accelerate, even from high speeds, said afterward, ""I love watching your car take off!""  The amazing thing is the smoothness combined with the speed.  It makes it seem like you're watching magic.  The definition of power"
car_4081,"Yeah, it's worth it.","From the retractable hardtop to the James Bond/Batmobile design to the MB star in the nose, the SLK 350 is just an all-around jaw-dropper."
car_4082,Love It!!,"This is a fun little car.  The only downfall is the engine/road noise while driving.  Too, I wish it had a little more storage space in the interior.  Perhaps a ""small"" back seat area."
car_4083,SLK,"I really love the car design, handling and performance. It's pretty quick and absolutely fun to drive."
car_4084,Best Car she ever drove,"No reason to return to dealership since we purchased. Super car for fun to drive and wife loves the 6 speed transmission. Feels that a real sports car like this new model should have the manual transmission. The ""Scarf Heating""makes the driving expierence in fall and early spring in PA exceptional."
car_4085,Excellent Automobile,I have to stop and breathe every time I drive my SLK 350. This is a top of the line luxury sports car. I have been stopped and complemented by complete strangers. The drive in itself is exhilarating (excellent handling). I have not and probably will not reach maximum speed; but just knowing the capability of the SLK 350 makes you feel confident.
car_4086,The Benz your father never owned,"After looking around the country for the perfect SLK 350, I found it in Lincoln, Nebraska and flew there on 11/4/05 to purchase the car and drive it back to Dallas. It was by far, the most enjoyable eleven hour drive I have ever made in any car. The handling was superior to anything I have ever driven; the amenities provide you with not only a sense of safety but comfort and entertainment as well. The superior styling of the automobile was evident by the number of people on the highway that waived or gave me the ""Thumbs Up."" MB has come along way in the last 20 years in its use of advanced technology that provides the comfort and safty the American public demands. Just test it!"
car_4087,Excellent,"The other choices were a Boxtser, or a 911.  The Boxster was a pretty rough on the freeway (due to the poor state of the local freeways).  The 911 was a much, much better car.  Glorious to drive.  But, it comes with the stigma of driving a 911.  On the road, the SLK has more than enough performance.  The additional power of the 911 wouldn't be something I could use often.  The SLK definitely is a car that people like, and don't associate with obnoxious drivers  - I've had numerous compliments from pedestrians, and other drivers.  I'd definitely make the same choice.  Its one of those cars that you will drive just for the sake of it and always be looking for excuses to drive."
car_4088,Dream Car,"This is the funnest vehicle I have ever driven.  I love the way it takes curves on the highway and responds at the slightest touch on the accelerator.  It has more trunk space than I expected in a roadster.  It is also a ""head turner""!!!  I get compliments on it every where I go!!!!"
car_4089,Retirement Present,My wife's car and she loves it. Gives her the visibility she needs & loves the GO power. Surprisingly good gas mileage. She doesn't like the wheels so we are going to get rid of them.
car_4090,Janet's review,This car is wonderful. The car is really fun to drive and handles great.The power of the car is such fun.I get so many compliments when I drive the car. I have the launch edition.
car_4091,My Favorite Car of All Time!,"After 7 years driving my beloved Honda Del Sol, I had to think about buying a new car.  I researched for approximately a year and decided on the 350 SLK.  I bought this car in 05/05 and have enjoyed it so very much.  It's fun to drive, looks great, handles really well, and has a lot more power than the Del Sol (of course!). A friend asked me if I missed my Del Sol (that everyone knew I absolutely loved -- to the extent I wouldn't let anyone even drive it) -- and you know, I don't! It's much more quiet (from road noise) than any other roadster out there and has a lot more style and class.  M-B and the dealer give special attention to everything and to the customer.  A nice extra!"
car_4092,Thrilling Performance,"I had to wait 3 months for my SLK 350 to arrive from Germany but it was well worth the wait.  The SLK350 is quite a ride and has enough power to get you where you want to go.  The interior is well appointed and the air scarf in the seats is great. New music sound system is totally awesome!  This is my third Mercedez and I have not been disppointed.  The ease and handling of the SLK350 is smooth.  MBZ has a real winner with this new body style which is a real head-turner.  Can't go wrong with this SLK and even though it is somewhat pricey, it is well worth the investment"
car_4093,Nice Drive,"I agree with Edmunds on the pros, but not the cons.  You are getting much more car for the price than its peers and I find the blind spot negligible. I test drove the Lotus Elise and Boxter S. Both have slightly tighter suspensions. The Elise handling was amazing.  The Boxter has a horrible blind spot and the SLK interior is far superior to either, especially the Elise. The engine is spectacular, very smooth and great torque even at low RPM.  When I combined interior comfort, styling and the retractable hardtop, there was no question which car to buy. So far I haven't been let down.  The SLK is a blast to drive, the air scarf is fantastic.  Only regret, I didn't get the rain sensor wipers."
car_4094,Great Ride,"This is truly a fun car to drive. Great aceleration and handling. Will receive a plethora of looks while driving, especially with the top down. Have not experience any problems in the first two months."
car_4095,Great car,"I have owned 3 Porsches, and a Jag XKR and this by far beats them all.  When you consider price, styling, performance, and fun to drive I think this is the most balanced auto Mercedes- AMG makes."
car_4096,SLK 350,"So much fun to drive. It's fast, responsive, and a joy on country roads.  There are some blind spots you have to be careful of, and the seat isn't the best fit for my 5'2"" height, but they are a small price to pay for the fun!"
car_4097,Fun in the Sun,Great acceleration and smooth handling. Head-turning body design.  Quiet with the top up -- like driving a normal hard top car.
car_4098,Pure joy to drive.,"MB has a hit with the SLK.  It is a drop-dead gorgeous roadster that continues to draw stares from all types.  Last weekend, two Harley riders gave us a thumbs-up and mouthed ""nice car"" as we passed.  The quality is outstanding, both interior fit & finish, and exterior paint & wheels.  With the top up, the interior is as quiet as any car that I have owned. The trunk size is reasonable... two medium duffle bags and a 12 pack cooler provide plenty of room for a weekend getaway.  Mileage is 19 city & 24-25 hi-way.  Sometimes we think that we spent too much for this ""mid-life toy"" but then we take it for a quick drive and immediately change our minds.  This car is a true joy."
car_4099,Awesome - You owe it to yourself,"The car is one exceptional piece of automotive excellence. Aside from the obvious stunning looks , both exterior and interior, this is a driver's car. I find myself looking for longer ways to reach my destination. Very powerful motor, smooth transmission -it rockets once you put your foot on pedal. The Harmon Kardon Sound system , along with Sirius satellite radio is magnificent and sounds great. The hard top dropping into the trunk in under 20 seconds is something to watch. The comfort package is worth it. The air scarf is ingenious. When everything is said and done - this is truly a fun car to drive and the aesthetic appeal from both men and women is very evident. Great Car !"
car_4100,Mercedes-Benz Sportscar?,"I never thought I'd be saying Mercedes-Benz and sportscar in the same sentence. From the incredible power and torque of the engine, to the handing and the stop on a dime brakes, this car is a blast to drive. It's modern styling and comfort features set it appart from the competition"
car_4101,SLK55AMG,"When I was looking at cars I knew I wanted a convertible.  While the cost and performance of the Corvette was interesting, you see a boat-load of Corvettes on the road and I wanted something a little different.    It finally came down to a choice between the Lexus SC430 (great company/smooth quiet reliable car and also a hard-top convertable) vs. the SLK 55 AMG.  If I had chosen using my head, I would have gone with the Lexus.  The SLK had the performance and looks, but questionable reliability.  My heart won the battle.  So far I have not been disappointed."
car_4102,My dream car!!,"We are fighting over who gets to drive this car every day.  I think we are going to have to buy another one.   We truly love this car.  It's the best of both worlds, a sports car with luxury and class.  It gets more looks driving down the road than our Corvette.  You owe it to yourself to drive one if you are even considering a roadster."
car_4103,Fun Roadster,"Great looking car with the new exterior design. Some angles reflect an SL look. Interior is superb, and it is easy to see and adjust all components. Outstanding quality and performance is on the mark."
car_4104,2005 SLK--True Driver's Car,"Have had car for a little over a month with no problems whatsoever. Great fun to drive with easy to use top.  I live in Maine.  Air scarf is a great feature which allows for top down driving even when temperatures are the the 50's.  Cup holders are useless and there is not a lot of storage space or trunk space.  Buy this car for its looks and because it is fun to drive, not because it is pratical, which it isn't."
car_4105,I'm in love!,"The 350SLK is an absolute dream from the retractable roof, speed when you need it, a quiet ride, unbelievable sound system, and solid handling. And it's beautiful to look at. It could use more lockable space and the cup holders are in a strange spot, but all other amenities more than make up for the inconvenience."
car_4106,Heaven on Wheels,"I've owned my SLK 350 for 2 months now and I LOVE IT.  It not only has excellent performance, but it also handles the road beautifully.  The new body style is appealing, and life doesn't get much better than driving ""topless"" in the summer heat, by the lake, and taking it all in.  I highly recommend the Mercedes SLK 350."
car_4107,SLK55 AMG,"With a V8 and the styling of the $450,000 SLR, this little car is a blast. It is much more user friendly than last years SLK32 AMG and almost as fast. Everybody loves the car's sleek looks and impressive performance."
car_4108,Fun two seater,"This car is the most fun of any that I have owned.  Unlike the 2004 version (which I did not buy) I can actually fit comfortably driving this model (and I am 6'1"").  My only small complaint is that the legroom in the passenger seat is not as great as in the driver's seat.  Still, it is a hoot to drive, top up or top down.  It has excellent responsiveness, and is plenty fast with the basic six cylinder.  I would get it again in a heartbeat."
car_4109,Rush! Like no other.,"Awesome ride.  I took the car on a 900 mile trip (Avg. 25.6 mpg on highway w/ avg. speed of 68mph allowing for pit stops) and was concerned before I left  it might be uncomfortable for that long a ride, but at 6'2"" I felt totally at ease.  It has the horsepower to get out of the way and handling you would expect from a roadster.  Top speed electronically limited to 155mph."
car_4110,Love It!,"I have the limited edition for Breast Cancer - it was the right color, had the features I wanted and a donation to Breast Cancer is a bonus!  Love the performance of the car, love the look, and I'm even amazed at the size of the trunk. I'm getting about 20mpg around town and around 30mpg on long trips (all that with the way *I* drive!) The suspension is excellent. This car takes corners like you wouldn't believe.  Only minor negatives are related to the additional spoilers on the front. They look great, but it's VERY easy to bump them on inclined driveways. Also, first gear (manual shift, 6 gears) is VERY low.. good for starting on slopes, otherwise pretty much useless."
car_4111,New 350 SLK with 7 sp automatic,This is my first Mercedes car and I have been very pleased so far.  The seven speed automatic is a very good feature and allows you to pick the best gear for any situation.  The sport mode allows the driver to go close to red line and shifts faster than any manual.
car_4112,SLK55 AMG,"I have throughly enjoyed my driving experience so far.  It hugs the road and actually feels like a ""real"" sports car.  I am not a Mercedes fan but this car won me over.  I actually chose it over several other cars with much higher price tags.  My one complaint is the awkward placement of the cup holders.  Other than that, get the factory installed radar dectector, you're going to need it."
car_4113,Perfect,"More fun, sportier, firmer and better interior design than the pre-2005 SLKs.  The convertible hardtop remains the best feature and the heated ""windscarf"" is not just a new gadget.  It's heaven on a chilly drive."
car_4114,All new experience,"I traded the ""old"" version SLK in for a new 2005.  It's a night and day difference.  Acceleration is more than sufficient, the ride is smoother, the electronic additions are welcome, the look is current,...  Definetly worth consideration even if you live in snow country - just don't try to drive it in the snow!"
car_4115,350 SLK Major Upgrade,"Mercedes has scored a major hit with this upgrade to the SLK model. The styling is super sleek, especially the McLaren influenced nose. The interior is roomier than its predecessor and exudes a more luxurious,quiet and solid ""Mercedes"" like feel. Driving is a real pleasure with lots of torque and crisp acceleration helped out by the 7 speed automatic/""tiptronic"" capable transmission. It can scoot to 60mph in times close to that of the 500SL. I traded a much loved 350Z to get this car and its convertible hardtop, and in spite of its much higher price point, I believe it delivers more complete satisfaction."
car_4116,Awesome Hot Rod,"I picked up my new SLK 350 recently. The car is a huge improvement over its predecessor, often perceived as a girl's car. No guy will be ashamed to be seen sitting behind the '05 SLK. I test drove both the manual and automatic transmission. One car reviewer said no one will regret getting the stick shift, and I agree 100%. It is so much more fun to move the gears yourself, and you will save over $1000 at it since the 7 speed gear box is an option. The car has terrific acceleration, and it hugs the road so well, you wouldn't be afraid to navigate those winding turns at a fast speed. I recommend the zenon HID lights. It's gorgeous in the dark, and worth every penny. Standard sound system is also superb."
car_4117,Best car I've ever owned,"It turns heads, snaps your head back, and you can drive it in traffic all day and still have a smile on your face. It handles much better than the 2003 (I have one of those also) and the cockpit feels like a jet fighter. The trunk is larger, the transmission shifts wonderfully. It has no rattles at all, and when I brought it back for the free one-thousand mile checkup I had nothing to fix or adjust."
car_4118,Mid-Life Crisis Car-Youth Restored!,"This car is everything you'd expect a roadster to be! Feel, ride, performance, class--it's a trip to drive and own! This dealership treated me with respect and care, too. Not for the feint of heart or bench seat afficianado--this is a sports car and a load of fun!"
car_4119,Bang On!,"7 day owner. Top up looks great, better down. Few think it's a drop top until you show them. Several have guessed it must have cost over 80K. Snicker.  Power, Handling, Status, Comfort (I am 6'2"" 225). I tested a Porsche Box, Audi S4, and BMW 330. They just do not stack up against SLK 350. Interior is par excellance.  I live in flat Florida and find myself frequently going out of the way to find curves on back roads.  Radar Detector should come as standard equipment.  In sum, I am a discerning consumer. The desingers found a way to touch the human senses on many levels.  Many fellow drivers must feel the same was as I have noticed several jaws drops.  Go Mercedes!"
car_4120,Great Car,"This a car that is fun to drive and handles great. The hard top convertible is so nice, makes the car noise free when the hard top is up and is a lot of fun when its down. The new interior is a big improvement over the previous model."
car_4121,SLK 55 AMG,"My SLK55 is my first Mercedes-Benz.  It is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I paid $1,000 over MSRP for it.  There was an eight  week wait for car.  I would definately do it again.  Its fuel Economy is great for a 355 hp V-8, EPA 16 / 22.  On my last tank I averaged 22.8 mpg.  The car is solid, yet rides great for a sports car.  I really like the AMG improvements over the 350.  It turns this car into a monster (with monster looks)."
car_4122,The SLK 350 is an excellent car to own!,"The redesigned SLK 350 has a much improved interior and exterior compared to it's predecessor.  Excellent features to this car include the optional Harmon Kardon sound system, excellent safety features, stylish headlamps, heated seats, the new edition of an ""air scarf"" (which enables the driver to experience a comfortable temperature even with the roof down in cooler weather), and of course the retractable hardtop.  The car is very fun to drive, it handles the road with ease.  Execellent pick- up, with the car reaching 60 mph in under 5 seconds.  There is ample trunk space compared to competitor sports cars within this price class.  I highly recommend this car... it is very fun to drive!"
car_4123,The Ice Skate,"The new SLK takes your breath away when you first see it.  It has a sexy line and everyone notices it.  The front nose is gorgeous and the entire body is well proportioned.  It has great trunk space.  The interior is put together well and is user friendly.  Though small with limited cargo space, it still fits CD's, make-up, glasses, a cell phone, papers and even a visor and water bottle.  The cup holders are outstanding and very accessible from the driver's side.  The many features it offers are outstanding especially the auto lights, the seat adjustment when exiting and the auto convertible roof.  The acceleration is excellent and it handles like a dream.  It is a blast to drive."
car_4124,"The ""wow factor"" doesn't wear off.","Even at the base level, the car is well equipped.  There is plenty of room (I'm 6'-1""), and the car is quite practical from a comfort and cargo- carrying capacity standpoint.  The paint is stunning.  My Firemist Red causes long stares and compliments from everyone I encounter.  The chassis is stiff and feels light and sporty.  The incredible roadgrip is confidence-inspiring.  The interior finish is unique, durable, high- quality, and profoundly easy to case for.  I have the 7-speed automatic, and although I always buy manual, it's incredible and wouldn't trade it for anything.  Coupled with its broad torque curve, it's the closest thing to a turbine engine you'll find.  And, my God, is it fast"
car_4125,This car I'll keep!,"After enjoying (yawn) several years' driving the SLK 320, I could not resist the SLK 350 with its leaps and bounds improvements.  This vehicle is an altogether different animal than its predecessor (think cheetah rather than, say, tabby cat).  Opt for the manual transmission for an honest sports car experience (urban driving need not be an obstacle).           The MB SLK 350 is an agile, beautiful, and extremely comfortable ride."
car_4126,SLK-55,"This is a really fun car to drive. The first day I got it I could not stop flooring the accelerator. I would take this car over a SL-500 any day, maybe even a SL-55. The handling is impeccable. It's seen every time you take a turn, you're tempted to kick the rear out a little bit. I dont like the fact that its not a True 5.5 liter engine. It's a 5.4 liter. However, I do love the brakes. When doing all this speeding, it's a must to have good brakes. The interior is superb. If you ever sat in an AMG sport seat you would know how great that feel is."
car_4127,Excellent AMG,"Test drove 2005 Vette - no comparision.  Benz is much better build and trim level.  Great exhaust note.  Cannot compare SLK 350 to 55, have driven both.  Not one complaint about this car.  Best car I ever owned.   Paid $ 1,000 over MSRP & waited 8 weeks for car.  I would do it in a heartbeat all over again.  Fuel Economy scored 9, but is what you expect from 355+ hp, AMG is thirsty."
car_4128,"Now, they got it right!","Mercedes finally made over the SLK into a true sports car. Great pickup power, smooth new 7 speed automatic overpowers the stick! More roomy than the former design. Exterior looks are outstanding. Picked mine up in Europe and loved its performance on the Autobahn. SL fans, try this one for size and pocket $40,000!"
car_4129,A great new model worth every penny,"Although I have only had the car for two months, it is a fantastic sports car. Although my previous car, the BMW M Roadster (which I loved) may have had a little more power, this car is better built, (finally no squeaks) has more great features and is an all around great ride.  I loved my M but this is an incredible car, and the standard 6 speed is the best. It turns heads everywhere I go due to the great new design, and blows away most other cars on the highway. This is truly the best new car on the road, and Mercedes has hit a home run. It's not the Barbie doll car anymore."
car_4130,My Dream Car,"Since I was a teenager working at a local Mercedes dealer in NY, I promised myself that one day I would walk in and buy one. Well my dream became reality a few weeks ago when I took delivery of my new 350SLK. It is visually stunning and more fun to drive then any car I have ever owned. The rush of the wind with the top down and the Florida sun shining down is fantastic."
car_4131,Sweet,"I owned a 2003 320 SLK for the past few years.  A great car, but the 350 SLK is light years ahead of it.  Less side torsion for one.  Handling is without question better..big upgrade.   Instrumentation is spectactular by comparison.  Similar in layout, but the it's like going from old school to the real deal.  I wouldn't trash the 2003..it was beautiful...but this turns heads like you cannot believe...almost embarassing."
car_4132,Comfort+speed=FUN,"The SLK 350 combines a great daily driver with sufficient sport qualities and comfort to make the ride to work (70 mi. ) a pleasure. It has more than adequate power to cruise ahead of the pack and luxurious enough to prevent fatigue on long trips. With the top up it's as solid as any other Benz, top down - who cares about  being anywhere else, in anything else. Gas mileage has averaged 23."
car_4133,Best car I have ever owned!,"This car is a blast to drive. The handling is outstanding and gives the phrase ""hugs the road"" new meaning. The wind shield and air scarf allow you to drive with the top down when most others cannot."
car_4134,My Bonus,"Just drove home my new AWESOME SLK. I love the look of the car, especially the front! The hardtop glides back so gracefully. My black leather interior looks great with the silver/chrome color dash, very high tech!  The 7 speed is fun to drive and a great option, excellant power (more fun than my CLK). The heating package with the airscarf is a must, especially when you are zooming around with the top down. A great value for the money and LOOKS AWESOME!"
car_4135,A fun car to drive,"This is a sporty upscale convertible which with the hardtop up acts like a sedan.  Never short on power, it handles like a true sports car.  Cargo space slim with top down but can accommodate a couple of small suit cases with the top up."
car_4136,Great car,"Had it for 1700 miles and loving it more every day.  Tight suspention is great for hard driving, but can become a bit painful for the daily commute."
car_4137,I thought my SLK230 was sweet!,More sleek and aerodynamic than previous model. Much faster acceleration from stop; incredible interior dash/seat design; superior Harmon Kardon stereo system;light & premium stereo package well worth the money. Turns a lot of heads everywhere I go.
car_4138,Art on wheels !,"Merecedes has taken an ""ok"" model and really spruced it up. The look is super, engine is amazing and interior classy. The design changes are stunning and they have really come up with a sports car. The SLK is one of the best designs of any sports car and the performance is equally top notch. The attention to detail, standard for MBZ, has been great in the re-design of this model."
car_4139,SLK Hottie!,"We are returning owners of MBZ.  We 
just love the models after the new body 
design change. And this one has no 
doubt been an eye catcher!  
The redesigned size of the car is much 
better. My husband is 6' and fits 
comfortably."
car_4140,Awesome perfection!,"The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 is not a hairdresser's car by any means.  Make sure that you order this car with the ""airscarf"" feature allowing one to retract the hard top in colder weather. This will reveal the symphonic sound of the normally aspirated 8-cylinder engine.  The hand-built engine (0-60 in four and a half seconds), and other  AMG goodies make this car worth the $15,000 surcharge over the SLK350. The car is standard Mercedes fare, quiet and vault-like. Its only problem is, AMG doesn't make a standard transmission."
car_4141,Great Ride,"Great car looks sporty and is! Cant 
wait until summer."
car_4142,My SLK 350 stinks!,"I've purchased this new SLK 350 long 
before any other dealers has it in 
stock.  The car was a lot smaller than 
I expected.  The engine has not enough 
power unlike the S class.. It feels 
more like a Chrysler crossfire than a 
Mercedes!  in 2 months I had to take 
it back to dealer 6 times to replace 
parts.   Worst quality luxury car ever!"
car_4143,2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK350 - Pros and Cons of Old vs. New,"I previously owned a 2002 Mercedes-Benz
SLK230.  My new 2005 SLK350 is a great 
improvement in many ways, mostly due to 
the design improvements.  The exterior 
is much more sleek, though I'm not 
crazy about the back end of the car.  
The car is wider, and a taller person 
can fit in it more easily now.  The 
cheesiness of the interior has been 
eradicated.  The interior looks much 
more elegant.  The unfortunates are the 
seats and the stereo.  I don't feel the 
seats are as comfortable as the earlier 
model, and I think the stereo has a 
lower quality sound.  However, the pros 
far outweigh the cons, and after having 
this car for nearly two months, I like 
it much better than my old version."
car_4144,2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK350 - A Powerful Ride,"The Mercedes-Benz SLK350 is quite
an improvement over the SLK230! 
This car has power to spare, rides 
tight to the road and acceleration over 
the entire rpm range. I've tested the 
Z3 and Z4 and there is no comparison. 
It is as fine a car as the SL500 and at 
half the cost. Mercedes has a winner in 
the new 350 engine."
car_4145,SUPER CAR,"This is A true sports car,I got the SLK 
350 up to highway speeds so quickly,I'd
only gone through A couple of the six
manual gear,I could have easily kept 
going,IT Just didn't feel as if the car 
was traveling that fast."
car_4146,My little peice of HEAVEN!,Great reviews except for the gas mileage you get and with gas prices sky rocketing thats the only complaint we have on the car.  We had the lighting package added and love the brightness of the headlights you get with the Xenon but still trying to figure out the cornering lights.  I guess its kinda strange to see a little light come on and then go off after a turn.  Just hope that they dont burn out quickly.  Love the neck scarf even with the top up so I'm sure its going to work wonders with the top down since the bay area doesn't get that awsome down south sun.  The Navigation is going to take some time to work out since I'm so use to the touch screen I guess I will have to thumb around.
car_4147,This is true sports car,"I bought the first new design of 2005 
SLK 350 MB the first week of 
october.This is A true sports car,I 
discovered I'd only gone through A 
couple of the six manual gear.I could 
how easily kept going,it just didn't 
feel as if the car was taveling that 
fast.I'm surprise how powerful and fun 
to drive this car."
car_4148,SLK 350,"Phenomenal car to both drive and look 
at! Great combination of high-
performance sports car and luxury 
vehicle. Super fast!"
car_4149,SLK350WRM,"Outstanding quality, performance and 
just a lot of fun to drive. High value 
for the money."
car_4150,Mercedes got it right !,"I also own an SLK320, and the SLK350 is 
light years ahead of the 320.  The 
engine is smooth and the power comes 
early and just keeps on coming.  
Passing power is awesome.  The interior 
features make this look like a mini-SL 
for $40K less.  The car is a blast to 
drive and the airscarf extends top-down 
driving well into the Autumn."
car_4151,SLK COMFORT AND STYLE,"I JUST BOUGHT THE SLK 350. IT HAS 
EXCELLENT POWER, GREAT INTERIOR AND 
RIDES FINE.
THE TOP IS SO EASY TO PUT UP AND DOWN.
I HAVE HAD JAGUARS, PORCHE, CORVETTES-
THISIS THE BEST"
car_4152,I got lucky,"Had car on order with another 
dealership and was told I would not get 
one until November or December.  My car 
came open at another dealer and I was 
driving on September 3rd, 2 days after 
the car was introduced.  My car has the 
comfort package, heating package and 
premium package with the 7 speed 
automatic.  The car feels great and 
runs great.  We just got back from a 
weekend trip and were able to fit all 
of our luggage in the trunk with the 
top down.  Tre trunk has room for golf 
clubs and minor luggage."
car_4153,Good looking car but very expensive to maintain,This car is one of the best looking cars on the road.   Performance is good for the V6 models but mine is a 4 cylinder and the performance is only OK.   Interior is very nice but the weak points is the electronics that fail frequently.   Gas mileage is poor for a small car with a 4 cylinder engine.   Recommend the car for sunny day short drives but take the big car on trips.
car_4154,Sizzling Car,"This car has been my Wonderful Wife's primary car for about 12 years.She purchased it used with low mileage (15k) & used it 5-6 days a week to travelapproximately 100 miles a day. She Loved the car yes I say loved it.   Recently on her way home from work while thankfully close to home the her trusty Chariot stalled & failed to restart. When I arrived I attempted to restart the car & received aCrank no start condition. We had the vehicle towed home & I began a 12 day journey toReignite the stalled steed. Well unfortunately after diagnosing (using a code reader &addressing the specific codes) the condition & changing several small items: gas cap, air filter, spark plugs, camshaft monitor, crankshaft monitor &checking all the fuses & a k40 computer board: I finally relinquished control & had OurMechanic to save the day. Unfortunately he couldn't either. He decided to check the engine compression with two different meters and found little or no compression in all 4 cylinders.      The only maintenance that was performed on the car in five years & 149k has been oil/filterchanges & tires. This car was so reliable that even when it took its last breath it did so,Close to home & not strand my Wife in the boonies. My recommendation check the manufacturer's suggested timing chain interval &you will have a fun little ride for a long time."
car_4155,Good Weekend Fun Car,"My wife and I purchased our SLK 32 last year as a fun car.Being a 11 yr old car, we use it about 5-7K miles a year driving it on nice days.So far we have been pleased with this car.The only negative issue is the center console being scratched up and worn. Otherwise a really clean car."
car_4156,I love my SLK,"I thought a review of a 6 year old SLK320 might be helpful to people. All of the '98 to '02 SLK's had an issue with paint peeling on the center console. Other than that my SLK looks like it rolled off the assembly line yesterday. I have never seen a car that has aged this well, bar none. Outside paint still lives up to its name 'Brilliant Silver'. Everything about the car is tight and solid. My last car was a Corvette so I am not new to performance cars and this one is a winner. No, it doesnt have the off the line grunt of a Corvette. It is more along the lines of european sports cars, in other words spectacular handling, very good road manners and comfort levels and exciting top end speed."
car_4157,SLK32 AMG,"I love this car.  It's addictive to drive, and the power is awesome.  Concerns about acceleration are never an issue.  The interior looks a little old, and not all that expensive.  The CD changer (which is an option) skips if you hit a pothole and the ride translates uneven road surfaces. But this is a sports car, so you should expect that.  The car feels well built and drives wonderfully.  The only thing I dont like about the cars driving dynamics would be the steering.  It's a bit clunky, and isn't as precise as it should be.  The steering wheel is also a little big, and doesnt tilt. It's a great car, if you want something that can take on a Corvette, and that is understated."
car_4158,MB SLK great Car,"I owned a Mazda Miata prior to this Mercedes and worried about the reliability of this vehicle. However, the car has been great and I now have almost 50,000 miles on it and it is a pleasure to drive and fun when top is down on a nice day. I love the fact that the roof is solid and that I don't have to worry about the snow causing any damage to the interior. The car is also great in snow with the snow tires that I purchased only a few months after I fist got the car. All in all, I would say that I love this car and that it has served me quite well."
car_4159,Beautiful  Lines,"This is my third MB and the nicest looking by far.  I bought it basically for the ease of the retractable hardtop.  The trunk is small, but adequate for trips to the grocery store.  I would rather have a single disc CD player than the optional 6 disc in the trunk.  Pickup is not as responsive as the 230SLK supercharged which I previously owned.  I like the interior features better on the 320 though, with the wood grain treatments.  Definitely not a family car, just a fun short trip vehicle.  Gets about 18 miles per gallon with city driving and 29 miles per gallon exclusively highway.  Great car for me, but I only do about 5K a year."
car_4160,Not as Happy,"I leased this car brand new in 2002.  The second month I had it I had to take it back to the dealer to get the driver door replaced due to a faulty seal, which did not allow the door to close properly.  At 40,000 miles, the motor mounts collapsed and one of the cams had to be replaced.  Had to replace at least 6 brake lamps.  Twice the convertible top got stuck when trying to let it down. Was told this happens when you use it for the first time after winter.  Cupholders broke soon after I got it.  The check engine sensor had to be replaced at least 3 times.  Warranty is running out, so I am turning it in at the end of the lease."
car_4161,WOW! Still in Love!,"This car is solid in construction and road feel. I have owned it since it had 12,000 miles on the odometer.  I replaced the rear tires after 13,000 miles, the fronts after 21,000 miles. I love the acceleration. This supercharged V6 gives pure fun! The brakes are awsome (still original). Going 80mph you won't even feel the road.  Did I mention that I drive mostly with top down?  In a nutshell, this baby flies and looks good doing it with low maintenance. 21 mpg average! Buy one and live a dream!"
car_4162,Room for Two,"My 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK320 is just plain fun!  Its acceleration is more than adequate, it won't beat a Porsche Boxster but it'll get you excited.  Putting the roof up or down is a breeze - just click & hold the button.  Once the roof is up it's as solid as a regular hardtop, no shimmy.  This car is relatively quiet though noise from the rear tires can be loud with the roof up.  Its exhaust note is a nice throaty roar.  The engine sounds great when wound up.  This car always draws looks and positive comments from all age groups.  It is very noticeable and unique."
car_4163,EXCELLENT!!!,"I love this car!!! drives smooth, 
accelerates great, beautiful to look 
at, quick hardtop, HUGE TRUNK SPACE 
for this type of car"
car_4164,SLK32 AMG Rocks!,"I have had this car almost 2 years and 
I love it. It has phenomenal power, 
brakes, and suspension. The folding top 
is a work of art, but limits trunk 
space significantly. One trip to the 
dealer so far, for headlight 
adjustment. All maintenance done at 
home. This car should have come with a 
1 disc CD, but didn't. I didn't buy the 
$2K car phone. (Duh!) No complaints."
car_4165,2002 Mercedes SLK 320,"Beautiful vehicle with luxurious interior and 
nimble, quick ride.  Great open air 
convertible that feels like a solid sedan 
when the retractable hard top is up."
car_4166,"Great Car, Mediocre Service","This is a great car overall... It's 
gets plenty of attention & looks 
great.. It is also fun to drive, 
especially in te Spring/Summer with the 
hardtop down."
car_4167,"Still a thrill ride, two years later","Such a joy every time you step on the 
gas.  Drive it like it's an amusement 
park ride, drive it to get groceries 
with your mother-in-law, either way it 
performs nicely.  I never thought I'd 
like an automatic, but they did such a 
nice job with this transmission: you 
can still accelerate while it's 
downshifting."
car_4168,Solid Convertable at any speed,"I have now had this car two years. 
Very few issues, solid car with the 
hard top convertable up or down. Blast 
to drive, plenty of power in the 
SLK320."
car_4169,RED BULLET,"SLK32 AMG IS A GREAT CAR!  MORE FUN TO 
OWN THAN I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED.  
I LIVE ABOVE 5,000 FT AND THE 
SUPERCHARGER ALLOWS THE CAR TO PERFORM 
LIKE IT IS AT SEA LEVEL.  THE AMG 
BRAKES, TRANSMISSION AND STEERING TAKE 
THE STANDARD SLK TO A HIGHER LEVEL"
car_4170,Aw..,it it sooo wonderful... buy buy buy!!!
car_4171,Best Lil Convertible in NC,"I find this to be a wonderful car to 
drive. Handling and performance top 
notch. I am a single woman and the 
safety features in this car are 
exceptional. It is fun to drive and  
seeing people's expressions when I 
drive by. Exceptional automobile."
car_4172,htslk32,"This car is a mini-rocket.  Head 
snapper and eye turner.  Get lots of 
questions and curious lookers.  Fast, 
handles great.  Pleasure to drive.  Low 
profile and small cockpit makes it a 
bit harder for a tall person to get in 
and out.  Very small trunk, barely room 
for set of clubs and shoes.  Dispite a 
few issues, very pleased.  If had it to 
do over, would buy it again."
car_4173,Silver Bullet!,"Great acceleration.  Hard top 
security.  Nimble size.  Handsome 
design.  Decent fuel economy.  The 
SLK32 meets my criteria for a fun and 
(somewhat) practical sports car.  It 
may not have the handling of a Porsche 
C4S nor speed of a TVR but for everyday 
driving it more than keeps your heart 
racing.  Stomping on the accelerator at 
60 mph results in instant torque and 
before you know it -- triple digits!"
car_4174,SLK 32,"An extraordinary vehicle.    Performed 
well at Mid-Ohio track - competes well 
with the 911s.  The car was a 
compromise with my wife who does not 
like to shift."
car_4175,Wonderful Hardtop,"You can surprise everyone with the 
vario hardtop which is rarely seen.  
The little SLK makes a great 
stablemate with any cars you could 
have.  8.7 cb.ft. trunk gives you 
twice as much space as Z3 could 
offer.  This SLK is the way to go!  If 
I had more money, I would go for the 
SLK32 AMG!"
car_4176,"Fun Car , but problems","I had mine special ordered with manual 
transmission and xenon head lights. 
The car is a lot of fun to drive, 
accelerates well and corners extremely 
well.
About 3 months into driving the car, 
the transmission fluid leaked causing 
the car to suddenly jerk forward 4 
feet , fortunately no one was injured. 
Now, after 8000 miles the 
airconditioning fan gave out and need 
another trip to the dealer!"
car_4177,A fun car to drive!!!,"You are always in control of this 
vehicle.  I have had this vehicle to 
130 MPH and felt in control the whole 
time.  It takes curves with grace and 
style."
car_4178,SLK - A Total Winner w/Great Value,"The SLK230 is not only a beautiful car 
with the top up or down, but has more 
driving fun than any car I've owned.  
The supercharger is the 
secret...building up torque and speed 
on a light, nimble chassis.  Feels like 
it is on rails...and solid as a rock, 
no rattles, no squeeks, everything 
works perfectly after many bumps and 
potholes in San Francisco and through 
the wine country.  Get one!  It is a 
steal at the price they are asking.  
And the resell is excellent.  And 
you'll love the cup holder..best in 
class."
car_4179,Mercedes does not live up to it's name,"Talk about a piece of junk.  I've owned
one for a little over a year and it's
been in the shop so many times I've lost
count.  I thought I could count on
Mercedes producing a car worth 52k but
my expectations have fallen far short. 
Now that it's nice and hot my regulator
and fan motor decided not to work.  Just
the latest in a string of things that
have had to be repaired.  I'd say they
must have learned from Chrysler how to
build a cheap car but the Jeep Wranger I
traded in for this never went into the
shop for the two years I owned it."
car_4180,What a car,"What a great car.  Great performance 
and very eye catching.  Hardtop 
convertible is an amazing piece of 
engineering.  AMG package makes a real 
difference."
car_4181,Amazing,"I just bought this car and it is truely 
amazing to look at.  It is sporty with 
the roof up and then when it goes down 
it looks like the hottest car on the 
road.  The quality of the car is 
amazing and the fun you have in it 
makes it all worth it."
car_4182,A Dream to Drive,"Awesome car!  Only 400+ miles so far, but what great performance!  
Handles the curves perfectly and is much more nimble than my 560SL.  
Powerful and smooth to drive."
car_4183,Lots of fun for the buck...,"Just bought my SLK320.  I've owned 5 
SLs before this car, most recently a 
1998 SL500.  The SLK320 is much more 
fun to drive than any previous SL!  It 
feels just as powerful as the SL500, 
but its handling is MUCH more 
responsive, nimble, sporty, and quick. 
Front suspension is perfect; feels more 
like a Porsche or BMW.  Rear suspension 
is a little stiff & bumpy, but 
tolerable.  Audio system could be 
better.  Crossover frequency between 
sub-woofer and door speakers is wrong.  
Mid-bass is missing, making some CDs 
sound harsh and ""thin"".  Other than 
that...the SLK320 is a blast!  
Automatic transmission is very 
intuitive.  I was skepitcal about 
the ""touch shift""....but it works very 
well."
car_4184,A REAL FUN CAR,"Only own this car for 10 days and already think it is a great vehicle.It   is goodlooking,powerful and a pleasure to drive and park.I agree the cruise control lever should be moved farther away from the turn selector lever.Why not on the other side of the steering column? One note of caution to fellow    golfers--you can only squeeze your golf bag in the trunk with the irons in the bag.The driver and fairway woods have to be stowed behind the front seats,they are too long for the small trunk space.  I guess everything has its price !"
car_4185,SLK230,"Awesome vehicle.  Attention getter.  
Very fun to drive.  However, faulty 
paint job I believe causing my paint to 
chip."
car_4186,Dream Car for under $60k,"Best car I have ever owned (out of 48). 
I am a car enthusiast and the last 4 
sportcars were 00 Vette, 00 Boxster, 01 
S2000, 01 Boxster S.  SLK32 has better 
acceleration than vette, with Boxster 
handling, and S2000 fun w/tiptronic 
shift and ESP control. Boxsters were 
slow, Vette had heavy feel and poor 
visibility, S2000 loud and clutch 
slipped. SLK32 0-60 time of 4.6 secs.  
Cabin is awesome with Bose system and I 
fit well(6' 3"").  Xeon headlights are 
awesome.  Ride is smooth and silky.  
Visibility best for convertable-due to 
wide rear window and small roof 
pillars.  Car exceeded all expectations"
car_4187,Pretty good in general,Best buy in terms of money in this catagory.
car_4188,A great car to own and driv,"I haven't had any quality issues with the car.  Its a real attention getter, lots of people ask about the car.  Its the most enjoyable car I have ever owned.  You get the best of both worlds convertible and hard top."
car_4189,Fun to the MAX,"I like this car, very fun to drive. Great folding hard top.  Love it with the top down.  Great Acceleration. Handling is fun.  It rides well and is quiet for a small sports car. This car gets a lot of attention, everyone asks me about it."
car_4190,Driving a Dream,"Never was a Mercedes fan, but this car is pure pleasure.  Stunning visually, yes; superb engineering, of course.  But it's the driving experience that makes this a wonderfully special vehicle."
car_4191,Edmunds and Carfax excellent research tools,get the Carfax report
car_4192,Amazing vech again by mercedes,have money
car_4193,Blue tec crazy,I did put larger tires on ..not run flates   for better ride and handling My car is 2014 not a 2015 just love it
car_4194,Bad Rap,"If you think that another suv with the stated purpose of luxury hauling of a couple of people on vacation or not really vigorous living, is better - then you are dreaming.  Who really cares about the people riding in the back seat - I have a sedan for that.  The cargo space is fine - an imperceptable difference to the competition.  Simply a great car that does what it is supposed to do - especially if you get the distrionic plus, active lane assist and the rest of the works.  How can anyone complain about this vehicle."
car_4195,Little Black Beauty,"Car runs great! Great gas mileage, trunk space has plenty of room. We use this car to run around town and cart 2 kids around to sports activities. Its much easier to park than our GL450 and the backup camera is really nice. The front console is designed so you can put your cell phone in it and it will not slide around. The only negative remarks I have  is in the back seat the cup holder is very cheaply made, nothing too heavy can go in it or it will break. The other is the moon roof cover is made of cheap fabric and prefer the solid look and feel of the GL450 model moon roof. The leather also doesn't seem to feel as nice as the GL450. Other than that, I feel the price we paid for a Mercedes out ways the other cars we had looked at (Subaru Outback, BMW X3, & Infiniti FX35."
car_4196,LOVE it!,"Purchased in December of 2013. Since then, we now have 9,200 miles on her. It's great! 

Love the look of it. Aggressive for a smaller SUV.  AND the comfort of it! 

Options are great. EXCEPT the stock GPS sucks. It can't find it's way out of a paper bag. AND, for it's cost, there should be more (Standard) options. AND the iPod station keeps forgetting that it's plugged in. A back up monitor, better GPS ($3000 option) and tilting mirrors would be groovy standard.

Not a lot of room for stuff and the dog."
car_4197,GLK350,Bought the car for the name only.
car_4198,Most Excellent!,"The GLK is exactly what I was looking for. A lot of the SUV's out there today are nothing more than mini-vans designed to appeal to male drivers. That being said, I purchased the GLK for two reasons: performance and quality. The GLK moves; it's nimble, deceivingly quick (when in sport mode) and it holds corners very well. The paddle shifters are awesome! The exterior has very distinct, bold lines and the interior is luxury as it should be. If you have need for more cargo room than a sedan, but don't want sacrifice performance... the GLK is for you. Oh, and it's a Mercedes- German engineering. Need I say more?"
car_4199,Amazing Fuel Effieciency!!,"I bought my GLK 350 base 2014 model back in August 2013 for 36k. I have driven around 2500 miles. So far i have not found any issues with the vehicle. Smooth ride, negligible noise while driving. Two important features that i liked the most. 1) It has two modes, ECO/Sport. In ECO mode, when stop at a light, engine stops and saves gas. 2) while stopping at a light uphill, you can just take your legs off from the brake. I was surprised at its fuel efficiency. It gives 24 mpg for city and over 31 for highway.For a V6, what else you can hope for!!!"
car_4200,great roadster,"Love driving this car, I have two 3 series BMWs, but this convertible is great fun to drive."
car_4201,Great car,"I love this car.  It is a great ride and so much fun to drive.  It is powerful enough and wants to go faster than the speed limit will allow me to drive; I feel in complete control of the car.  It still drives almost as good as it did 10 years ago.  The trunk holds more than you would think.  I am short, so it is a great fit.  Everything else I drive falls short. I will keep this car for as long as possible.  If you want a sports car that is a joy every time you get in it and one that still turns heads, I can highly recommend this one."
car_4202,Live a little!,"Climbing into a SLK is empowering one to cruise under the sun or in the rain with grace and style. Seating just two people this  makes for an intimate encounter for a couple on a trip or night out. It is an upscale convertible with a hardtop neatly tucked away for open air cruise or engaged overhead for the more climate controlled person. Enjoying the feel of the road through great road handling ability and the minimum effort to steer this ride is very enjoyable.  This is a great roadster for the price and mileage. Maintenance of this car is highly recommended to be maintained. As with all cars, the better you take care of it the longer it will last. This car is eye catching during a beach cruise or even a highway cruise. No need to speed to enjoy the power of this vehicle. Power seems to be at the fingertips for everything this little roadster provides. Recommend anyone interested to try various years and trim models to find the right one for yourself. I prefer the 2005 to 2011 body style which has a more sloping front end versus the boxy looking style introduced in 2012."
car_4203,98  mercedes slk,"Have never had any mechanical issues. Drove it in east coast city traffic and the mountains in colorado- handled roads great and heated seats with convert top down were a luxury. Bought it because of the retractable roof- the SLK was the  first convertible to do this and I never had a problem with it. have owned several other Mercedes from sedans to SUVs and this was definitely the most fun to drive, body style looked great ten years latter, paint held up- silver, but the interior was starting to wear- florida heat may have been a factor- the red paint on the dash and console was starting to melt and peel. So, with regrets I just traded it in. Other than routine maintenance no major repairs."
car_4204,Fun Car,Fun Car
car_4205,Fun Fun Fun,I got this car for my high school graduation. It is so much fun to drive. It accelerates great especially when in the 4th mode. Mine is bright yellow and it turns heads both when the top is up and down. The power hard top keeps the car cooler and warmer and takes only 30 seconds to come up/down. The sound system is superb and the heated seats are nice. Everything is great about it. It is far better than any other roadster. A must!
car_4206,SLK280,"I bought the car new.  Love it and still do.  However, there is a command center issue that apparently Mercedes can't identify..but whatever it is, it drains the battery when the car sits for lest than a week without being driven.  Now it appears that it takes 24hrs or less for it to drain without driving.  Mercedes can't seem to figure out what the problem is but I suspect it has always been an issue."
car_4207,SLK Fever,This car is really fun to drive.  It is very fast and corners incredibly.  The only small drawback is it is a bit tight inside.  I love this car!  It gets great gas mileage and has wonderful snob appeal!
car_4208,Rain back washes into electrical when battery clogged. Hole too small! Defective!,"Defect w/battery. The rain overflows fm the right side, into the battery box. There is a tiny hole for the rain to exit. The hole gets clogged up causing the rain water to back up into the electrical. Ruined A/C, Heat, cruise control, radio, etc. A total nightmare. I pushed the little black rubber stopper in & don't have the problem anymore. This is a manufacturer defect. Cost me thousands. The front bumper is also defective. 9 out of 10 are cracked. 1. It's too low 2. It's too flimsy. 3. It's high enough to scrape the top of a yellow cement parking block.Hello!Now that USA owns MB... starting to turn into crap!"
car_4209,Great Car,The dependability and performance of the car is nothing less than perfect. It looks good and the auto-top is wonderful with no rattles or problems
car_4210,Best Bang for your Buck!,"The SLK55 AMG has to be one of the best values in a sports car. Considering that most used 05-08 SLK55's are under $30K, that is an unbelievable value considering the technology, performance and amenities if offers. Mine is getting up there in mileage, but the performance and engine are rock solid, reliable and I've had no issues whatsoever. I really can't think of another car in this price range that turns as many heads, is as much fun to drive and feels as nice as this car. This could be your only car - it's plenty comfortable, and spacious if you're not carrying cargo much. Fuel mileage is pretty bad, but worth it for the great performance."
car_4211,Marginal reliability,"My friend and I both bought SLK's in 98 and had similar experiences with reliability issues.The top sometimes jams in a partially open/closed condition, tail lights have a propensity to melt, and the interior side panels were replaced twice under warranty due to separtation of the vinyl from the cardboard backing. Otherwise, the car is a blast to drive and really handles like a sports car. The seats initially feel like boards, but after a few minutes, they actually fell quite comfortable. Lots of power, and reasonable fule mileage, though it requires premium."
car_4212,The Ultimate Performance,"I have had multiple BMWs and an Audi, but nothing performs like this car.The acceleration (and exhaust sound) and handling is awesome.If you can hang on, no corner is too fast. I put Michelin PS2s on and the handling (and red smoothness) is even better.I have 23k miles on mine and not a problem. I have finally found a car that drives/performs as well as it looks.I just hope MB is still making these when I replace this one!"
car_4213,Fun little bling-bling car,"C'mon, an automatic retractable hard-
top convertible! Plus, the rear glass 
is REAL glass. Many don't realize that 
ALL SLKs are convertibles...they're not 
dimes a dozen! Lots of roar under the 
hood. You can imagine how much zang 
that engine hauls. Its simple elegance 
of being a convertible hard-top just 
brings it into a class of its own. The 
top is ingeniously tucked away in the 
trunk with the simple tug of a switch.  
Fun and great for petite females like 
me, I don't have a clue why guys would 
try to stuff themselves in small sports 
cars. I'd advocate it as a chicks' 
car...surely."
car_4214,Put zing into your life!,"I am 56, no I  am not having a midlife crisis.  But I did need a little zing , so i found the most perfect car to ram rod around in. I really love my car, It is fun, you get the looks, you feel like a million bucks, and the 06, was very reasonably priced. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
car_4215,Used SLK 230,"I just recently purchased this car 
from a dealership with less than 26000 
miles on it. Superb looks and a 
powerful engine. It drives like a 
dream and I am happy with it. The only 
thing I dont like about this car is 
its interior. The interior is made out 
of cheap plastic which is very un-
expected of Benz. This car could have 
had a little more space which would 
have really helped since I am an above 
average build person."
car_4216,Great Car!,"This is a great car.  Bought it used with under 15K miles, get better than rated mpg, quick, solid, turns heads, loads of fun convertible hard-top design is awesome."
car_4217,The best ride of my life,"I was lucky enough to buy this car off 
lease from one of my co-workers. I love 
the way it rides and handles the road. 
I can't believe how enjoyable driving 
has become since buying this car. My 
friends and family rave about it after 
riding in it."
car_4218,Looks fast and is!,"Bought this car used with 12K miles on it. My previous car was a BMW M3.  This car blows away the M3.  The handling is unbelievable and accelerator very responsive.  The 7- speed manual mode shifting is fun, but use the automatic when every day commuting.  I can't say enough good things about this car.  It's performance is as good as its looks!"
car_4219,Quick on the Draw,"Great car - responsive, quick, head 
turner.  Not in love with red and black 
interior - great on curves."
car_4220,Perfect Convertible Except...,"I test drove the Z4, Audi TT, and Miata, but found the SLK to be the best balance of practicality and fun. I love the way it corners while still eating bumps with the standard Mercedes THUD (this is my 3rd Mercedes). I think it has the best, most organic curves of the contemporary two seaters, plenty of power, firm but comfortable seats, and enough room for two weekend bags. My only gripe - and it's a big one - is the rattles and squeaks. I drove 3 SLKs and they all produced noises over bumps. I think it's a side effect of the hard top."
car_4221,Excellent Car,"I love this car!  From day one, I fell 
in love with the way it looks and 
drive.  This is one car that is 
definately all fun to drive.  If you 
need a business car that makes you look 
great, this is it."
car_4222,I LOVE this car!,I bought this car because I had always wanted a convertible.  What a great first convertible experience!  This car turns heads everywhere I go.  The pick-up is great!  The fuel economy listed is less than the 25mpg I've been averaging.  It handles really well no matter where you may be.  Great for sharp turns or straight roads.
car_4223,Awsome,"I just traded in my 1998 SLK 230 for a 
2002 S500.  The SLK is one of the 
nicest cars of all time"
car_4224,Nice convertible,"We purchased this as a 3rd car, primarily for weekend use, but I find myself driving it evenings also, just tooling around.  It's a blast, drives great, turns heads with the top up or down (and especially when it is being retracted). Solid engine, perfect ""rumble,"" seats are comfortable, great stereo, nice handling, etc.  It is a great-looking car, and a lot of fun!"
car_4225,"Some Good, Some Bad","It is what it is. Fun to drive, love the
hard top convertible, great handling,
expensive to maintain.  I have had the
following done (all under warranty):
both rear lamps replaced 2x, hardtop
realignment, transmission stuck in
first, inside right door panelling
redone, window mechanism broken.  Seems
like a lot for a Mercedes."
car_4226,Perfection,"I really love this car.  I also own a 2004 SLK 230.  All the issues I hated about the SLK 230 have been fixed with this new generation.  Car does not hunt the road  on rutted highways anymore, smoother ride.  This car will get 27 mpg if you behave yourself.  I can't say more about how much I love this one.  This is my fourth MB and so far it is the best one."
car_4227,Real world roadster,"I bought my SLK in June of '98 and plan 
to keep it a long time as a weekend 
car. Performance is fine, handling is 
simply outstanding. The hardtop has 
been trouble free so far -- one 
adjustment in 2000. California traffic 
is heavy, so the 5-sp auto is the way 
to go. Luggage space with the top up is 
cavernous -- much better than Z3, 
Boxster, S2000. Most important, the car 
stands out -- there are tons of 
Z3/Boxsters in Southern CA, but SLK is 
rarer. If buying a used one check 
maintenance recs -- any Mercedes will 
cost a fortune if it wasn't cared for."
car_4228,Look Younger & Thinner,"I bought the SLK350 just over a year ago. It's lived up to almost every expectation. Driving it is like handling a rocket. It has serious power and when you punch it, there is literally no hesitation. Even with the top down, there is no wind noise - you can listen to the radio and your hair doesn't look like you fixed it with a weed-eater. I do have the AirScarf and it makes a huge difference. Like everyone else I think the cupholder is an abomination. I knocked a full cup of coffee over in it (it's in a bad place AND it's flimsy). Now the buttons on my radio and heat/air are spongy and unpredictable. Mercedes can't fix them either. Still, a great car."
car_4229,SLK 230 review,"Neat car and fun to drive except could 
use a larger engine.  Comfortable 
around town but trips of several hours 
or more become tedious.  Retractable 
hard top only way to go."
car_4230,Its what you expect from Mercedes,"This is the second SLK I've owned and they get better each time. Fuel economy is 6.5L/110km that's 35 miles/g. The conv roof is slick, performance is wonderful. I'd highly recommend the worlds first 7 speed tranny."
car_4231,Just drive it!,Awesome car to drive with the top down of course.  To me it feels a lot better than the BMW's Z3s and feels a lot more solid.
car_4232,Never again,Cute car for wife. Build quality not what I expected for a Mercedes-Benz. Expensive to maintain. Took in for 12000 mile check up and left with a $351.77 bill with new wipers. The doors sound tinny when closing. The defoster only runs on high and is noisy.
car_4233,Fun Drive,"This car is a lot of fun to drive...in just about any weather.  You get all the advantadges of a convertible with much less hassle than comparable models.

Still, the car can ride a little rough now and then, and the road noise is not insignificant."
car_4234,Disappointed,"So yes the vehicle is great to look at and fun to drive. If you enjoy people staring and asking you how you can afford this vehicle than I recommend you buying one. However, I feel the vehicle being Mercedes and all they would have done better with a few things. The cup holder is right above the radio and a/c vents? Very uncomfortable and inconvenent place to set your drinks, very little support. There is no adjustment for the defrost function, it just blows out full force. So you are forced to turn in on and off when in use. Just recently the coating around the radio station program dials (0-9) has been peeling off. It seems to be due to the sun? This car is a convertible!"
car_4235,"Cool MB,  SLK350","Purchased this SLK350 in Chicago and immediately drove home to Texas. A fun drive. Averaged 28 mpg over the 1500 miles. We have no complaints. The car is what it is, a fun, attractive two seater. We had enough trunk space for an overnight suitcase and space for wine, etc. At the end of the day averaging 400 miles each day, we still felt good. Lots of honks and thumbs up on the road and walkaround inspections by other drivers at rest stops. The HK sound system is great. the navigation system, once you figure it out, works like a charm. Coffee cup holders are a bit of an after thought, but they do work. We love the car and think it will be fun to own and drive. Fit and finish in and out-great"
car_4236,This is an awesome Mercedes,"Love it. I like this roadster. It has a presence and a sound that turns heads. I put 19"" lorinser wheels on mine and they look sick."
car_4237,76,"I love the car it is very comfortable and I enjoy driving it.   The top is amazing to see go up and down.  We will have to take it to the shop to see what the wine is in the engine, but I am hoping that it is nothing serious.   We do have a warranty on it so hopefully whatever it is it will not cost us anything   it only had 10 thousand miles on it when we purchased it his month   I do love it"
car_4238,2996 SLK 280,"This car has been very reliable and fun to drive.  It has good visibility, handles nicely, and has a smooth ride. I had a 350Z before - and that was a much bumpier ride.   I only have minor complaints - the front bumper is so low that it is easy to ding it on curbs when parking.  Also, the cup holder is in a stupid location - in front of the a/c vent and in your field of view.  The thing I like best is the retractable hard top - most people are surprised that the car is a convertible.  When the see the top retract - they are amazed."
car_4239,06 SLK 350,I love this car the performance is awesome. It doesn't hurt when you are constantly getting compliments
car_4240,Never again,"There are problems with the switch that allows the top to go up and down.  The glove box in the center is broken more than fixed.  The handling is poor at best.  Not what you would expect for the price, I am going back to PORSCHE."
car_4241,"One word, awesome!","This car is great!  I always enjoy driving this car since it is not my daily driver. Great looks, top up or down, great handling, it's got it all!"
car_4242,Mechanical Nightmare,"OK, the car looks sexy and when it isn't in the shop it can be fun to drive. Only 18 months old I'm already in the market for a new car. The car has been in the shop seven times already. It blows tremendous amounts of smoke when it's cold and shakes violently when starting up. It leaks water from the roof. There is a constant whining noise on the passenger side mirror (which I'm told is pretty typical), new tires needed after 15,000 miles. Paint job is spotted in places looks like they missed  spots.  Lost display lights while driving and ""remove key"" light stayed on for days. Be careful, very low front easily damaged. Unfortunately, it's not worth the money. Very disappointed with car."
car_4243,Road Trip,"We all know it is blistering fast, fun to drive, and a real head-turner. The SLK 55 is also a very civilized beast. I use mine as a daily commuter, and it is a joy to drive, even in heavy traffic.  The car is just as comfortable on longer trips. I've just returned from an 800-mile trip, and it was one of the most enjoyable drives I have ever experienced. I was also pleasantly surprised to find I averaged 26 mpg, driving at 75 mph! Mileage was the same with top up or down."
car_4244,"Fast, great looking, and safe!","I bought my 2006 SLK55 AMG a year ago. I adored this car and its unique look. The handling was great, and it was a little rocket! Well, last week a woman in a truck crashed into me head on!  She didn't see me and it happened so quickly that neither of us had time to brake. I estimate the combined speed to be about 75mph. Well, that little car saved my life. The entire engine compartment looked like an accordion, but due to the safety design, the engine dropped versus penetrating the cab. The car looked like a smashed tin can with an intact cab!  The seatbelt and airbags deployed, and I escaped with relatively minor injuries.  I am ordering my brand new SLK55 right now!"
car_4245,One of a Kind,"I purchased my SLK55 AMG in March 2006. As a woman, I can tell you that it is awesome and the prettiest car on the road. It is also one of the fewest of this model around which I like because I like to be different. The stares are unreal. I think it could be more comfortable in the seating arrangement and the cupholder more accessible, but nothing major. Fast car!"
car_4246,The SLK,"Having traded a Corvette, I had no idea how exciting it would be to drive the SLK. This car feels like an extension of myself. It's responsive and performs very well. The 350 is no Corvette V-8, but it satisfies. I was surprised to find that the SLK is slightly heavier than the Corvette. It is so solid. It also has a boat load more features than the Corvette. The interior quality is far superior. The Corvette definitely has an agressive, muscular body. But the SLK is most assuredly sexy. I would definitely recommend this vehicle."
car_4247,Best Roadster in the 50k Range,"Pro: Very stylish and elegant. I have the silver one with red interior. The SLK 350 feels very solid on the road. Mine has the 6M and it is fun and easy to drive. Cons: The navigation unit failed once, the dealer replaced it with a new one, it has been working fine since."
car_4248,Should have gotten it sooner!,"I have the 6 speed manual 350, and everytime I get in the car, I can't help but smile. This car is such a joy to drive. The AirScarf option bascially makes this car an all season convertible, not just for summer. People look at you funny when driving in the middle of winter with the down down, but with heated seats and warm air blowing on your neck from the headrest, it is extremely comfortable. Wind noise is minimal, you can have a pleasant conversation with the top down driving 70 mph on the freeway. The free car wash at the dealership is an awesome service, never having to wash my car ever again!"
car_4249,What's best for $60-70k,"I drove them all, and  this was the best as it has all the creature comforts, can be driven in any format ie commute, aggressive back roads, flying on the highway, all the way to flat out racing,  -- equally well. Watching the jaws drop as you fly by is alone worth every cent. For the first time I got everything I ever wanted in a sports car with no sacrifices in safety or comfort. Drop the top, crank the sat radio, classic vinyl born to be wild and feel the smile spread from ear to ear, sing your lungs out and have more fun and performance than you ever ever thought possible.The one gripe I have exists in all exotics and that is annoying small problems that require a short dealer fix."
car_4250,SLK350 Review,"The car is great, engine is smooth and plenty of power. The extra cash for the 3.5L vs. the 3.0L is well worth it if you understand performance. The sound from the dual exhausts make you feel you are driving a car that normally costs twice as much! Yes, it is a little car, but once you're behind the wheel, you will feel like you are in control of a monster on wheels!  I recommend this vehicle for anyone that is looking for fun but also enjoys getting the looks from jealous drivers in their tame sedans as you pass them by. Get one, you won't regret it!"
car_4251,Love it,"I love to drive this car.  Especially with the top down. However, my husband leaves before I do in the morning so I usually have to drive our other car. This car is a lot of fun to drive. The hardtop convertible is great and very convenient to use. I love the heated seats and neck warmer. The ride can be a little jittery on some roads."
car_4252,A Great Little Car,"I had a Lambo door kit installed early on. For those not really in the know, people asked me if it was an SLR. I like the styling cues taken from the SLR. Several times other lesser car drivers have taken me on from a stoplite to their disappointment (just a quick launch).The exhaust note is wonderful, much better than my SLK32 AMG (which was a little faster). You just can't beat the sound of a V-8. The car receives compliments from both men and women alike. Handling through the canyons of So. Cal. is suberb."
car_4253,Dream come true,"I am so pleased with my new SLK 280.  It is such a pleasure to drive especially in the ""Sport"" mode. It hugs the road and the stability and handling are second to none.  The envious looks we get on the road are worth its weight in gold.  A real ""fun car"" and enjoyable driving experience."
car_4254,Don't get it.,"Don't get it if you don't like attention. This car is a looker and you'll get random people approaching you giving you compliments. Unlike others, I like the sound of the stock sound system. What's ridiculous though is that in 2006, it still won't play MP3s. The air-scarf is a must-have option. Get it, or regret it!"
car_4255,Love the Look,"I have had the car for over a year now. I love the look. Rides a little rough though. The top rattles when up, dealership told me that that happens with convertibles. I like the gas mileage, and the trunk is surprisingly accomodating. Standard audio system could be better. My only real complaint would be the noises and creaks that the top makes when up. Like everyone else, the cup holder is in a funky place."
car_4256,SLK 55 AMG,"Overall just an awsome car.  Fun to drive anywhere except terrible roads or off road where you would not want to be anyway.  Be careful of steep driveways as it is very low. Especially fun on the track.  On the track you can really push it and use the power and stability the car has for a great experience.  On the freeway I get about 24 mpg and on the track I get about 7.1 mpg.  I wish they had the performance option available when I ordered mine in mid 2005.  As long as it is not raining, the top is down and you never get cold with the heated seats, heater, and airscarf.  I have driven it in sunny 38 degrees top down and just a heavy shirt or light jacket.  You will love it."
car_4257,Worth every Penny!,"I have owned my SLK55 for a little less then a year.  I traded in my 2001 Porsche 911 Turbo for this AMG beast.  It handles like it is on rails, and accelerates with flawless shifting without ever missing a beat.  Easier to maintain than any other super car out there!  If you can get yourself into one, you won't regret it."
car_4258,Just simply amazing,"OK, it's expensive and it's not a super light little racer. But it's pretty much a fantastic performer in every area. Race track fun, Top down crusing, luxury tour driving, and looks to simply kill. Pulling up to the finest manor house is not a problem. It's not perfect at anything, Just perfect at everything."
car_4259,Definite winner,"This is the first sporty car I've had since my 1973 911T.  Needless to say, that car set a high standard. The SLK exceeded my expectations. Not a ""chick car"", the MB handles and performs like a real sports car.  Plus, it's comfortable for a tall driver (6'5"").  Don't know yet about the reliability, but I'm hoping the R171 platform has it designed in. Daimler really got it right with this one!"
car_4260,"Great Fun, Little Car","This car is built for those of us who have our transportation needs covered by our other vehicles. The car is fun and fast, with a depandable and quick response to what the driver wants it to do. The 3.5 liter engine can get you into ""illegal territory"" in absolutely no time. My wife and I love our SLK 350 and will recommend it to any one who wants to spoil themselves with some luxury fun. Get used to compliments, because people will walk up to you with some nice words about that car."
car_4261,SLK-Size doesn't matter,"The new SLK-series body turns heads no matter where you go.  The lines on the car for the price are the best that I have seen from any other car manufacturer.  As for the motor, the 350 delivers a sufficient 268 hp which might seem small at first, however once in the cockpit of this rocket, you will be shot forward once the gas pedal is pressed.  Many view this car as a ""woman"" car, however whoever declares this will probably not be bale to keep up with you.  I am very pleased with my SLK350 and would advise anyone who is considering a mildly priced sports car to give it a test drive.  Being in the market for a sports car, I considered the Z4, and G35, however the SLK was a no-brainer."
car_4262,Great Car/Head Turner,"Great value for a Mercedes roadster. Better than the cheaper version ""Saturn"". I'm happy with my purchase. Hardtop convertible is awesome."
car_4263,SLK350,"No longer a ""chick car"", the SLK 350 is now a worthy competitor in the sports car arena.  It is a decent blend of sports car purism, a la Honda S2000, and grand tourer, a la its older sibling, the SL500.  Great to look at, fun to drive - a real head-turner."
car_4264,Fine for a Chrysler not good for a MB,"I've been driving my 280 for 4 months, 5K miles.  It's a pretty good car but the overall perceived quality is lower than I expect on a Mercedes.  I had a couple of rattles, in fact I still do, but the dealer has been patient enough to check it. Still not up to what I'd expect, especially as a prior BMW owner. The drive is fun and the 3.0 engine is more than enough.  I do find that it takes a little time to respond to a ""full gas"".  The trunk is deceivingly spacious, enough for a couple of beach chairs, umbrellas an a picnic bag. But it lacks some in cabin storage, especially if you opted for the 5-disc changer that takes up your glove compartment's miniscule space."
car_4265,I want to live in it.,"It is the prettiest and the most satisfying car I've ever driven. Exhilirating straight away, in curves, uphill, downhill and just sitting still."
car_4266,Awesome Red Screamer,"After putting 3k miles on my new SLK280 I must say Im enjoying it more and more each time I drive. Only drawback is the seats. No lumbar support and the big drawback, very non ambient stereo. Wish it would have come with at least a basic base system. No way to upgrade according to Mercedes. Otherwise, fun car and sharp looking."
car_4267,Best Convertible,"At 3k miles, only minor driverside window prob.  Interior easily marks up / difficult to clean.  Great car -- I believe that's why I bought one. Guys drool at it and women admire it.  Sporty, classy and fun."
car_4268,The AMG Difference,"It's everything I have dreamed it would be. Very smooth power delivery but responsive if need be. Very stable at high speed with very minimal body lean on corners. Rigid body structure but comfortable suspension, without compromising stability. Superb handling characteristic. Fade free braking experience. Awesome looks"
car_4269,Wow...what a fun toy!,"Finally I've got a toy that I always wanted. A fun to drive, powerful car that is a convertible as well. After riding in the Cayenne and the A6, the SLK is so much fun. Yes, the ride is stiff, yes, it is a gas guzzler, but the feeling you get when you step on gas and the way the car responds can't be beat! I tired the new Cayman S, but the SLK55 won me over with its looks and performance. The Capris Blue with light beige Nappa leather is amazing. The Command and the satellite with the upgraded sound system is excellent. I thought that the trunk space would be limited, but is big enough to pack for 2 people for a weekend."
car_4270,Honey I am going to the Store Again!,"This is the best car I have owned!  I had a certain level of expectation that the car would be really good but the SLK 350 far exceed my expectations!  I am 6'4"" and fit in the car just fine.  The car has very responsive sports car ride.  The interior is just as impressive as the exterior.  Instrumentation and electronics are spectacular!  The extras are well worth the money, preset power seats between my wife and I, key controlled remote for the top outside the car, cruse control sets to the exact speed.   The neck scarf is a must.  The gas mileage is much better than I expected!  The car is very quiet with the top up and very little wind noise with the top down! Clearly the best!"
car_4271,Sweet!,"This is my first Mercedes and I love it.  I look forward to going to work so I can drive it.  Great power and handling.  Turns on a dime, and stops in no time.   Need to be careful, even with the top down it is easy to get over the speed limit without even noticing.  Love the retractable top.  Great sound system with the upgrade and neck scarf is nice.  Gets surprisingly good gas mileage, I get 25+ mpg on my drive to work as long as the top is up and 22- 23 with the top down."
car_4272,SLK350 is Great!,I bought this car as a toy for driving this spring and summer.  So far it has been nothing short of wonderful.
car_4273,Great Car,"Love the car, great performance, fun to drive. Recommend spending extra to get the entertainment package really worth the $'s. Also recommend the ipod kit. Nice to have all that music available in such a great car. This car will perform when pushed and the sound from the engine is thrilling.  Con-watch out for speed bumps and curb stoppers. the front cowl is low and it is easy to bump without knowing."
car_4274,Awesome!,"If you're shy don't get this -- it's definitely an attention getter. It's an awesome car. The ride is stiff and depending on your road conditions, you will feel it. No problems at all on the highway though -- nice and smooth. I also find the middle and back compartments a bit hard to get at. It is low to the ground so can be hard to get out of for some. Not thrilled with COMAND controls -- my other car (BMW 528) is much more intuitive and I agree with Arisdad that the panel is better on the BMW. Understeer is more pronounced than I expected. These are of course all very minor complaints. The car is exactly what you expect but a lot more fun."
car_4275,I love my SLK!,"I just got my SLK and LOVE it!  Its exterior is so sharp, and the car is so fun to drive.  (I'm one of those crazy ""have to have a manual"" for fun factor!) I look forward to warm weather and being able to drive with the top down.  The car is quiet.  I love having the navigation system and the stereo upgrade.  I don't know about the reliability as the car is so new. Vroom!"
car_4276,So you want fast...,"I can't tell you all the fun I've had so far. The SLK 350 is so fast with 7 speed auto trans. We all know the 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 sec but how about this 60 to 90 in 3.2 sec!! Wow, this car is a dream for under $50k"
car_4277,Almost perfect,"Besides not being able to find exactly what options I wanted in the color I wanted I absolutely love this car, I just didn't feel like waiting 3-4 months. I really wanted to at least test drive a 6 speed manual but no dealers in my area had one in stock or even on order, strange huh. But I have to admit the 7 speed auto is pretty responsive, especially in sport/ summer mode. I wasn't looking to get the Airscarf but now I wouldn't have one without it. We recently took a 2 day trip and came over the Sierra's at night with the top down, temps in the 20's and we were quite cozy. It was AWESOME being able to see the stars."
car_4278,A fun car to own,"We got the car delivered in October and there was still some season left to enjoy the ""topless"" ride. The air scarf makes this convertibe fun to drive even by temperatures are in the 50'es. We use the car only as a fun toy when the weather is right. A hardtop/convertible is the way to go. The trunk space is limited and makes shopping sprees more afordable."
car_4279,Frank V.,"The 2006 SLK has great styling, and the good looks of it's bigger brother, the SL series. I enjoy its ""Bat Man"" face,  ease of convertible top operation, and other ""systems"" as well.  It is a good value and a fun machine to drive on a daily basis, assuming you have another vehicle to do the ""work"" when need be, such as our ML series SUV.  Frank Vranicar"
car_4280,SLK3550,"Vehicle is  a great handling car. Layout internally is outstanding. The response of the top is very good. The gas mileage is better than I expected, but is not real good. GPS was hard to understand at first but after using it a few times it has been great. Styling outside is terific, gret lines. Very happy with this automobile."
car_4281,Fantastic fun top up or down,I ordered my car to obtain the options I wanted especially a manual trans.  I also got the AMG kit and sports suspension.  The car is a true sports car in this configuration and handles exceedingly well.  The interior is thoughtfully laid out and well appointed.  The manual is new for the redesigned SLK and has solid and short throws.  Ultimately though the car was purchased for its fantastic hardtop convertible feature.  With the top up it is very quiet but 22 seconds later you are enjoying a great convertible.  If you keep the windows raised and use the wind blocker you can drive comfortably down into the 40 degree range.  I did get the airscarf and it in NOT a gimmick.  It is a must have.
car_4282,Got to have it,"WOW!! I have looked and driven many different cars, but this tops the charts.  It's styling, performance, and the hard top says it all.  I had several cars that I was comparing for this purchase, but the SLK350 had everything.  Spend the little extra to get the heated seat package, well spent money when top is down in the cool weather.  Very quite with top on, but unbelieveably quite when top is off.  Seats I was worried from past reviewers would not be comfortable, but have to say they are built the way they should be and with the heat on I feel pampered, even having back troubles.  I say go for it, you won't be disappointed; and if anything you'll find excuses for going out for a drive."
car_4283,My First AMG,"I bought this car after a couple of test drives and I have no regrets. It accelerates like a 60's muscle car and handles beautifully. It was a great replacement for my TT roadster.  While other manufacturers may offer fancier instrument panels (my wife's BMW 530i for instance), I love the simplicity of the MB cabin."
car_4284,SLK280,"This car is really fun to drive.  It handles well in the curves without being too harsh, and the 7 speed auto works well with the 2.8 litre engine.  Good blend of power and mileage - about 24 mpg in town and 30 on the freeway.  It has more head room than the Lexus SC 430 and the trunk fits our largest suitcase, even with the top down - not bad for a little car.  Air scarf and heated seats work great. Standard radio is fair, and the stock Michelin Pilot Primacy tires are noisy.  Everythng works perfect. I love the exterior appearance, top up or down, and the gray interior looks sharp. This car makes going to work, running errands, and seeking out scenic, windy roads a lot of fun."
car_4285,Great Car!!,"This is truly a great car to drive everyday! It's fast, comfortable, reliable and just overall amazing.  With the top up or down there is no better ride out their for the money!"
car_4286,My new SLK280,"Everything is perfect about the car except the stupid cupholder design!  One tiny bump in the road and your drink drips  down the center control panel.  Also I should have waited for the model with the heat scarf and better stereo system.  After market Mercedes did not wire the glove box to add a changer, and the base stereo package does not come with rear speakers, just dummy speaker covers which makes the sound thin.  Drives great.....love it otherwise"
car_4287,My Mercedes Rocketship,"I love to drive this vehicle, particularly with the top down. I have a 7 speed automatic. I love the retractable hardtop and the air scarf system. I do not find the blind spots often mentioned in reviews, because the pillarless large side windows give outstanding vision. Fuel economy has been better than I expected. The only problem I have, is that the sport seats are a little hard, and can get a little uncomfortable on an extemely long trip (5 hours or more). Overall, driving this car is an exhilarating experience."
car_4288,The New Mercedes SLK Class,"After testing many convertibles, it was easy to go back to the Mercedes dealership (check in hand) and make my purchase.  The fun-to-drive feature can't be beat, but the combined with safety and overall performance make the SLK-Class truly a ""best in class"" vehicle.  And of course, the little Mercedes insignia on my keychain is pretty cool too.  Let's face it, when you're buying a luxury converible, it's kinda cool to know you're driving a Benz!"
car_4289,2006 SLK280,"I recently traded in my BMW 328is for the Mercedes slk280.  I looked into the BMW z4, Porsche boxster, and the Mercedes CLK in addition to the SLK.  Besides some very minor interior design detail flaws the car is a perfect match.  The dealership was a major factor in purchasing.  Since BMW left me with a sour taste due to their poor customer service in the repair department.  I chose the Mercedes which ranked in my opinion neck and neck with the z4.  Mercedes service and responsiveness was out of this world.  The entire transaction was effortless and w/o a doubt a fine deal all around.  Absolutely no regret. SLK280 w/stand. Trans was more than powerful.  The automatic version wasn't as fun."
car_4290,It's worth the price,My wife had a SLK 320 and I never liked it; I am very small but feel cramped in it. I don't feel that way with the SLK 350. It no longer looks like a chic car. Handling is much better and it does feel sporty. All the creak and groan are gone with the top up. Top folding and raising are much faster than the SLK 320. The freeway milage is surprising (27.4). Some people may like more storing space but I think the CD changer in the glove box is more convenient. The flip top features of the arm rest is also convenient. The automatic partial rolling down of the windows may help to prevent the leaking of the door weather strips (as in the SLK 320).
car_4291,Pure Power,"I pressed the pedel, and power came calling. I moved the steering wheel, and moved around a dime. Everyone has a positive opinion of how great my car looks. The cockpit fits like a custom fit glove! Now the first payment is due, ah well who is better then ME! (My wife) It's worth it.  Pure!"
car_4292,"""crisis car""","Given my age at 65... I'm a good ways past a mid-life crisis! I decided to get a convertible ""crisis car"". Like MB says...life is too short and the road  too long not to drive a Benz. I have owned and driven four Nissan Z cars in the most recent years. The SLK, in my opinion, is by far the better car! I think the car gives you beyond what you might expect from a roadster in this price range. Others agree that with a mere flick of a switch you're in a convertible or hardtop...it doesn't get any better!! In my opinion this car gives you all the power and all the performance that you would need in todays traffic conditions. The gas mileage is a definite advantage given todays current prices!!"
car_4293,Perfect-10,"Purchased the 030 package; well worth the price.  The braking and improved handling over the standard 55 can be measured by the seat-of-your-pants dyno.  Zero to WOW in about 15 seconds.  The ""Nuerburgring"" suspension allows this vehicle to corner with anything- bar none."
car_4294,Perfect car-SLK55,18-19MPG in town.  0-WOW in seconds.  Optional 030 package is worth every penny.  Braking is unreal.
car_4295,Cute but dangerous. Be Careful.,"This is my third Benz in as many years.  Had the SLK 320, SL 500, now SLK 350.  Unfortunately, I already rear ended a Lincoln Towncar in LA.  The anitlock brakes locked and I slid 300 feet going 45 mph.  Mercedez denies this but the skid marks proved the brakes locked.  Did zero damage to the Lincoln but $10K damage, 6 weeks in shop, to my SLK.  The front is entirely plastic save the hood, but that plastic is incredibly pricey.  No engine damage.  Later going 10 miles per hour and slammed brakes and skidded.  This car does not want to stop, too light.  Be careful - stay back.  Tried to upgrade to Nav system, 6 disk CD, and iPod integration.   ALL are factory, no upgrades."
car_4296,SLK350,I love the car it handles great. It has a lot of power & great pick up speed which makes it great for getting in & out of traffic.    It also turns on a dime. For a 2 seater it is very comfortable. I love the car!
car_4297,Unreliable,"Two weeks after purchasing the car check engine light came on. Dealer could not find any thing wrong when took the car in. Engine check light comes on and off (Not because the gas cap is not tight). Dealer says nothing to worry about. A few days later ESP light came on. After that had problem to turn the car on. Tried to trade in the car that purchased for $60K with less than 800 miles, they offered only $41K."
car_4298,I love this car,"This is the only car I've ever had that makes me laugh when I drive it cause it's just so much fun to drive...and it's so very beautiful.  I don't even mind sitting in Los Angeles traffic -- well, except when I'm stuck behind some truck blowing smoke in my face when the top is down.   My car is black on black, and I call it ""Black Beauty."" I especially enjoy the neck warmer so that I can take advantage of the hard-top convertible even when it gets cooler at night.  If you don't want attention, this car isn't for you cause people sure do notice it. :-)"
car_4299,I love this car!,"I haven't had a car that made me laugh when I drive it since my Triumph in high school.  It is beautiful, handles like a dream and is a blast to drive on the open road or in Los Angeles traffic."
car_4300,Excellent Automobile!,"The Mercedes-Benz SLK 55 AMG is probably one of the fastest affordable roadsters around. With its Formula One inspired design, this car gets looks by all sorts of people. On the mechanical side, the Formula One inspired gear box helps deliver the V8's 355 HP to the wheels giving the driver a neck snapping take off. The steering response is the quickest I've ever seen in any automobile. The braking is superb. It can slow you down from 95 m.p.h. so fast that your organs fall out of place ( Attempted in a controlled enviroment). As for the interior, its very roomy. The nice bucket seats will keep you firmly planted. Finally, the paddles a nicely postioned behing the steering wheel. AMG Rocks!"
car_4301,Dont bother,"Although a great car to look at, you will generally have a Kia Sorento Loan Vehicle as it spends so long in the shop. Engine & transmission problems, roof locking down, ESP malfunctions & generally everything you can think of. Great styling & fun when it goes but way too unreliable for the $50K price tag. Wait for the X2 model before trying!"
car_4302,"Finally, a great looking SLK","I just got a new SLK280 a few days ago. So far it has been near perfect. I was concerned about MB quality based on what I've read but so far so good.  The car has great performance, styling, comfort and even good gas mileage. I'm fairly short and the Comfort Package with the 8 way power seats allowed for a wide range of adjustment.  I restored and drove vintage British sportscars for 15 years.  This car is as much fun to drive and seems to be very high quality. Styling is great.  I'll write another review in six months or so and let you know if there have been any problems.  By the way, I got the 280 instead of the 350 because it has plenty of power, better gas mileage and a $4K lower price."
car_4303,Great Looking Car With Performance,Great looking car that turns heads.  Lots of great comments about the design of the car.  I had a 350Z before this car and always wanted a convertible but didn't want a rag top and didn't like the design of the older SLK's.  The new SLK350 was the answer with design and the retractable top.  Great handling on mountain roads and on the freeways.
car_4304,Perfect Commuter,"I spend over an hour each way commuting five times a week. My SLK350 is perfectly suited to handle bumper to bumper, open highway, and pleasure cruising. Top down, windows up it's nearly as quiet as top up.  This car also saved me from a near collision with two deer late one night with strong night vision and panic-sure maneuverability at 65+ mph.  The cockpit layout is very ergonomic and the controls easy to use without taking eyes from the road.  I have liked many previous cars, but the SLK350 is my first-time love affair."
car_4305,You deserve it! (Buy it - don't lease it),Great car!  Fun to drive.  Convertible is open in less than 25 seconds.  Heat scarf in head-rest lets you keep warm with the top down when the air is cool.  Don't lease it - do the math and buy it!
car_4306,Its a rocketship,The last car that I had this much fun driving was a 1972 240z.  I traded a 2002 SL500 in for this car.  It drives like a sports car and sounds even better
car_4307,Fun in the sun,I have had my car for a few months now and still get excited to drive it.  It has more than enough power to imprint you into the seat and hugs curves like a glove.  It performs like an exotic sports car without the six figure price tag.  I can say that I have never been a Mercedes fan but have been won over with this car.
car_4308,Very Happy,"After many Acura NSX leases, I came back to the SLK 350 of '06. It's less expensive, but more comfortable, and I've already had comments from strangers. The diamond silver (baby blue) with ash interior is a knockout. Spend extra on the remote roof control and wood trim interior. The automatic transmission is very smooth. Remember to tell your dealer to skip their advertising on the car. It looks better without it."
car_4309,Fun Ride,"A really fun car.  Great handling with a smooth, powerful engine. There seem to be some rattles coming from behind the seats that others have complained about too."
car_4310,Room for a big guy,"I am 6 feet 6 inches, and this is the car that I found that not only I could sit in with comfort, but have a ball driving. This car is blessed with good power, very good handling, and an eye catching look. It comes with a nice standard package, but a few of the upgrades can make it special. I looked at the Boxter, and Vette, but couldn't sit in either with any comfort. Last but not least, the power hardtop on the Benz is awsome."
car_4311,bahama blue beautiful,A beautiful car!!!
car_4312,Terrible investment,"This car sucks...I would NEVER get another MB...My convertible roof doesn't work, the dashboard is falling apart, I lost the driver's side mirror, the windshield is cracked.  It's a 1999 with 98K miles on it...I'm looking to get rid of it and get something more reliable, especially since I was told by MB that it would cost approx. $2K to replace my driver's mirror."
car_4313,My SLK was a frustrating piece of engineering!,"No doubt that Chrysler had an influence on the design of this car.   The parts inside the car were very cheaply made and looses its shine and color.  The car is a lot of work to maintain its look and ride.  I would try to get the SL class or the CLK first before buying the SLK.  It's really more of a barbie doll car, definitely not a man's vehicle."
car_4314,SLK230 Longterm Owner,"I bought my '99 SLK230 new.It is the base model and my favorite commuting car.I now have over 110K on it and it has been a very good car.I have had what seems to be pattern failures on the vehicle.MAF sensor right around 70K miles, K40 Relay failed at 78K and I found and re-soldered the melted connection and it has been good ever since.  one could simply buy a new one, for under $100 and replace it quite easily. I did encounter a noisy camshaft variable timing unit which was the most expensive part I've replaced, part cost was close to $400. and I'm a Euro car tech so fixed it myself. The electrical connector on the transmissions leak fluid about every 5 year/50K miles.I've replaced one plastic shift bushing and think the second one is now due, the parts cost is about $1.00.   They are a little tricky to replace but can be done even without a special tool with a little patience, but the special tool is great.Even though I have other MB's to drive, such as a CLK cabriolet, if I am running errands and such this is my ""go to"" car.  It is just fun to drive.   They are a bit noisy or more so than most MB's so I think they got a bad rap early on, as I recall many being for sale shortly after being purchased with very low miles many years ago.   One thing that contributes to higher noise levels in this vehicle is when the rear tires get some miles on them.   One might think there is a problem with the rear differential, the noise is so pronounced.  With the staggered tire sizes on this vehicle, rotating front to back is not an option, so the tires do acquire some pattern wear.   This is exacerbated if one purchases cheaper tires with a large block tread, so beware.As far as mileage goes, in normal commuting, I conservatively get 24.5  mpg and have achieved 28 mpg on long highway trips with the A/C off and 70-80mph cruising speeds.   Short drives of 2-3 miles with lots of starts might drop the mileage down to 22.5 or so, but this is rather unusual.   The color of my car is white and it still looks fantastic after all these years.   I have used the factory touch-up paint to fill in some paint chips and the car polishes out very nicely.   Recently, we drive the vehicle down to vote and was stopped by some admirers who thought the car was new.   Clearly not an MB person, but reflects positively on the condition and the enduring style of this original SLK."
car_4315,Fun and reliable Mercedes roadster,"My car is a '99 SLK230 Komp with sport pack, in auto. The build quality is mechanically solid, though interior is minimal with some cheap bits (expect rattles, paint flaking). An all weather daily driver, put about 20k miles on it in 2.5 years, and nothings failed yet (at 90k miles). The drive is sporty and stiff, with moderate accel (185hp/ 200ft lbs). Road volume's loud, but so is the Bose stereo. Interior accomodations are perfect for smaller people, as the wheel base is pretty short, but big people will feel cramped.In general, a great little convertible with classy style that is fun at safe speeds and has a driving experience I enjoy. It's just better than its competition..."
car_4316,"Fun car, troublesome power top. 5 speed manual.","Cool car, but the top can be very troublesome (and expensive to fix).If you are considering buying, make sure top is in good working order.Fun to drive, but 4 cylinder is a little weak and doesn't sound great.Bose stereo is terrific.Ride is harsh, but to be expected.No mechanical problems in the 10k miles I've had the car (90k-100k),seems reliable.Also, be careful you don't close the top on something rigid - you will shatter the rear window glass.Ask me how I know."
car_4317,"Small, Simple and Fun!","This car is great. After I bought this car, I looked at many reviews on the SLK and it got a lot of scorn and bad reviews about bad handling and mediocre performance ect. But the SLK230 is honestly a fantastic car to own. I have the one with the sport AMG package which adds the AMG body kit and wheels, but not a suspension upgrade as I assumed until I looked it up. This car is built solidly, when Mercedes was good and not overly complicated with computers, and for that reason I believe its so reliable. The reliability for me could rival a Toyota, no problems at all. The handling is excellent. It stays flat in the corners and is extremely nimble with good steering feel."
car_4318,too much fun!,"I bought my SLK in 2006 with 110,000 miles on it. I've owned six Benzes, all used when I bought them. The SLK is the most expensive to maintain and worth every penny. One reason I bought this car is the manual transmission, something SLs haven't had in the US since 1972. It's way too easy to get a speeding ticket with this car. I actually prefer a soft top with seasonal hard top (as on my 190 SL and 230 SL) The retracting top is OK too but needs maintenance."
car_4319,1999 SLK230,"I bought my 1999 SLK used in September 2008 with only 25,000 miles on the odometer, which is very low miles for a 9 year old car.  This model has a timeless style that still looks new....everyone who see's it cannot believe its not just a couple years old instead of 9. It's definitely an attention getter, mine is black on black. I now have 38,000 miles on it and all I've had maintenance wise is oil changes and tires.  At 52, I plan on this being the last car I own, I'd never get rid of it!"
car_4320,Great Car,"I bought this car for my 80 year old mother in 1999.She had a lot of nice cars over the years. I took my driving test in her 190 SL in 1955. This SLK was her last car, she passed away in 2007. Presently it only has 16800 miles on it. Silver body, red and black 2 tone seats. It is a bit uncomfortable, not much seat padding. The supercharger provides quick pick up. It did have a top problem early on,that was fixed in a recall. It also had an interior paint problem. Some of the dash and side panels are red painted plastic. The red paint started to flake. I understand the Mercedes did fix some of them early on. I had it repainted. The base color on all SLK's interior plastic was black."
car_4321,Fun Car,"I bought this car for my Mom in November of 1988. She was 82 years old at the time, and while she loved the car, she was mad we did not get the stick shift! She always liked the SL's.  I took my driving test in a 190 SL back in the 50's. It was a stick shift. When I visited her in Fla,she would take me out in her 230 SLK. The original tires gave out in 10,000 miles. It also had the roof problem, but that was fixed under warranty. Her car is silver with a red and black interior. They apperently used some type of red paint on the interior parts, and that started to chip, Mercedes did repair some on a selective basis. Mom passed away in 2007. She drove until age 90. Car is in CT now with 15,500 miles on it"
car_4322,So much fun!,"I am loving every minute of it. The sport package is a must, as it ""beefens"" the look of the SLK. I am used to V-8, but the turbo picks up quick! Make sure to get an extended warranty, if possible, as MB is known for its mechanical problems. Had a defective camshaft position sensor within the first 2 weeks of ownership, but warranty covered it. Has been known to have recurring problems with the PSE pump (locks the doors and sets the alarm). Check out online forums to get a feel for potential problems of the SLK.  Overall, this vehicle is sexy! You will love every minute of driving. I get stares everywhere I go, with the top up, down, and in between. Friends call it the bat-mobile."
car_4323,1999 Merecedes SLK230 Kompressor,"I puechased my pre-owned 1999 SLK230 in 2008, for $9995. It had 115,000 miles on the odometer. The near flawless exterior burgundy paint finish, and the excellent unretouched condition of the interior hinted that this car had not been abused. The SLK230 looks best when viewed from a 3/4 view at the rear. It  is definitely sexy, and draws a lot of attention when being driven. This car is best put through its sportscar paces when driven by an experienced driver who knows how to shift the 4-speed automatic tranny manually. Downshift to 3rd  when entering a curve, and then floor it at the apex of the curve. It will rocket out of the curve as if on rails. And still give 25-30MPG. Wow"
car_4324,Too much fun!,"This car handles superbly, accelerates quickly for a 4-cylinder, and is comfortable and fairly quiet with the top on at high speeds (watch that!).  It takes about a minute to trade the quiet and safety of a hard top for the thrill of a convertible.  Everyone except my wife loves this car (maybe it's those speeding tickets)."
car_4325,Best of the Best,"This is the very best car I have every owned and driven!  The only flaw that needs to be mentioned is the interior ""rubber/vinyl"" paint finish, applied to components, peels off after long exposure with human body parts resting on it. Example the outside of your knee where it touches middle console and where your arm rests(due to body temp. & moisture). It will also chip-off, if your not careful, when fastening the seat belt as it can stike middle console as well(Mercedes-Benz please fix).  Cheers!"
car_4326,Cr2006,"It has been an extreme fun and reliable experience. Never want to get rid of it. The only ""but""? If you gain weight, you can't fit! Perfect car for two. Not good for drives longer then 6 hours.  Beautiful interior and exterior. Never looks old!"
car_4327,'99 Mercedes SLK 230 Roadster,"I bought this 4-year old used roadster for $22,000 out the door.  This has been the funnest cars I've ever owned.  I've had some minor problems but nothing too pricey.  Brakes lasted only 15,000 miles which I thought was a bit soon, but since it's a safety feature no sense fighting.  No other major issues to report.  Biggest issue is the lack of trunk space.  If it's a choice between my golf clubs and my wife, my clubs are in the passenger seat.  She can drive herself.  :)  Overall, a fun, well-built car."
car_4328,A Blast to Drive!,"This car is so much fun to drive! On a beautiful spring/summer/fall day, fold the hard top into the trunk and cruise around in this sporty turbocharged convertible."
car_4329,I luv my bumble bee!,"I bought this car about 3 months ago with 70,000 miles on it, and it has been nothing but a complete joy to drive for me.  I am one of the few that took the plunge and bought the yellow, and this car stands out in the crowd and definitely draws a compliment everywhere I go.  It is fun to dirve, but definitely has the Mercedes feeling to it, sexy with a lot of luxury and style!"
car_4330,One drive won me over,"I have never owned a Mercedes before (Toyota, Honda and Acura) and was frankly a little skeptical that the three pointed start was really worth the premium.  At any rate, while on the lot looking at another vehicle we saw the SLK and decided to take it for a spin, just for a lark.  Wow!  A warm summer afternoon -  a twisty road by the water's edge - brilliant blue skies - let's just say we never really had a chance!  It was love at first drive.  2 months later we are still blissing out each time we take it for a drive."
car_4331,Watch The Roof On This Car,"I have had this car for approximately 2months now, and I'm a bit disappointed. I have to say this car doesn't get as many looks as the Z3 that my sister owns. I thought the roof was one of the great things about this car until I started having trouble with it about a week after I bought it and the dealer doesn't want to fix it. It's going to cost me $850 just to get the roof working, and $350 to fix a balljoint. For as expensive as it was when it was new, I don't think it should have these problems already with only 60,000 miles on it. But I have to say I do like driving it when it's not in the shop. I just have to be careful, when the sun goes down the top doesn't come up out of the trunk."
car_4332,Too much fun!,"i purchased this car very used with 103,700 mileson it,  but very very clean.  Had a problem with the micro switches in the roof but the dealer fixed it, and it works great now.  This thing moves. I can go from zero to ticket way too fast.  A tad stiff for the old bones, but heck it's a sports car. Even scooting in the mountains and freeways, I got 28mpg over a 500 mi. drive.  I love it."
car_4333,Fun and classy,"I purchased the car last summer with 29,000 miles on it.  No regrets.  It is fun to drive, and I constantly get compliments.  Only problem was some bad microswitches for the roof (a known problem for 1999).  Once they were replaced, the car has been flawless.  Acceleration is good, with a wide power band.  Just fun to drive with the top up, or especially down."
car_4334,Great Car,"This car is my first Benz and I have always wanted a convertible Benz.  Mine has over 80,000 miles on it now and the feeling I have is that I don't really need a new car.  This car has timeless styling, is very practical, gets great gas mileage and performs well.  I have heard you can drive these things for 150,000 miles if you want without a lot of problems.  This is a real Mercedes and it acts like one - not like a normal car that becomes obsolete at a certain point."
car_4335,Classy Car,"I just purchased this car a couple of weeks ago with 57k miles on it and I love the style, exterior (Glacier white) and two tone (black/oyster) interior.  I replaced the tires after about a week of owning it and it cut down on the road noise tremendously! This also has shocks not struts so they are easy to replace if you need to. Engine is so quiet you can't tell its running at a stop light. The convertible top is great! Like having two cars in one.  Trunk is huge...I'm a realtor and I have room to place my signs in the trunk among other things. This was a lease car previously and seems like it was very well maintained. I will update in a few months of ownership."
car_4336,Be cautious with this car,"I have had the car about 1.5years now and I have to say this car is a mixed bag.  While its fun to drive, comfy for long rides, enjoyable in general it looses a lot of luster because its plagued with so many problems.  Many cheap problems like peeling dash paint, rubbing c pillar, etc.  Do your research before you get this car or you may regret it dearly, as I have.  The car since I bought it used as averaged a breakdown or malfunction ever 1.5 months, not an okay record for a car this expensive.  My Starmark warranty is up and I will be getting rid of the car unfortunately."
car_4337,Love my Benz,"I purchased my 1999 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 with high miles, but being as though it was a seasonal car, and I had always wanted one I made the plunge and I am happy I did. From the first day I got it I had nothing but compliments weather it be from people I know to a complete stranger passing by on the nice warm days with the top down. But that's only the start.  this car has great styling and awesome fuel milage.  At 92,000 miles, nothing major has gone wrong.  The electrical compents went out before I got the car but the previous owner fixed it. It cost about $1,000 to fix.  Other than that Its an awesome car so far."

drop the Vario-roof while waiting at an

which is what you want in U.S. (seeing 
how we have 60~70MPH speed limits.)  
There is no performance difference

locking system works intermittently.  
MB is still good on service.  All of 
the above have been repaired (under 
warranty) and a nice new E-Class was 
provided while the repairs were done.  
However, I remember not so long ago 
when you bought a new MB you never had 
to deal with these type of problems."
car_4348,Sooo much fun you'll fall in love,"I never thought of owning an SLK until a friend had suggested test driving one.  Since then, I have been more than impressed with the performance and overall quality.  I did run into a manufacturer's defect with the side door panel.  The Mercedes dealer gave me a loaner and fixed it right up."
car_4349,Fun and Practical,"Of all the roadsters out there under $50k, this one is the easiest to live with every day without giving up the fun. The retractable hard-top means you have a coupe with the top up. The trunk is 9 cubic ft, better than any other roadster. Power is great from a dead stop, but it does hesistate a little when accelerating at speed. Reliability has been great."
car_4350,A true sleeper which gets much better mileage,"I am amazed at how inexpensive this car is on the used market. It is a true supercar at the price of a Miata! Incredible handling, killer looks, awesome straight line acceleration, stop on a dime brakes, and way better than advertised fuel economy. Loving every minute."
car_4351,What's not to like?,"I purchased the car because I was tired of looking for ""safe"" parking for my Porsche Boxster. The hard-top convertible gives me peace-of-mind so I can park on-street. For the first few weeks, I really missed the Porsche. But now I wouldn't go back.  After adjusting to the different ride characteristics, I feel it handles as well as the Boxster and is far superior for longer drives. The AMG sport package is a must if you want a sports car experience. I've owned MG's, Triumphs, 240Z, 260Z, Porsche 911 Carrerra, Porsche 944 and Porsche Boxster (yes, I'm now an old guy.) This car is as much fun as any of my past cars, and as fast as anything I've driven."
car_4352,Wife's car. My mid-life toy.,"My wife has the Edition model with a 7- speed automatic. Silver on black. This car looks cool and is a blast to drive. Off the line, it's not especially quick.  But once the RPM get above 2500, look out!  This car really moves. You can accelerate to 80 MPH (and much higher)in the blink of an eye. And it sounds like a sports car.  Terrific fun. The wife used to have a '03 SLK320.  The '08 280 is a much better car.  It has a much better ride and is much more fun to drive."
car_4353,Defect in Radio Mercedes Won't Fix,"My 2008 Slk Mercedes, purchased Sirius Radio service and I started losing stations. I notified Mercedes, they looked at my car 3 times, told me all 08 & 09 Mercedes where the sat. in sky is positioned, certain stations have weak signals. Called Sirius Radio, they said that is not true, antenna or cable in car. Then Mercedes told me since Sirius merged with Xm some of the 08 & 09  radios will not work, because there is a Bug in the radio preventing it from picking up some radio stations, because the radio was built before the merger. Called Sirius,they confirmed in writing, a merger takes 5 years, and Sirius sat. are running off sirius, xm off xm. Notified Mercedes of this, and they refused"
car_4354,My wife's Dream Car,We enjoy this special car because of its unique appearance and build quality.  The car is very stable on the highway and absorbs road imperfections well.  The black metallic paint is of superior quality and shines beautifully (if clean).  The gear shifter feels industrial in strength but the sun visors are very small and cheap.  Seats are firm but comfortable for long distance cruising.  Road noise can be heard from the rear when driven above 40 mph.  The sound of the engine via the tail pipe is second only to the Porsche in the roadster class.  Great safety is a given as is its long term durability.  Learning the features of the car and the interior buttons may take time.
car_4355,The Perfect Machine,"The lease was up on my 2006 E350 so I jumped into a 2008 SLK 280. The E350 is flawless but I needed more of a ""wow"" factor. The black exterior with the tan and black interior is stunning. This car is the perfect blend of performance and luxury. My SLK has Premium III (navigation) with the appearance package. The retractable hardtop is provides the ""wow"" factor. The fun of driving a convertible without the downside of a ragtop. My only other convertable was a 2003 Z4. The SLK provides more convenience, safety and luxury than the Z4. Remember, it's not how fast you go, it's how well you go fast."
car_4356,Just what I wanted.,"Choosing between the Boxster, Z4, Sky, and the SLK I chose the 280SLK with the Premium 1, appearance package, heating package, 7-speed automatic, & 6 CD changer. The others did not have the retractable hardtop, and other than the Boxster all felt like tin cans compared to this car. The SLK fits the bill I wanted for driving; not a race car but handles very well, not an economy car but who cares, and performs everything I ask it to do very well.  At 6' and 240# I have no problem entering and exiting, no problem with interior room, and am extremely comfortable on local or long distance drives. I am extremely happy the dealer, the salesman, and most of all the car.  Great purchase."
car_4357,MBZ SLK 55 AMG,"A bargain for what you get, as compared to others in it's class. Great engine power, speed and handling abilities. Fun to drive on the open road and in town. Great if you enjoy top-down motoring. Simply a fun and powerful hot-rod!"
car_4358,2008 SLK 350,"Have it for only two week and love it already. Great acceleration, very comfortable interior. Great looking car!"
car_4359,AMG Cobra!,"The SLK AMG 55 has great acceleration and adequate handling and braking. It has been difficult to find the right seat adjustment. The HVAC controls are confusing and difficult to see at night. The retractable hardtop has been fantastic but opt for the windscreen if you do a lot of top down driving. I do have some rattles in the top mechanism and around the glove box, both of which are annoying. The drivetrain of the AMG somewhat overwhelms the chassis in my opinion.  Keep in mind that the larger wheels and suspension make for a very firm ride, particularly on rough pavement. Repairs after hitting potholes are very expensive! Visibility just OK Overall a good car for this class but not great"
car_4360,Perfect first sports car,"Not very macho but outstanding performance.  Previously known as a ""secretaries sports car"" now has much better handling and performance but still has the bad rap.  While never being mistaken for Corvette or Porsche the SLK350 is probably a better owners car than either...easy to live with, good looking, low operating costs, fun to drive and undemanding...pretty nice car."
car_4361,Fun to drive,"Fun to drive, but with a few flaws. Reliability of electrical components has been less than satisfactory. Also, it goes through rear tires extremely quickly. I drive in a spirited manner, but certainly not aggressively. Not sure if I would buy again."
car_4362,SLK 350,"Never driven in snow or salt as I don't know how well it would do. New rear tires (had a nail in one).service maintained by Mercedes dealer in Gainesville, Fl. Love how the hard top automatically folds down into the back!! Bought the car as it was the show car on the floor in two different Mercedes Delerships. Not 100% sure of the color. May be a custom color..dark silver with a hint of dark blue. Car is washed,waxed, and babied on a regular basis. Never driven on poor road conditions ( pot holes) dirt roads and the like."
car_4363,MB Quality,"Overstated quality, overpriced car, dishonest dealers, and poor customer service all the way up the chain. Unusually high number of defects for any car."
car_4364,"Don't believe the Auto bloggers, this car is great and NOT a ""chick-car""!","I've had my SLK 350 for about a week. i am very happy that i went with this car. i spent a very long time researching and test driving various 'sports cars', and my decision came down to the CTS, Boxster, and the SLK 350. I took an afternoon to test drive all three, and decided the boxster just had too harsh of a ride for a daily driver, and the CTS lacked the convertible top.I spent the weekend driving around some of winding roads of Los angeles (palos verdes, malibu, and mullholland drive). this car is a great balance between 'fun sports car' and daily commuter! its sublte & subdue when you want it, and ultra-fast & nimble when you want it. a GREAT BALANCE!"
car_4365,"Peppy, fun sports car","If this is a midlife crisis I'm all for it! I recently purchased this used, original owner took great care of it. The 350 has a lot more pep than the 250, enough to make me pass on the 250. Either way, it has great road feel, lays low and tight to the ground, doesn't feel twitchy at all and yet it awakens when you simply tap the gas. I love driving it around with the top down. Well appointed, nice leather and controls, screen is a little small and I wish it was a touch screen. I have better nav and screen in my Toyota Avalon. Aside from that, a beautiful, elegant piece of machinery."
car_4366,Love to drive this car,"I have not owned a convertible since I was a teenager.  This car really takes you back.  It is so comfortable to ride in short or long trips.  We took it on a trip from Austin to Shreveport, LA. Got great gas mileage, the ride was very comfortable.  We only made one stop...bathroom break.  We were not tired when we arrived at our destination.  We take it on week-end trips often.  It just hugs the road.  My husband always wants to take ""the little car"", as he calls it.Here it is almost Thanksgiving and I still love driving my ""little"" car with the top down.  If you have never owned one and can afford to buy one (new or used) you should put this on your bucket list of things to do.  You won't regret it.2 - Now that I have owned this little car for over a year, I still LOVE it!! Love driving it, love riding in it and love the fact that heads turn when I pass by.  Guess I will keep it.Well, here it is, another year gone by.  I am still loving to drive my little convertible.  I still get a lot of looks from young and old.  I still get a lot of offers to buy it.  Just not ready to let go of this fun loving little car.  Maybe next year I will let someone else enjoy such a well made, fun to drive, good looking car.  They don't make the SLK250 anymore.  Very sad."
car_4367,I love my 2013 SLK250,"I bought this car used and had it for a month now.  It is a great car with good power and handling.  My other car is a 2011 BMW 535xi.  This hardtop convertible is just what I needed for summer months.  I hope it holds well.  I actually like to driver interface, controls and navigation better than those of BMW."
car_4368,Long term love (2009-2017),"Purchased in 2009 when I graduated highschool this was my first car ownership experience. When I got this I was looking at Honda S2000's but my parents had an affinity towards Mercedes-Benz so we agreed on this as a nice compromise. Owning this car through the past 8 years has been a pleasure.  Here is some of my experiences. 1) first car accident( rear-ended at red light) no visible damage but the Honda Civic was almost totaled by her insurance. 2) Repairs- cost $2,500 over 8 year term. So $312.50 average a year. This was mainly because I did a complete overhaul 3 years ago replacing all worn parts(suspension, motor mounts, drilled and slotted rotors and new pads, spark plugs, mass air flow, etc) before I started working in finance. Now i am in my final semester in my dual-masters program and in a few months I will tell my car goodbye and sell her for $5-6k with 155k mi. Note: I purchased this in 2009 for $10,500 so my total costs excluding the $75 oil changes was about $1k a year when you factor in my purchase price and resale value, not bad right? haha I must also include that during my past 3 years of ownership that this car doesn't pass NC inspection due to the MAF sensor. Oil gets caught up in this because after the car is around 12 years old the supercharger spits oil into the MAF. The next major issue is that the hydraulic powered hardtop's seals go bad after around 10 years in age and they leak into the headliner, I fix this by completely draining out the fluid for $25.  I passed inspection by getting a exemption permit each year. Now I will move on and purchase a Porsche Cayman S or 2013 Porsche 911. Although if you do sit in this slk you will see a strong resemblance between this and the 2007-2012 cayman interior. This car holds a special place in my heart, we went through undergraduate, corporate life and now graduate school together. I hope my experience shows you that Mercedes ownership is not expensive as one might expect."
car_4369,Great around town,"This is a great car to drive!  For around town driving, it has the right compromise between comfort and performance.  It's soft enough so that it is comfortable on the bump and pot hole ridden streets around where I live.  However, when on twisty roads in the country, it performs wonderfully at any speed you would drive on public roads. The 300 HP 3.5L V6 gives this car impressive straight line performance.  It's definitely not a Porsche, but it's not supposed to be...  The retractable hard top is wonderful considering the amount of rain we get.  Build quality is excellent - no squeaks or rattles to speak of and no other problems / issues after 1 year of ownership."
car_4370,Good Choice,I purchased the slk 300 in silver with chrome wheels with a lot of extras.  I was ready to buy the bmw z 35i but changed my mind.  The bmw is a nice car without a doubt as i just returned my 335i and can't complain about performance as it zoomed.  But surprise surprise the slk 300 is just breaking in and it flys too.  I was surprised when i hit it on the xway the other day i almost lost it.  I live in Southern California so traffic is heavy and my 300 holds its own.
car_4371,Z4 v SLK,I just returned my 2007 BMW 335i which is every car reviewers baby.  I bought the SLK 300 love it and would do it again.  I was really thinking about buying the new BNMW Z4 35I with that twin turbo 300 HP like my 2007 335i BUT I could not justify the price difference of some $260 more a month to my wife and BMW would not deal with me despite my steller credit.  I am not lead footed and don't street race so the difference in 1.1 sec from zero to 60 really doesn't matter.  I would have bought the 350 but again it was the price difference.  It is brand new with only a few miles on the car but I drove it enough to see what it has and I am happy with my choice.  Good Choice in a Sports Car !!!
car_4372,100% Owner Satisfaction,"SLK 300 6M.  Without doubt, I thoroughly enjoy owning this vehicle.  The pleasure begins with looking at it in the driveway.  The stability and cornering are remarkable. The engine power is a little tame in the 300, but I had to get this car with the manual transmission.  A surprising power band between 4-6k rpm makes the twisty roads a blast.  The retractable hard roof is effortless and sometimes I will put the roof down just to drive a few blocks."
car_4373,More logic than a Porsche,"I bought this car because 1- The retractable hard top (I hate soft tops) 2- Better comfort on the very bad roads of Province of Quebec. Road handling is not as good as a Boxter but the SLK is faster than the standard Boster and not so far behind a Boxter S. I would have had to buy the Cayman S but it's $20,000 more than the SLK350 and it's not convertible. I can hardly wait to get the new 2012 SLK 63."
car_4374,Fun Coupe or Convertible,"I did have a 98 230 SLK with 4k but was totaled by a drunk driver.  I purchased a 06 Chrysler Crossfire, thinking I would have the same experience and save money.  No comparing.  The SLK series Mercedes is one of the coolest convertible roadsters on the market. Performance, looks, roadster feel, with more class than most roadsters. I sold the Chrysler right away and began searching to replace the 230 with a newer 320 with no regret."
car_4375,No bells or whistles,"This car is especially fun to drive, even at slow speeds. With exceptional handling, acceleration cornering, the envious stares I get from other drivers are just icing on the cake. I love the automatic fold-and-stow hardtop, and the way the car feels when I'm in it. I also love the sound of the exhaust when I'm accelerating hard, especially when compared to my previous 4 cylinder turbo MazdaSpeed Protege.  This is a fun and prestigious car to drive and own. I'm glad I found it."
car_4376,I LOVE MY SLK,It is fun driving top down or up but I will srive it top down more weather permitting. It get's pretty darned hot here in Phoenix AZ in July.
car_4377,Exaclty What I was looking for!,"Car has a very solid construction. Comfortable for a sport roadster. Good on gas. I average 24 mpg on premium. Engine has enough power for an average driver, but being a 4 cyl is does not sound too smooth. The whining of the supercharger compensates a little, and bring some of the 'sport sound' to the car"
car_4378,2003 SLK230,"I've owned the SLK for a little over a year, and am very happy with it. I was initially attracted to the car because of its looks, styling, and impressive engineering. Supercharger provides enough of a boost for highway passing; otherwise, I would recommend a 320. Expectation met – with just one exception."
car_4379,Too Hot To Handle,"My 2003 SLK 320 is the result of my mid life crisis so says my lovely girl friend. If so, so be it. It is quick, agile, always turns heads. The fit and finish is perfect. Top up it is smooth quite and the Bose sound system is outstanding. Top down wind noise is minimal, and the fun factor is off the chart. And to top it off I consistently get 28/30 mpg on the freeway at a modest 65mph. Where else can you get head turner looks, performance of a V8, due to its light weight, and fuel economy as good or better than those little shoe boxes the car makers are trying to pawn off on us. Another bonus, parts are no more than an American car. Dealers are very reasonable."
car_4380,AMG ballistic missile,"The best all in one sports car ever made, it a great looking and quite coupe with the hard top up, a nice highway convertible with smooth air flow even at obscene speeds, easy to drive all day and moves a lot faster than the reviews (once it breaks in between 12 to 18K miles). It faster and less stressful to drive than the 911 I owned (with the rear engine) and more secure and solid feeling then the M3 I traded.  I also enjoy not having every kid in a z-car or Mustang changing me on the highway like in the 911 and M."
car_4381,Great Fun Car!,"Bought it used in 2006 and it had 13,000 miles. Now it has 20,000 miles. Changed the oil and filter myself and went with Castrol Full Synthetic instead of recommended Mobil 1 and it sounds good and seems to have better response.  It's pretty fast and it zooms through traffic with no problem. Be sure to turn off the traction control if you want to hear some screaming tires, otherwise you'll just jerk in low speed.  Mine seems to vibrate a little when in idle."
car_4382,Awesomelittle car,"I wanted a convertible but live on a dirt road so looked at hardtops. Glad I bought this one. It is fun to drive...way different than my BMW 525i. While my BMW is a great driving machine, it is heavy and moving the steering wheel requires some work. With this Mercedes its very  light and the steering wheel moves extrememly easily. I had to get used to the difference. Sometims I want more than a 2 seater, sometimes I want more room - but I made this choice - - the tradeoff I've made. Also the car is so low and my friends always groan getting in or out because it's hard to get in and out."
car_4383,"Fast, Fun Car","I love the handling of this car!  The acceleration is more than adequate, as the car gets off the line quickly, and it accelerates hard. With the AMG Sport package, the interior is very pleasing with the machined metal inserts.  At 80 MPH cruising speed across Nebraska, the gas mileage was 28.  The cockpit is roomy enough, and every control is close at hand.  So nice to have a convertible hard top, also, although the trunk capacity is limited with the top down.  Big enough for an ice chest, though."
car_4384,It's a 10!,"Fantastic automobile. The retractable 
hard top draws onlookers everytime it 
is used!  The interior trim and seat 
stitching is awesome!  It handles like 
it's on rails and it is very quiet for 
a small vehicle with the top up or 
down.  No problems after first year of 
ownership.  Even with roof retracted 
the trunk has some space to work 
with."
car_4385,"Sporty, fun, fast and power to spare!","I find my 2003 SLK-320 always fun to 
drive. It's a sporty and a real head 
turner going down the road. If the sun 
is out, the top is down. Or 25 seconds 
later it can be a hardtop again. You'll 
need to watch the speedometer because 
it is truly effortless to get to and 
exceed highway speeds. I love the 
throaty sound when I step on the gas. 
The motor eagerly responds at all 
speeds with ease. Comfortable seats and 
ride with plenty of legroom. Almost 
intuitive handling in turns, curves 
and ""other"" manuvers. The cockpit has 
well laid out gauges and controls. I've 
had no problems to date."
car_4386,good bang for the buck !,"The top operation is something to watch. 
This is just a fun car to drive around in. On 
the highway or on the city street it looks 
good and is lots of fun to drive."
car_4387,2003 slk320,"drives and handles extremely well and 
is a steal at the going rate"
car_4388,smart buyer,"this car was great except for the rear 
view visiblity-it was very hard to see 
behind the car...driver had to use side 
rear view mirrors to operate car."
car_4389,Raving in  Savannah,"This car is an eye catching machine. It 
turns heads with the top up or down. I 
am really impressed with the 
performance and the looks of the car. 
It is also comfortable to drive, even 
on long trips."
car_4390,Life is just a tad bit sweeter,"This car is the ultimate in class. 
Heads turn, you feel good, and look 
better driving this car. The car itself 
runs amazing and fails to dissapoint."
car_4391,It's good..,"I own a SLK 230 and I think that they 
are wonderful cars.  It has been a 
pretty reliable car, besides the fact 
that it has been wrecked and it has 
been a pain to get fixed.  I love my 
SLK, it's a small, eye-catching car."
car_4392,Happy to own a MB,"After test driving various makes and 
models, I decided to purchase this 
vehicle site unseen. I can't be 
happier. It's a perfect fit for me. I 
love the six speeds."
car_4393,Ford,"well i have always wanted one of these 
since i was little and i have always 
loved them and i mainly like it because 
its comfy drices good and goes fast and 
because of the hood"
car_4394,daveqmerc,"Exciting, nimble, a beautiful finish, 
great designer lines, functional, and 
great for cruising the back roads."
car_4395,Best of both worlds !!!,"I love my car!!!  When i retract the 
convertible hardtop, it never stops to 
amaze me with its superior German 
engineering.  Its a thrill, almost 
orgasmic, and to this day, passerby's
stop and watch in amazement.  I don't 
blame them, it still amazes me!!!  I 
have never loved a car so much... From 
my first convertible 20 yrs ago a Fiat 
124 Sport Spyder, to the overlooked 
Chrysler TC by Mazerati... This is by 
far the best convertible, and roadster 
i've ever owned."
car_4396,benz is best,"This car has an incredible ride. 
Handles nice and tight. i'm a small 
woman, this car fits me like a glove. I 
love the call in features: Emergency 
tracking, questions on repairs and 
information. The only complaint i have 
is, that the seat is on the hard side, 
typical for Mercedes. I lease the car 
and will probably not want to give it 
back. p.s. i drive the 4 seater CLK"
car_4397,slk320 experience,"fast, maneuverable, comfortable"
car_4398,WONDERFUL!!!!,"This is the best car that I have ever 
driven!!!! It is such a smooth ride and 
you get such a ""privliged"" feeling to 
be in it!"
car_4399,Fun to drive and a chick magnet,"This is a great car and the women love 
it!"
car_4400,Love That Baby Car!,"My SLK230 is sleek and sexy, just a joy
to see in my driveway. It is a very
solid car, with strong performance in
every day driving situations and even
stronger performance on lonely stretches
of highway! The trunk is amazingly large
for a convertible, even with the barrier
in place for dropping the top into the
compartment. The touch-shift
transmission brings you up to speed
in manual mode a bit quicker than the
automatic, and is a neat trick
to show unsuspecting passengers that you
can shift gears without a clutch. The
Firemist Red Metallic paint is a real
attention-getter. In the year that I
have owned it, the service and
reliability has been perfect."
car_4401,SLK230,"This 2003 SLK230 is my second SLK230, 
had a 1998 previously. I think it is a 
great car and, much better looking than 
the FAT looking Audis and similar cars. 
They look like bathtubs on wheels."
car_4402,What Fun,"Great car!  I have never had so much 
fun driving!  There is nothing I don't 
like about my SLK, it look great, fun 
to drive, and great handling.  If there 
would be one complaint it would be the 
fact a standard transmission is next to 
impossible to get."
car_4403,A happy customer,"In the nearly 12000 miles since 
purchase the car has performed 
flawlessly. Driving includes city and 
So Calif freeway as well as occasional 
mountian roads. More than enough power, 
but obviously not a dragster. I have 
developed a high level of confidence in 
this my 4th MBZ, but first roadster. 
Also have a 2000 E-320 which does not 
get driven as much as it used to."
car_4404,Burgandy Mercedes with beig interior.,"A girls car i have been told.  But, 
since I am a female that statement does 
not bother me.  I have had my car for 
about 2 years.  I drive it as a weekend 
vehicle.  I love the color and how it 
drives.  the engine runs very smooth, 
no complaints.  I am meticulous about 
it.  I do not think I will ever get rid 
of it.  It is a car that i can see 
having for years."
car_4405,SLK is a fun car to drive,"I purchased a used SLK earlier this 
year and it has lived up to all of my 
expectations. The car may not have the 
performance of a Porsche, but that 
doesn't mean it doesn't give me all I 
want when I pushed down the 
accelerator. The retractable hardtop is 
a fabulous feature. It provides 
security when you park it and 
protection from the elements when 
needed. It's an eye-catching car. Just 
put the top down at a gas station or 
somewhere close to a crowd and you'll 
get a lot of attention."
car_4406,Best Car Ever,"The Slk-230 model is the best and most 
reliable Mercedes - Benz car there is. 
Its really flashy, and has a great 
interior and exterior selection. If you 
are looking for a great summer car, 
this is the car for you. Also, the hard 
top convertable is awesome."
car_4407,my slk,"a wonderful car, i'd buy another in a 
heartbeat!!! gets more looks than 
either of my two harleys"
car_4408,Love mt SLK!,"This great little car is comfortable to 
drive on local errands and 9 hour 
across/state trips. The push button 
roof retraction is great, you can pull 
over and raise or lower the roof with 
the flip of a switch. Plenty of room in 
the trunk, with the top down, for two 
large M/B weekend duffle bags and 
portable golf club bags too! You gotta 
love it!"
car_4409,Fun car to drive,"I haven't owned the SLK 230 for very 
long, but I really enjoy the ride. 
Originally, my choice was between the 
SLK and the 350z convertible. When my 
neighbor came over and told us about 
the softtop of his M3 convertible being 
sliced, my husband decided on the 230 
because of the hardtop. I must admit 
that it is a great feature to have! I 
was concerned about the 4 cylinder 
engine pick-up, but the kompressor 
really helps to give it a kick when you 
need it. I live in a suburb of DC; 
since traffic is heavy quite often, it 
makes having a large engine such as the 
AMG a waste of money."
car_4410,My SLK,"I wish i can drive it top down more but 
the weather on the east coast does not 
allow for it!  because of the hard top, 
it's still sleek, sexy and fun to drive.
Although the cargo space looks small, i 
fit several cases of wine and luggage 
with the top down on my way back from 
vacation this summer!!!"
car_4411,Great Performance car for daily use,"The car had no problems upon delivery. 
I had only one minimal repair 
(a defective door contact for the 
interior light) after 24 000 miles of 
driving. Oil consumption was minimal. 
Acceleration is tremendous, the car 
handles very competently and the 
brakes are outstanding. The Xenon-
lights are definitely worth the money. 

All this makes the car a lot of fun to 
drive, in particular in the summer. I 
have to use the car in the winter as 
well and I was surprised that it is 
drivable in snow as long as you treat 
the accelerator like a raw egg. I used 
Bridgestone Blizzak LM 22 tyres on AMG 
rims (tirerack.com) for the winter."
car_4412,Rocket,"The acceleration and handling makes you 
want to drive it all day long. This car 
gives me the most enjoyment of any car 
I drove in the past, including Corvette 
2000, BMW 535, Infiniti Q45, Porsche 
911 ('77). The Audi A4 Quattro comes 
close."
car_4413,MErcedes-benz rox!!,"The engine is great!!  It rides really

car_4415,The Most Fun In Years!!,"After test driving most of the new 
ragtops I decided to buy the SLK320.  
The sleek styling, powerful engine and 
well appointed interior made the 
decision easy.  I wanted a car that not 
only looked and acted with finess but 
also was safe. I found all this in the 
SLK320. The retractable hardtop was a 
little extra, that I readily embraced 
as a BIG plus. I would recommed anyone 
who is looking at this car to try both 
the SLK230 and the SLK320. I believe 
the difference in price is nominal to 
the preformance that the 320 offers.  
The trunk on this car is adequate for a 
couple of small duffle bags, or a half 
dozen grocery bags."
car_4416,Hope you like attention...,"SLK 32 AMG is rare as any AMG models.  
I have yet to see another AMG in 
downtown Chicago.  So definitely get 
used to getting stared at, guys nodding 
their heads, and girls waving hi.  This 
car can definitely keep up if not out 
pace the M classes and most Porsches.  
Bought the 320 back in December but was 
not satified with the acceleration so 
when the first AMG came in I was all 
over it.  One thing for sure, this 
summer is going to be fun."
car_4417,Great car,"I have my SLK 32 for almost three 
months now. Great car. Would love a 
manual transmission, though. Stereo 
could be a bit better. Retractable roof 
is great. Acceleration is out of this 
world. A bit rare, but it took me less 
than 5 months of waiting time. All in 
all: Highly recommended!"
car_4418,Car needs work,"Car is not reliable -- third trip to 
dealer in three months.  Avoid!"
car_4419,WOW great car,"I love this car. It is lots of fun and 
you get lots of comments. The Hard top 
is a great feature; if you have the 
misfortune of have bad weather when you 
are driving the car. The 320 has nice 
power in all gears. Other convertible 
driver remark on how nice the SLK is."
car_4420,THE Car for fun and comfort,"As with most Mercedes vehicles, the 
car is exceptionally well behaved and 
controlled so that you don't realize 
how fast you are accelerating, 
cornering or braking.  The 320 engine 
is the standard of the line and is 
tuned and geared appropriately for 
this type car.  Wind noise with the 
top down is minimal with the roll bar 
curtain in place.  The five speed 
automatic works fine, but would 
recommend the 6-speed which is 
standard. 

The interior is gorgeous -- I have 
black and red with a silver exterior --
the traditional Mercedes sport colors. 
Never cease to enjoy driving this car!"
car_4421,slk mercedes-Benz,Best car I've ever owned.  No problems!
car_4422,Great car for  women,"I have had the Year 2000 model for 3
years.  No major problems except for the
roof which the dealer fixed under
warranty.   I have NO COMPLAINTS.  It's
an incredibly reliable, fun, fast car. 
My husband (who weighs 315 pounds) loves
to drive it because it zooms faster than
his Chevy Tahoe.  This is a great car
for women because it is flashy but
reliable, its lines are sleek but brief.
 It's not expensive (compared to an SL
or a Jag) and it's sexier.  I love this
car.  Buy it for your wife.  Buy it for
your mistress.  Buy it for yourself (I
did -- on my 40th birthday)"
car_4423,32AMG is superb,"I bought the car one year ago and have 
been thrilled with my purchase.  The 
engine is surprisingly quick and 
receives jealous stares from others on 
the road.  I used to buy cars with

Trouble with noisy cabin air filter

The clutch/shifter a bit notchy but 
smoothed out around 7k.  29 mpg with 
commutes.  Curvy roads are a blast.  
Top down in seconds.  
First gear a bit short, taking off from 
the light hits with 2nd.  3rd is a 
delight.  6th allows it to stretch 
out.  I only wish there were more 
opportunities to let it run.

Great comments from everyone.  I often

car_4428,2003 Mercedes Benz SLK320,"Have been waiting years to buy one. 
Drove one this Oct. and bought it. 
Great car!!"
car_4429,Better But Not Best,"The obvious pluses concerning this vehicle is the style, image, and the retracting hard top. The selling feature for me was the hard top convertible. This year's model has some minor improvements, the engine and its improved horse power and 0-60 speed put it in the running with the entry level Porsche.  Unfortunately, I've driven both and the Porsche is still the better of the two.  My 350 SLK is sexy in a girly kind of way.  The Porsche is way more sport car than Mercedes is capable of building. I regret that I didn't spend more to get the car of my dreams.     My wife's vote (and veto of the Porsche) cinched the deal and the SLK won the deal."
car_4430,2009 SLK 300,Mercedes Benz really got this one right!  I got the 1st one from the dealership!  it looks so much like the SLR Mclaren in the front as well as the back with the trapezoid exhaust and diffusers.  The bluetooth works fantastic. Redesigned steering wheel and gauges set this apart from the 2008 models. Color is Mars red with beige leather. The key fob remote transforms the solid coupe into a Roadster in no time! Traded in a 2006 Mazda Miata which is a terrific Roadster but does not compare in terms of Luxury and  feel of this!  Would highly recommend this if you are looking for the best of both worlds!
car_4431,Love this Car!,"This is my 3rd SLK and the only problems I have experienced are a dead battery (replaced by Mercedes Roadside Assistance in my driveway) and a fading of the 2 rear window panels (replaced under warranty by dealership).  The electronic convertible top function is smooth, quick, easy to operate, and surprisingly there is room for 2 - 3 weekend soft bags in the trunk with the top down. The interior is small but not cramped. Even on long trips it remains very  comfortable (Yosemite, Park City).  I have owned a Porsche, BMW and Alfa Romeo GT and my SLK is by far the best sports car I have ever owned! I live by the beach and there is no greater experience than cruising the Coast Hwy with the top down on a warm summer night."
car_4432,2016 MB SLK300,Great little sports car. Fun!
car_4433,Great little car... BUT major issue found.,"Firstly this is the second SLK I have owned.  The first being a brand new 2014/ (2015) SLK250 model.  The first 6 months it ran like a dream, and then during winter, I noticed an odor occasionally coming into the car.  The closest description that I could offer, that other passengers identified too, was like a burning crayon smell.  I tried to work out when it was occurring, and the possible cause.  After a few months of deliberation, a myself and a few passengers of my vehicle came to the conclusion that the anti-corrosion materials (coating) used in the body of the car, had was melting a low heating point, and at some point hitting hot parts in the engine compartment.  This would start out as a slight odor, but over the coming months intensify as the days got hotter, to a bad odor, and fumes that were now getting into the cab of the car, with the top up, or down.  I reported this to the dealership, and it was a game of tennis over about 4 more months going back and forth with them trying to replicate the problem when they were in possession of the car.  They reported it to the regional technical rep (in NJ not far from MB USA headquarters), and after the first attempt of adding more of the soundproofing materials to the engine compartment bulkhead, and stripping the doors and cleaning them out from a very large amount of the anti corrosion / wax substance, seemed to make the issue worse.  The dealership did was as helpful as they could be, but handed me off to corporate to try to come to a resolution.  The only resolution that could have corrected the car, was to strip it down to the frame/body, and dip it in a bath that would remove all the anticorrosion materials and start again.  Not practical on any car, so I was offered a buy back deal.  After many months of passenger headaches, myself wheezing and breathing issues from the car, a settlement was reached to buy back the car and purchase a 2016 model (SLK 300), which I currently own.  Now my theory was, that a different model, at a completely different time off of the production line should be far enough away from the original car in time etc, that is should not have the same problem.  The old SLK 250 you could see the wax like substance coming out of the door through the rubber grommets and dripping down, also from the engine compartment when you opened the door etc.  Now I have had the new SLK 300 for a period of 5 months when I started to notice the same problem.  Starting with a slight wax/crayon smell, and as the next few month rolled on, and the heat of summer hit on top of the cars engine heat, the exact same issue with fumes coming into the car, when driving, generally any speeds above 40 mph with the top up or down.  With all this, I can only assume it's the entire production line that has this issue, and the routings in the car's assembly instructions and details have had too much of this compound specified so as to prevent rust, but not melt at low temperatures and overspill to the engine compartment and hot parts around the bodywork.  A complete shame, and downside of an otherwise fun, and fantastic car to drive.  True roadster, and enjoyable drive.  With this, happening, and from what I can find using google across the last 5 - 8 years of owners, I am not the only one with this problem.  I can NOT in any way recommend this car to anyone, or say I will every buy  this model of car again, and as it was such a fight to get Mercedes to recognize the problem the first time around, would probably never buy a Mercedes again, even if this issue was limited to this Model of car.  If you find this review helpful, then my job is done.  If you decide to take the gamble, I can only offer you good luck, and hoping your car/model does not have this issue, you have as much fun as I have had driving this car, prior to these issues arising.  GOOD LUCK, and FUN SAFE DRIVING."

There is power when you want it and braking when you want it, all wrapped up in fabulous German engineering.Why can't we build cars like this?

looks that you get, and the enjoyment 
of driving it makes it one of the best 
cars I've owned."
car_4444,6 month toy,"The looks this car gets are off the 
charts, but they come at a hefty 
price. I only drive my SL500 6 months a 
year. Therein lies the problem; already 
expensive cost of ownership, 
exacerbated by spreading the costs over 
only six months. That said, I still 
keep it, and wait for the spring to 
bring nice weather.  The thrill of 
hitting the accelerator on this 300+ HP 
beast is beyond compare.  Driving with 
the top down on a nice day is one of 
the finest auto experiences around.  
Then, pulling into valet parking of a 
crowded cafe or club is bound to stroke 
the ego of any redblooded American male."
car_4445,"Beautiful Car, Ugly Payment","I've loved this car; it's my sixth pre-
owned Mercedes. It's red and gets a lot 
of attention; it has been reliable and 
fun. I bought a 1991 Mercedes station 
wagon for the dogs to ride in; I'm 
picky about my baby! It flies and is 
beautiful inside and out. I'm cautious 
about parking it -- it gets door dings 
and scratches and white paint, so it's 
touched up once or twice a year. People 
apparently are jealous and vandalize it."
car_4446,Roadster Rules!,"I've owned my '95 sl 600 roadster now

chip the previous owner had installed, 
the horsepower rating goes from 389 to 
432!  

Things to watch out for...  seems like 
these cars are prone to need new 
catalytic converters at around 40k 
miles.  Mine did..and fortunately it 
was covered by mercedes  8-year, 80k 
mile e/c warranty--thereby saving me 
$4k!  !      low mileage '97 or '98

car_4447,Bittersweet,"Although I loved this car, we have since parted ways.  I could not have been more dissapponted with my SL experience.  For the 3 years I owned the car I found that there is a huge cost of ownership that comes with maintaining this car.  Service costs were more than the payments.  I was always told that these cars would run very high mileage, but that mileage comes at a heafty cost.  I would not buy another unless it was under the Starmark warrantee."

car_4450,Great Car for Wife,"Wife doesn't care about acceleration and she is small women, so car fits her perfectly.  Loves the quite ride an comfortable drive."
car_4451,Loving it! Highly recommended,"I have always been a fan of the SLK.  I traded in my 2004 to a 2014 and I was not disappointed.  Great handling, drives like an SUV on highway.  Even my mechanic could not believe how quiet it is.  Keyless fob also open windows and tops remotely.  Surprisingly large cargo space for a convertible when the top is not in the trunk.  Love the vintage race car design, especially the grill.  A little disappointed with how much it cost to keep up with the most updated navigation system as well as the very limited length of the lightening cable specifically designed for the vehicle for the iPhone.  (Which means you cannot use a regular USB/lightening cable without taken up your USB slot.) It's a little hard to get in and out especially if you are tall or parked at a tight spot.Now that I see the 2018 model, I love the design (2012-2017) even more.  I know not everyone is worrying about the look, but I think the longer nose leading to the grill really make a difference to the interior leg room and the cooling of the car."
car_4452,"Great handling, great lines, great looks!","This is my 3rd convo and while the smallest this is the most enjoyable and rock solid. While biased others might rate the Z4 & A4 higher/better the SLK has plenty of power and an esoteric aura the others lack. Other MB drivers render a salute just like bikers, they know the feel! The hard top retracts and closes quickly and offers silence protection that soft tops can't match. This is a fun roadster!"
car_4453,Classic Mercedes SL500 Still a Great Value,"The r129 chassis is considered by many to be the entry for Mercedes into the new age of computer assisted design. Coupled with engineering excellence this model has outstanding comfort, roadholding, safety and looks. Advances in technology have produced more powerful models and styling has changed but the r129 offers superb value when you consider that a low-mileage $100,000 automobile (and that's 1999 dollars!) can be had for less than $10,000. A very capable grand tourer."
car_4454,Classic Roadster,I bought the SL 500 with 32K miles.The car has lots of sex appeal.It is fun to drive and the handling is amazing.I bought the car on E-Bay.The seller under promised and over delivered.The car is all original and the owner had all up to date records.The car draws a lot of smiles of approval.I can see the car as a true classic and the resale potential for price appreciation is definitely there.On a scale of 1-10 it's a 91/2.Drive one and you'll see what I'm talking about.
car_4455,Spoiled Rotten,"I saw it sitting in the dealership waiting for me to buy it! I did!! Best deal and amazing car to drive. It's response is great, well brakes could use some help. It's made up with the intant brake lock when it picks up you want brake NOW. Love It!! Everything will recommend it and I'm planning to upgrade soon to the new version."
car_4456,Better MPG than you think,"I fell in love with my first SL as a twelve year old, when I saw the most beautiful champagne 450SL in a showroom for seventeen thousand dollars.  As midlife approached I was able to afford a used 1999 SL500.  I have driven over 50,000 trouble free miles and have consistently averaged over 20 miles per gallon.  I believe the 129 model(90-01) is the least expensive to own from the perspective of a Mercedes-Benz mechanic."
car_4457,A Great Roadster,"I have owned this car for for about a 1.5 yrs now. The only problem I had with it was a speaker in the door going out and I had to replace the hood pad that was falling apart. Other than that nothing at all. I bought it with 78K in great condition. A very fun and great looking car, lots of power and with the windscreen up you can hardly tell the top is down. The only negatives are the rear window creasing and the poor lighting of the non-xenon headlights, other than that this car is a dream to drive. I am very happy with the SL500, like poetry in motion, enjoy the drive, this is a one in a million automobile for the discriminating owner. With the prices of a used SL it is a real bargain."
car_4458,1999 sl 500,"Although a fun car to drive, the quality and workmanship leaves a lot to desired. Surprisingly good gas mileage for this car. The chassis bolts had to be retightened after 45K miles. the knobs on the vents broke off. the plastic cover around the sun visors have broken and oil leaks from this area???? Trunk must be opened with key 75% of the time because the button in the car and on the key doesn't work. speed control lever fell off. Driver door arm rest disfigured just by resting arm on it. Part of grille fell off (not caused by accident). Replaced water pump at 55K miles. glove box opening mechanism broke. Didn't have as many problems with my old Ford Pinto."
car_4459,SO RIGHT!,"I purchased the car with under 10K miles, have only driven 4K in first year.  Everything works and it is a blast to drive.  Gorgeous car turns heads, great stereo, rock solid feel.  Just wish the seats were more comfortable -- not terrible, just not terrific."

The auto-pullup windows are kind of awkward. The break- pedal travels toofar before stopping making easy stops difficult until you get used to the car. It can use a backseat and a larger trunk. The gas mileage is around 16 in city and 22 on freeway, as high as 26 on straight freeway.

Many reviews have spoken disparagingly about this series of SL so I had some concerns about its longevity. So far it has been perfect after 18 months of ownership.  The performance is exhiliarating but my best surprise is my fuel mileage.  In the city I get a consistent 22MPG while on the road it is 26MPG or better.

I had an emergency fund in place fully funded and so far it's been in the shop for some ball joints in the suspension, an intercooler pump (which is upgraded so it shouldn't break for a while) and couple of new rims because the 2 left got bent. I've replaced the alternator, crank shaft position sensor, engine and cabin air filters, a few pulleys and a valve cover gasket. It's going to need trunk struts, accumulator spheres, engine/transmission mounts and a few cosmetic touch ups (but overall my car is in really good shape). This car has costed me $2,000 in the first year to get caught up on maintenance which is cheap for a car like this at 14 years old. The engine was shutting off on it when it got warmed up not too long ago. I was able to diagnose the problem in less then 15 minutes at a cost of less then $28. It was the CPS and it was a breeze to install once I got it (took 10 minutes) and every local auto part shop had it in stock. I replaced the alternator myself on it as well and once you know the procedure it's easy to replace. You need to remove the fan shroud and it will make it easier but it was a breeze as well. This is a very easy car to work on. The hood opens 90 degrees and theres a lot of room to work almost like an old muscle car. The struts and brakes cost a lot retail but you can find them so cheap to nothing if you shop around so the parts are usually very cheap and sometimes free in my experience if you send the old ones in. The engine parts are almost all metal and you don't have to worry about anything breaking unless you over tighten stuff. The car gets terrible overall fuel economy but it's very fast and the acceleration is brutal in a way. There are a few quality problems but they're very small and the average person wouldn't be able to find them. The quality of materials and build quality is overall extremely high for this vehicle especially when you consider it's from the DaimlerChrysler era. It's got a tank like Mercedes-Benz build quality to it. It feels very solid and heavy and the doors are very heavy. The transmissions in these vehicles shift very slow and are a bit cumbersome but are basically the same as you'd find in a Sprinter van or almost any other Mercedes in this time period and is found in almost every V12 Mercedes until 2014 or so. You can also find it in many Chrysler vehicles like V8 Grand Cherokees, 300's, Chargers, Challengers, Durangos, you name it. It's even in some Jaguars and 911's. It's a very heavy duty unit and can run for 100's of thousands of miles. When you need to replace it just make sure it has the correct torque converter and you're golden. The unit should be pretty cheap. This is a very intuitive car. I am not a technician or expert and I can easily diagnose anything in this car in 15 minutes or less. Make sure the hydraulic fluid has been getting changed though before you buy one because the car rides on a fully active hydraulic suspension and one pump runs the suspension and steering. If the fluid is not changed before 50k miles at least, the pump will fail, the lines will get clogged and it can ruin your struts. It can total out your car if someone is careless about this and should be done every 30k along with the transmission fluid or even 20k if you can. This is the only thing you have to worry about. The engine mounts go out early because they're filled with fluid and are soft to make the car ride and settle better so that's normal. Supercharger oil should be done every 20-30k as well and make sure you lubricate the seals and the top. Overall if you listen to what Mercedes tells you to do and do more than what is expected and are good to your car you will be rewarded with one of the most reliable vehicles on the market. 1,000,000 miles on one of these is not uncommon and can go possibly 2,000,000 miles between rebuilds. It's a very solid and simple single overhead cam engine. It's not hard to maintain. Make sure you have an emergency fund in place though. You should have one anyways and it should have at least $12,000 in it."
car_4476,The feeling of being on train tracks!,"A head turning beauty, you will never get tired of saying ""Thank You"" when hearing others compliment it's ego building style."
car_4477,Near Flawless Vehicle Even 14 Years Old!,"Not sure about all the negative comments. I bought this car for my wife as she has always wanted a convertible and geez you just can't go wrong with MB. I bought it over a year ago. It was a 2003 with 29,000 miles on it! I bought it in 2016. The car has never been in accidents and appears to have regular maintenance from records. We have put 8000 miles on it since owning it and almost all the original components are on it and have not failed with one exception (see further below). We do not drive it in the Minnesota winter. The car has been near flawless, fun, reliable,  extremely comfortable, and surprisingly a good handling car. It's the whole deal. While it does not have the power my RS6 does, nor equal the cornering and braking of my Porsche or RS6....the comfort and styling just can't be matched. I would rather drive this car than the others. I was so impressed with this car I bought an AMG MB days after. The only thing that does not work is the lumbar control in the driver's seat. We are still on the original brake pads and only have had to do one oil change."
car_4478,Style and performance,"If you have the 18 sport wheels with performance tires they will only last about 10,000 miles in the tears. Every where I go with this car it's still a head turner for a 2003 with a style that will always look new.Update 70,000 miles abs light came on and checked fluid it was low, added fluid OEM and all is good, thought I might need pump but I believe due to heat evaporation there was some loss. Added jdm front tower strut bar for less flex, k&n air filters with improved power and saved gas by 4 mpg. Lowering links dropped car 2 1/2 inches. Now will be installing new exhaust! Truly a great driving machine and a head turner!"
car_4479,"Please, stay away!","Seeing the price of these cars on the used market is a tempting purchase. When everything is working it is overall a fantastic car, fast, good looking, comfortable, etc.HOWEVER: REGARDLESS of what anyone tells you, I doubt there is a more complicated and unreliable car on the market. In under one year, I have spent over $8,000 on unplanned repairs. This is not because the car wasn't maintained, they are just chronically unreliable. Suspension issues, getting stuck in park, trunk leaks, rattles, motor/transmission mounts, supercharger intercooler pump, alarm siren, trunk struts, this is a partial list of the problems that I've had.Most of the reviews on here are overwhelmingly positive, but you need to see the dates - many 10+ years ago when the car was newer. Most recent reviews will attest to my warning: DO NOT LET THE LOOK/DRIVE OF THE CAR TEMPT YOU.The car moved from a ""love/hate"" relationship to a ""mostly hate"" relationship after being in the shop at least once a month.Oh, and as a daily driver over 14k miles it has averaged 13.5mpg in the suburbs, but you should know that going in - it costs to go fast.In summary, there is no such thing as a cheap MB SL, you're paying in depreciation or you're paying in maintenance, pick your poison."
car_4480,Known Lemon. Every One of Them. Stay Far Away!,"Mercedes is well aware of all the ABC failures on their SL500s & SL550s,  but are still allowed to sell them in the United States. There is a VERY dangerous problem if you are driving at the time of the failure. Imagine a shock suddenly coming off a vehicle at 65 MPH?!? Not imagine that EACH AND EVERYONE of the vehicle sold that year fail. 100% FAIL. Sound like a class action lawsuit? You would think so, but some how Mercedes Benz is able to still push lemons out the door. This is not just plain greed, it is a complete lack of value for human life! I have completely lost all respect for Mercedes Benz."
car_4481,POORLY BUILT CAR,Just sold my 2003 SL 500 Designo had it for  7 years too many trips to the dealer for repairs a car with only 3300 miles had more problems than it should have had for a supposed quality car.Dealer told me don't keep this car without a warrantee at cost of $6800.00 The car lost to much value when sold.This car is a money pit needs expensive repairs every month. Great looking but not reliable stay away.
car_4482,Oh damn its broke again.,"Seems like this car has been in the shop more than it has been on the road the last 2 years I bought the car 2.5 years ago with 80,000 miles on it. It now has 100,590 It has a ton of service records on it. If its not the ABC going down its the SRS system or this week its the SOS flashing and then the trunk will not open and now the AC has quit and the shop says its going to be expensive to fix. Its just one thing after another. Thinking about parking it in the front yard and filling it with dirt and making it a very expensive planter."
car_4483,Electrical Gremlins Abound,"Car has left me stranded and in need of towing 5 times now in 3 years.  It has so many electrical problems that no one can figure out, the last time I took it to the dealer for the same thing and spent $3,000 with no real fix.  Looks good, is very fast but too heavy to be a real sports car, it drinks gas, and is very unreliable and expensive to own.  Another thumbs down for Mercedes' recent product offerings, do you research and you'll find many reports of their shoddy quality in their modern cars."
car_4484,Amazing to drive & horrific to own,I have owned over twenty Mercedes and this has been the most exciting to drive and yet the worst for reliability. The quality of the cabin components are cheap and tacky and a disgrace to the badge and the electronics are a complete nightmare. I cannot trust any of the onboard warning systems and my repair bills to try and get them sorted is like paying off the national debt. The depreciation on this vehicle has been alarming and I am so disappointed that this will probably be the last Mercedes Benz I will purchase.
car_4485,Never Had Better....BUT,"I have had many cars but this car has to be the best all around car ever.It is the ultimate GT car,sports,coupe convertible,luxury and hot rod.I don't believe there is a car in the world that works better in a combined package.I can't wait to get my four year old 2009 SL65 at a $100,000.00 + discount. I'm pretty sure I got mine for about the cost of a new loaded mini van..."
car_4486,It's all about appearances.,"This is the most beautiful car I have owned...really turns heads.  Interior would score equally high but for the use of too much hard, cheap plastic.  Handling and power are just okay, hampered by the excessive weight of the car.  Problem is, such a striking exterior design and the high price raise expectations of super performance and quality materials.  Not the case.  Leather is cracking and discoloring.  Paint seems thin; chips easily  Also, lots of noise coming from under the car, like gears whining, bearings grinding, yet everything is okay.  Noise level is unacceptable in car of this rank.  Dealer service has been great, but parts are ridiculously expensive.  Not a great drive."
car_4487,Red,"This is my 7th red SL in 25 years, so I'm pretty well pre-sold. I really loved my '97 SL500, but the 2003 is really a joy, and no more messing with the tops. On a 50+ mile trip at 65MPH it clocks better than 24MPG, goes to 15-17MPG when ""romping"" on it, but hey, that's why we buy red sports cars, isn't it? The CD-based NAVI stinks compared to my 2007 ML AMG, but you can't get lost in an SL anyway. As always, gets lots of eyeball, and is  fun to drive!  I've also owned Porches and Jags, but like the SL best. Worth every penny!"
car_4488,Great Car Lotsa Fun,"This is a an exeptional vehicle, hardtop convertible roadster. This is my second one with AMG package on it just not supercharged. I highly recomend this car to every one"
car_4489,Stay away!,"As a starter the value of that car is dropping like a rock in a lake with no bottom. The real trade in value is between  $25000.00 and $31000.00 at best. I was lucky to buy it with a POC on it otherwise I would have left my wallet at the dealer. Lots of squeaking and annoying noise coming from the chassis. Lots of problem with the electronic, seat wont recline and suddenly they do, the lighting. The air ride suspension is nice but unreliable and can collapse at any time. They had to replace the whole rear end at 48000 miles. Please stay away from Mercedes benz and leave MB where they deserve to be, in bankruptcy."
car_4490,Excellent Car!,I drove the Lexus convertable and fell in lust. But not until I drove the 2003 MB 500 SL that I fell in love! Great steering radius and serious power and performance. MB is back!
car_4491,My Retirement Gift,"I could not be happier with the purchase of my 2003 500SL.  Its performance, luxury appointments, and over all wow factor is amazing. I never thought that a retired school teacher would be fortunate enough to own a car of this quality."
car_4492,None better!,"I've owned 4 MB's, a Porsche, and numerous other European vehicles. I've driven them all for pleasure. None for day to day. I've never had a MB that dissappointed me..including my SL500. My Porsche 996 was in the shop every other week..literally, for ""check engine lights. It never was resolved. Save your money and buy this car. I'm over 6'6"", and wide, and am comfortable. Interior design is remarkable. The car is in the shop for scheduled maintenance only. Come to think of it, I don't know that I've ever had a major problem with any MB. It's fast, sleek, handles on a rail, looks fabulous, runs magnificently. I don't know what else I could ask for. I'm just glad that I bought this car."
car_4493,2003 Certified Used SL55,"I purchased a 2003 certified Diamond Silver SL55 avoiding the $50K depreciation. What a car.  Incredible looks and power, and a great sounding rumble.  The car is truely amazing, yet the navigation is dated years compared to Lexus.  I have no regrets in the first 2,000 miles.  I have heard both positive and negative reviews for the car so I purchased the extended warranty to 100K miles.  It appears to be hit or miss with some of the cars with the research I've done."
car_4494,SL500 is a dog,3 years and 20K miles of nothing but trouble. brakes and battery/electrical problems constantly. Been towed in 4X. Gave up on it so it now looks great sitting in the garage!
car_4495,SL55 just OK,"I have had this car since Nov 2002, but don't drive it much. The car is fast ,but drive by wire needs work [touchy brakes and lack of trottle response at times is dangerous. I had a defective digital display which was replaced but not improved. The dealer refused to let me speak to factory rep. After a year,  I finally got the dealer to compare to another SL and they finally fixed it. Stereo amp blew out and had to be replaced. Sound system is average at best. Why do you have to push a button to use the steering wheel shift controls? Command center is way too complex. Nav system is very difficult and inaccurate. A stunning car, but I prefer to drive my 1998 Corvette Convertible."
car_4496,Fast but Unreliable,"Yes, fast, beautiful and fun to drive but that's where it ends.  The car has been back to the dealer three times in 7000 miles for mostly electronic related problems, twice on a flat bed. The latest is a bad alternator causing the computer to flash a red stop sign at me with an alarm blaring and a warning that the brakes were about to fail. Have to wait a week for the part because not one is available in the US.  The navigation system is useless and the sound system inferior to say that of a Lexus 340SC.  Scared to drive this thing any distance now and looking to trade her in sadly."
car_4497,Whiplash,"Fastest car I've ever had the pleasure to drive.  The ""Car"" is well built, but don't trust Germans with electronics, that's best left the the Japanese."
car_4498,This Car is incredible,Imagine a car that has everything one could ask for. This car was built for someone who wants a daily driver that is fun as hell and fits like a glove. Driving this car is like eating the perfect meal.
car_4499,Awesome,Awesome car! i wouldnt change a thing!
car_4500,SL 2003,"I love my SL, but the one thing I miss 
is room in the trunk."
car_4501,Beautiful but unreliable,"I bought my SL500 in Jul-03. 
But ownership is blighted by consistent 
unreliability and visits to Mercedes 
service. SL parts are often not 
available, so your car sits, un-
drivable, in the repair shop waiting 
for parts.
In 10 mths I spent a month in loan 
cars, whilst waiting for parts & 
repairs. Mercedes paid for everything, 
but that does not take away the 
irritation.
This week’s fault is the seat-belt 
(unsafe to drive, 10 day for parts); 
previous failures were hydraulics 
(undrivable), exhaust (illegal to 
drive) and electric seat adjustment 
stuck in fully forward (couldn’t enter 
seat).

if you want something reliable."

simply marvelous. I have the smell

MB of Annapolis sold it to me knowing 
it, then promised to fix it (had the 
car three weeks after I only had it a 
week), and it needs to go back in. They

Annapolis has seen its last dollar from 
me, and I would recommend anybody else 
staying away from them too."

easily ( there is a pending classaction

car_4541,Great long-distance cruiser,"This car doesn't really need a review since it's impractical from the start. You already know it can't carry seven people, drive on a dirt road or pick up a 60"" flat-screen from Best Buy. But put the top down and the interior can be comfortable at 70mph. The looks draw attention. The ride smooths out bad roads just enough. Handling is good enough to enjoy curves and mountain roads. We got snow tires and drive year around in Colorado."
car_4542,Might as well throw $ out window,"I have owned this car for almost 10 years, it was serviced regularly and timely. I drove my car daily back and forth to work which was only about 12 miles one way, a full tank of gas lasted two weeks. The first year the paint faded, had it replaced faded again. Fresno Mercedes-Benz did not advise me on any repairs. Around turns the acceleration did not always go, even though it was very fast straight away it did not accelerate well after turns. I had to ask why my car squeaked, found out it needed oiling. The leather seats are ripping on the edges from getting in and out of the vehicle. I would complain about a problem and the service department would not address the problem, tell me nothing was wrong when they checked it, like the trunk not unlocking when you tried to open it, even though I took a video to prove it....April of 2017 my transmission failed, not once did my light go off or did I have any handling issues. I debated getting it repaired because the resale value is only about $8,000 -matching the repair cost!!! Got that repaired and the Sept 2017 motor mounts went out so dumped money to replace that. 3 days ago, I noticed a leak on both front corners of the roof top, so I put the top down to investigate and the hydraulic fluid came pouring out of my roof NOW convertible top wont move up or down and it is stuck with the trunk lid half way open! I am just trying to figure out how to emergency close to trade in for another car, hopefully they take the car. The car didn't even last a 10 year anniversary. I WILL NEVER BUY MERCEDES again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
car_4543,Our 2007 Mercedes SLK 280,Be sure there are only two people to transport.
car_4544,Boss Benz,"fun-loving open-air roadster and a cozy, secure coupe. The dual personality comes courtesy of a hardtop roof that retracts with the touch of a button. As with its main competitor the BMW Z4, this ability to transform gives this small 2-seater a degree more practicality. Mercedes' compact convertible touts a plusher ride compared to its more dynamic BMW rival yet still offers a good blend of power and handling.If you want a premium roadster with a hardtop roof that protects against the elements and offers a supple ride that coddles on your daily commute, it's hard to beat the Mercedes SLK. The SLK look and feel more like the ultra-luxurious SL, Mercedes' entry-level roadster. The SLK-Class brought retractable hardtops into the mainstream when the roadster debuted in 1998, and it's still setting the pace. Such a setup delivers a delicious automotive duality: In less than 20 seconds, the SLK can transform from buttoned-down coupe to sun-seeking convertible.Want turn heads? Pull up in this!"
car_4545,Missed the mark,"While the SLK 280 is a fun convertible to drive, Mercedes missed the mark on a number of fine points.  With top down, wind noise negates any conversation or music listening.  The cup holders are poorly made and located in a position that blocks your view to the right.  The weight (lack of) of the car makes it very dangerous to drive in the rain.  It floats and hydroplanes in puddles.  Storage is extremely limited and the glove box is filled completely with the cd-changer.  Each oil change is over $300 (no options for less) and all they do is ""inspect"" the car and change the oil!  The retractable roof worked perfectly every time and the neck scarf heater is the best feature of the car."
car_4546,"Love it, Love it!","Delighted with my Mercedes SLK 280, in Mars Red.  I fell in love first with the styling, then with the drive.  My favorite part is the air scarf and heated seats, that let you drive with the top down in cool weather (which in Texas is just about year round). The hardtop is leaps above having a rag top and works very well (and impresses anyone who sees it).  I actually like the factory nav system, and it has worked well for me. I find the car very comfortable on road trips, and got about 32mpg on the highway with premium gas.  My car has the DVD-based sound system - 4 GB of MP3's is a lot."
car_4547,Blast to Drive,I got tired of all the idiot lights coming on my BMW and bought one of these. I have had it 1 1/2 years and not a problem anywhere/anytime. Great acceleration and moves when you want it to in SF traffic. Car always gets looks and build/quality is excellent. You wont find cheap plastic or trim falling apart in this car. Also what I like best is the seat belt dosent rub no the leather (wear it out) BMW has this problem. Great handling car and 280 is enough power.
car_4548,Fun car to drive,"I was looking for a fun convertible car to drive, more interested in a good ride, but also some ponys under the hood to get 'er going. I found nirvana in the SLK!  I test drove several others - Z4's, Boxsters but didn't like the ragtops."
car_4549,Best Benz I've Ever Owned,"This is my 5th Mercedes, dating back to 1987.  It's my first roadster, after enduring a 2003 CLK (awful) and a 2005 CLK (vastly improved).  Fortunately, this car is wonderful.  The finish, the interior trim level, the seats, the workings of the convertible hard-top, the little touches like ""air-scarf"" and the other details all combine to make this car a joy to drive and a pleasure to own.  It's, by far, the best built Benz I've owned since, probably, the S class I had back in '89.  After a year and 10,000 miles so far so good with the exception of the navigation system (see below)!"
car_4550,Superb Automobile,I did the research on the sports cars. I test drove this car and loved it. Superior in many ways to competition. A bargain for the horsepower and design. This car turns heads. I love it.
car_4551,MB surprise,"Always wanted an MB and I am very happy so far that I bought this beauty. In fact when it went in for the 1000-3000 mile courtesy inspection,they left me a E-350 to drive for the day. It is actually not as comfortable as the SLK which wraps around you like a comforter. Even though I'm over 65 with a questionable back, this offers me more back support than the E-350. It's a head turner especially while wearing sun glasses so you can see the heads turn,but they can't see you. It's fast, very stable,fun to drive and engineered with almost nothing to add. The steering and brakes are very responsive. Handling around sharp curves is actually fun. It hugs the road without rear end slide. Love it."
car_4552,Too many +'s not to buy over Boxster,"I traded in an 06 Audi A-4 Convert, 1.8T. I hated the turbo and paying prem fuel for 170 hp. My previous car was a '99 Boxster and I loved it, but it became a maint nightmare ($3200in 4 mons.) I was on verge of buying a new Boxster and decided to test-drive the SK (I had already driven Z-4, 350zx, S2000, TT, etc).  I got a great deal ($6k off msrp) on SLK & 100% sure of decision.  Boxster has great style but doesnt't have 7 spd automatic, hardtop convert, heated 'scarf', etc."
car_4553,My dream car,I have dreamed about owning an SLK since the first time I saw one.  I have not been disappointed.  The car drives very well.  It is glued to the road but the ride is not harsh at all.  My car is the 350 6 cylinder which supplies plenty of power but still gets pretty good gas mileage.  The brakes are awesome.  The top mechanism performs flawlessly.  The fit and finish were first rate.  The only problem that have had was that the display for the radio/cd player stopped working.  The dealer fixed the problem during the routine 1000-3000 mile checkup.
car_4554,Don't buy one!,"This car is smoke and mirrors. It's slow, uncomfortable, gets poor gas mileage and is over priced.  Paid 45K for a auto and have to tolerate 17 dummy phone switches because the car does not have bluetooth?  Honestly, research BMW, Saab, Audi before buying this make.  I'd return the car tomorrow if I could.  Everyday I walk to this vehicle and wonder why I paid so much for a car with so little?  Mercedes Benz must be making about 20 grand profit on each of these ""very, very average"" cars."
car_4555,Love it !,"Went to the dealership with intentions of buying another SUV. Drove the SLK280 and fell in love instantly. We like everything about it. 0 to 60 very quickly. Handles very well. Car travels very well and is quite comfortable. Gets over 28 MPG. The warm air scarf on a cool evening ride is great.Be sure to use the wind skirt with the top down and your hair will look like you just combed it, even after a long ride. Good sound system for tunes. Top goes up/down easy and fast. Because the car is so much fun to drive we wanted to take it on our trips to the beach but there is not very much cargo space, so we have decided to UPS our luggage."
car_4556,Love at first drive,My only regret is that we didn't buy one last year. Having been lucky enough to drive sports cars of up to 4 or 5 times the price I can say it holds its own. My main complaint is that the little indent on the center console isn't quite big enough to comfortably hold a pair of sunglasses.
car_4557,Great Change,"A couple of months ago I purchased an SLK280. I traded in my old 2002 SLK32. I love my old car but I like the new body style and the new changes in the 2005 models. The car runs and handles great, there is a loss in power between the 2 cars about 120 horses but the new 7 speed trans. makes for some of the loss and is more fun to drive, the interior seen bigger with more legg room. Everything in the car is great, no problems up to now, the sound system with the satellite option is worth it. There is a safety problem. The hatch to open the engine compartment is located next to your left foot, A couple times getting in and out from the car I opened by mistake with my foot."
car_4558,Pleasantly surprised,"I had no intention of buying this car initially, even during my test drive. But after a few weeks of ownership, we love this car.  When compared to Porsche Boxter, SLK is more refined and I simply love the styling and we get so many compliments. The sporty red seats and its contrast to silver body is really stunning. For the money, you get a sporty refined ride, build quality is excellent- especially the hardtop-you can open hardtop with the remote key. Handling isn't great at first, but that's mostly due to stiff steering wheel at first,  but it has loosened up.  Now the handling is great and acceleration is surprisingly quick.  I love the low grunt of exhaust sound.  It's really sporty"
car_4559,Balance of Comfort and Performance,"I drive this car 80mi a day in commuting to work on a mix of highway and back roads. It is the perfect balance between comfort and performance. It is a total joy to drive. I live in New England so threw on a set of snows, and even though it is rear wheel drive, with the traction control it handles quite well in the snow. I have put 10,000 mi. on it in 7 months and it has been flawless and I am a detail fanatic. People are always complimenting me on the looks. Just for the fun of it I may consider moving up to the 350 or AMG when I come off this lease."
car_4560,It works for me!,"This is my second SLK and I like this model much better. The styling and handling are far superior. I enjoy the improved ride, satellite radio and other new features. I am debating if in my next purchase if I want to to move up to the top of the line in two seaters  It is so much money in comparison to the alterantives.  I cannot justify a company lease either this would have to b a cash purchase/lease. I'm not sure if the next model is worth it.  But I love my SLK."
car_4561,Horrible quality - always being repaired,"I purchases a new SLK 350 and started having problems with it within the first 3000 miles. The oil sensor was faulty and then after being in the shop 8 days I got the car back and the  sensor receiver went bad.  then electronics module went bad twice, crank shaft sensor went bad, Car stopped because of electrical bug and had to be towed. Steering wheel spring sensor went bad. Navigation system had to be replaced.  Don't buy this car as the reliability is horrible. This car is constantly in for service."
car_4562,Sport and Luxury!,"Love this car! I commute 150 miles daily so fun and comfort is key. I wanted a sports car but with a smooth ride,  manual transmission AND a luxurious interior. That combo is hard to find. But it's all in this car and more. It's very quick but has a creamy ride (makes my old Z4 feel like a tin can)and the shifting is very smooth. The airscarf is awesome. The HK stereo incredible. Love the nav, but I wonder if the DVD is outdated, it doesn't list some very popular restaurants in our area? The car (mine's black) is stunning with the top down. All this and I feel very safe in it too."
car_4563,Awesome,"I loved it the day I got it and still do today. The SLK is a slick car that handles excellent and is so much fun to drive. It is small inside and there isn't much room for anything but the bare essentials, but the trunk space is marginally larger than in the past. Lots of fun, everyone checks it out and if you're in a hurry you can put your foot into it and the car will fly. The traction control is very responsive and impressive, but the front end does not stick to the road when cornering at very high speeds."
car_4564,I love this car!,"I bought it in August and it already has 6000 miles. 4500 miles are highway, and I can tell you this baby is a rocket on the road,  especially if add the AMG package. No problems so far! I would totally buy this car again."
car_4565,AMG Sport Package,"So I test drove both base model 280 and 350, and 350 with AMG sports pkg. The $4,000 option is well worth it for the looks and the improved handling of the car. It makes the SLK go from a luxury touring convertible to a real hard core sports car. Cornering ability with the lowered and stiffer suspension makes this a true competitor to Porsche Boxter/S. This car wins on styling, I get envious looks from not only Boxster owner, but 911 owners as well, I suppose a fully loaded SLK is pretty close to the price range of the 911. But you get the fun hardtop convertible."
car_4566,Performance,"One deficiency is inability to add or replace the single CD with a CD changer although it is listed as an available option for about $400. Regrettably I did not learn of this until I had driven about 300 miles. To change from SLK 280 to SLK 350, which had one, dealer wanted $10,000, instead of the $4,000 difference of MLP of $4,000, for models, since my SLK 280 was a used car.  Beware and be careful."
car_4567,Should be sent to the scrap pile,"The car is obviously poorly engineered. I can only say that this is the worst underperforming car you could waste money on. Save your cash and buy a real exotic 'cause this ain't it. 36K and the transmission had to be replaced. The engine knocks like an AMC Pacer on unleaded gas. Burns oil like the forgot to install the rings. I will never own another MB after this beast is put to pasture. Oh, MB has denied that they are replacing 350 engines like there is no tomorrow. So much for Dr. Z and his nonsense. He should make the remaining payments. The car is listed at 268 HP; no way it develops 268, more like 200, maybe. My Z4 could blow the paint of this beer can."
car_4568,SLK350 Hugs the Road and is Fast!,"The car is fast and hugs the road.  I drove for 2000 miles in Europe during my European Delivery.  On the hundreds of hairpin turns in the Dolomites, I couldn't even get the Stability Control to kick in, much less have the car break loose from the road.  Other than the paint having some OrangePeel ( I notice that, no one else seems to ), I don't have any quality issues to complain about.  Everything works as it should."
car_4569,Great car for the money,I bought this 1997 SL500 with the optional panorama roof for a great price and since that I have driven it a whopping 5000 miles and had absolutely no issues. I love the way this car drives (I only drive it in the summer) the handling is superb and it has a lot of power yet it is definitely a car I can and will take on a longer road trip. If you can find a car in good shape I can only recommend it prices will never be lower than they are now. Just make sure you stay away from older models (90-96) as well as the SL600 unless you have a lot of extra cash.
car_4570,19 yrs and going strong,"Purchased this Maroon SL 320 in Colorado and drove it to Spokane, WA immediately at 80 MPH I managed 25.7 MPG, I was quite surprised. At 102,000 miles it has a few issues and they will be more expensive to repair but the wife and I shop around for missing items and repair parts. We have not taken the hardtop off yet, hoping to do so before it gets cold so far it is a lot of fun to drive."
car_4571,Love my buggy,"This is my 1st SL and I am having fun,  Purchased it to be a weekend toy but find myself driving it more and more.  i have had no maintenance issues and she is 19 years old.....finger crossed.  Everything is expensive on this car so when it breaks I am mentally prepared to deal with that.  All in all...just a great and fun car!"
car_4572,what would you expect,"We all know the mystique behind the name Mercedes and its the same mystique that porsche and bmw and now the audi's have.  Engine power and design and the blue print of a car that is/was ahead of its time.  My SL is what it was when it was 100,000 of the showroom floor, an engineering marvel.  Just as the porsche's I have owned. If you spent $100,000 on an American made car in the mid 90's the only ones that would be worth a damn today would be the ones never or rarely driven. German or Japanese and you cannot go wrong.  Stay away from the audis however, they havent figured out the turbo debacle yet"
car_4573,1997 SL500 SL1 SPORT,This car is for a free spirit. Handles most superb. Never out of extreme power in any circumstance. Gets down and races anyone. An engineering feat. Most amazing car I've ever owned.
car_4574,"1997 Mercedes SL500 with 38,000 miles on","This car is solidly built, handles extremely well, and is a pleasure to drive. The design is one of understated elegance. Mine has very low mileage for its age and all original paint with no mechanical problems. These are a bargain if you get one without issues as new they cost $89,000 w/o options. The r129 type from the pre-Chrysler era is desirable. The mileage is what one ought to expect from a two ton car driven with a big V-8; if you are having this much fun is has to cost a little money! Skip the non-factory wheels as they really do nothing for day-to-day performance."
car_4575,A True German Classic  Roadster...,"I came across my SL320 after the hurricanes took out my Mercedes ML with a 32 yr old oak tree. I can't say enough good things about this car. The car demands attention, a true head turner. I usually only put about 5k miles per year as a leisure car. This car is a blast, I leave my BMW at home and have racked on the miles-12k. I haved the hardtop stored, and the storage compartments behind the seats accomidate my briefcase. The best feeling to crank the A/C to 60 and drop the top, turn up the Bose system and let my cares fly off with the wind in my hair. Handling is surperb. Power is very impressive, and am thankful I got the 320 over the 500 and 600-with gas at 3bucks+, & lower insurance"
car_4576,Awesome car!,"I've driven several of these cars and just bought one.  They are extremely powerful and smooth driving.  I also drove the Lexus SC400 and SC430, the Porsche Boxter and 911 and several others.  They're all fun, but for my money the SL500 is tops.  Driving with the convertible top down and the Bose stereo up is quite an experience.  Try it!"
car_4577,Dream with a smile,"For the past 30 years I've always wanted a Mercedes SL and finally after all the years of the desire, I have no disappointments. It's truly a dream car. I chose the 320 to not have to spend so much time at the gas pumps, but it still burns more than I expected. That might be due to the fact that I can't seem to slow it down. I really love this vehicle!"
car_4578,"Smooth Power, Value and Quality","Hello all: I have found it to be a fast and subtle commuter/touring machine. I traded over to it from a 97 993 (which was a great car) as my wife was adverse to the Porsche ride (a very good ride in my opinion). This is my second SL and my 3rd Mercedes. As all SL’s it is quietly fast and comfortable. The handling is greatly improved from models of the late 70’s and the dealer service has been equal to that of Porsche (excellent). As with the 993, I would recommend a dealer extended warranty as these cars can disrupt your budget if something major malfunctions after the original one expires. My wife is found of the panoramic roof in the rain and enjoys the heated seat."
car_4579,Love It,"This is my second Mercedes but first 
SL.  I purposefully purchased the 320 
over the 500 and consider I made an 
excellent choice.  This car has 
performed far above expectations."
car_4580,The perfect automobile,"This is my second SL 500 and, like the 
first one, it has performed 
flawlessly.  There is nothing like the 
solid feel of a Benz, and the 
convertible is the epitome of the MB 
design."
car_4581,"Nice, but should've bought a 911 Turbo","The car is great, except that I really 
wish the car had 6sp manual 
transmission. The auto tranny doesn't 
do the engine justice at all. The car 
runs surprisingly slow compared with 
all the 'hype' I had read. I guess my 
expectations were too high."
car_4582,SL55 AMG,"This car is a dream to drive its 
performance is unmatched in its class. 
It does a faster 0-60 than the ferrari 
modeno and spyder. This car exudes 
class and power if you have the funds i 
deffinetly advise picking one up"
car_4583,Perfect Fun,"This is raw power, neatly packaged in a 
fun, classy vehicle. The silver and ash 
combination  creates a bright, classic 
look great for the summer heat. But 
under this attractive skin is pure 
power. I don't believe I've come close 
to unleashing the complete power of the 
vehicle. Acceleration, handling 
passing, etc. are as good as it gets."
car_4584,stupid blue lights,"nice car BUT if the top is down in the 
daytime the baby blue lights disappear 
from the dash board and all vital info 
is lost. The GPS is a throw alway, 
absolutly worthless. The top has come 
apart with only 30 uses and the trim is 
absolutly from K mart. 
I have owned many MB's and if they only 
spent a little more attention to 
details and got that cheap plastic out 
of the interior and exterior maybe 
sl500 can make a come back. Just not 
the car that it used to be and I still 
had to spend $1.00 to get one of those 
little mirrors to eliminate the blind 
spot."
car_4585,persoanl experience,"a fantastic 2nd car. fun to drive, but
trunk to samll for two golf bags."
car_4586,Wickedly powerful,"This car replaced my already superb clk 
55 and it shares the garage space with 
my Boxster S.  It is unbelievebly fast 
and handles even better than the 
incredible Boxster.  There are no words 
to describe this car it has to be 
driven.
My car is black with red interior and 
AMG multi-spoke (turbine wheels).  It 
has all the options and it is really a 
dream car!"
car_4587,ok,"i love it. it has the best driving 
abiliy in the world. this is my 
favorite of all of my cars"
car_4588,fun car,"Excellent handling with lots of power.
Navigation system to complicated
especially for my wife. So far the car
has been problem free"
car_4589,Mercedes Best Car,"It is not noisey, it drives very smooth 
with sports override if you want, great 
brakes and easy to put top down. 
Mercedes has honored their commitment 
to send someone out if you have a 
problem.  I had a flat and someone came 
within 20 minutes.  Best car I have 
ever owned from Mercedes."
car_4590,SL500 - Good and Bad,"The SL500 is my dream car...and also my 
nightmare.  The car looks and drives 
awesome.  But I have had it 3 weeks and 
it has been in the shop 3 times because 
the front xenon headlight continues to 
stop working...which makes it's 
dangerous for night driving.  The 
service dept. has yet to figure out a 
solution.  But like a Jaguar, it looks 
great SITTING in the garage!"

ever hapened to me"
car_4592,500SL,A GREAT CAR REALLY TURNS HEADS!!!
car_4593,SL500-The Best,"I have had excellent experience with 
the car. It's styling and design is the 
best there is. It has plenty of power 
and the use of the top is easy. The 
computer controls take some time 
getting used to and the navigation is 
not easy to use. It's fuel economy is 
what I expected, but is not great. 
Technolically, it has everything."
car_4594,foul smell in mercedes,"my car has been in shop for over 120 
daysin one year.now there foul smell 
from a defect in the door design in the 
designo version. it supposidly leaked 
glue and caused a foul smell.we heard 
of other cars with same 
problem.mercedes has to date not told 
the exact nature of the problem or the 
chemical that leaked.my car still stinks"
car_4595,Center of Attraction,"Definitely a better car than previous 
SL 500 models"
car_4596,My new car,"This is the most amazing car I have 
ever owned!"
car_4597,Great ride,"This car has been fun.  Great on the 
road.  Integrated phone and voice 
commands make you wonder how you lived 
without them.  The convertible is 
extremely quiet, you can have a 
discussion at a whisper at highway 
speeds with the hardtop down.  Small 
problems and Mercedes less than 
perfect service are the major 
shortcoming."

driving in all kinds of weather - snow, 
ice, sun, I find the car performs in an 
outstanding manner. The car's brake by 
wire is great. Also, all traction 
features make car fun to drive. Total 
reliability in first 14 months is 
outstanding!"
car_4600,Best value of any exotic,"Nothing but fun to drive and own, and 
best of all,looks like free to own 
also with resale values still bringing 
premiums."
car_4601,My SL500,"This is my fifth benz since 1988. I 
have owned the e class, sl class and 
the s class.  this new sl is by far the 
best car i have ever owned.  the 
handling and driving experience is 
unbelievable.  I would reccommend that 
anyone who wants this car.....to get it.
There is nothing that needs improvement."
car_4602,Best car ever built,Best Mercedes ever built
car_4603,none better,"After owning 9 new Mercedes, in 18
years, I finally bought my first SL. 
Sell you rfirst born male child if you
have to, because driving doesn't get any
better than this."

SL500...small to big,... fast to 
sluggish,.. I've owned them all. The 
absolute,overall favorite is the SL 
500. Fast, sexy, comfortable, nimble, 
logical, fun, uncommon, and  nearly as 
beautiful as the perfect woman. Curves 
in the right places, predictable 
attitude, a dream to be with, enviable 
from every angle, fast and precise with 
a full throttle voice to die for. A 
perfect specimen, especially when 
topless. Soft in the right places and 
graciously endowed with the right 
equipment. Push the right buttons and 
get ready for the ride of your life."
car_4607,Great Update to the classic,"I never expected to get another 
convertible - the hardtop won me over.  
The styling is almost universally 
praised.  The engineering is most 
impressive - stability control, brakes, 
feel of the steering.  But all in all, 
it is a beautifully styled and 
outfitted transport device for the new 
century.  The downside is the 
overcharge for options - esp. phone.  
By why question the cost of a piece of 
art?"
car_4608,incredible,"just incredible, handles great, quiet 
and fast. edmons says its too hevey, 
but i like the feel of a hevey car.  
it feels safe."
car_4609,"Fast, Gorgeous & Fun","Truely the most fun to drive.  I have 
fun every time I drive it. I saw a 
recent review that said that the arm 
rest was too hard and in another that 
the truck was too small.  Get a life! 
I've looked at all the coupes out 
there.  This one will travel with two 
sets of golf clubs and the top down. 
This car leaves all of them in the dust 
and is great to look at standing still 
or on the move."
car_4610,The Car,"Has Premium performance just enough to 
get you out of there."
car_4611,Mercedes Baby !,"I have moved up over the years fron a C 
Class to an E Class and now the real 
deal. Every purchase has been great but 
I have finally met my baby.

Every other car in this class is just a 
copy. (especially the Lexus, which is 
the biggest knock-off ever)"
car_4612,The SL55 Rocks!,"This car is truly awesome!  The 
combination of power and luxury is 
unmatched by anything else on the road. 
I sold my Lexus LS400, Honda S2000 and 
Mercedes SLK32.  Don't need them 
anymore!"
car_4613,More than just a pretty face,"I was drawn to this car by its looks 
but am more impressed by its 
performance. For me it strikes the 
perfect balance between a sports car 
and a luxury car. I use to think BMW 
was the ultimate driving machine. I do 
not think that any longer"
car_4614,500 Sl,This car is simply wonderful.
car_4615,Hot stuff,"i really like this car a lot.It runs 
very well and it has great features."
car_4616,fabulous automobile,"this is my fourth SL. This one doesn't 
ride as soft, however, the handling is 
unbelievable for the weight. The top 
action is to die for and it's great to 
be able to recline the seats. I have 
made only one road trip but the seats 
are fabulous. It was worth the ten 
grand over MSRP to not wait one or two 
years."
car_4617,Simply the best,"My 5th SL in 15 years and by far the 
best. An awesome car with technology 
that others will take years to catch up 
to. Braking power is incredible, the 
ABC feature is the best automotive 
invention since disks breaks (I 
experienced it first in my S55). I have 
a Ferrari 360 and Aston DB7 who, in my 
opinion, are vastly inferior in 
technology, safety, road holding and 
braking. No contest, besides, when the 
SL55 comes out they are toast anyway. 
Great looks and while not a real 
exotic, it is the first exotic SL 
coming out of Stuttgart. A marvel."
car_4618,Outstanding !,"This is an outstanding vehicle to 
drive. The security of a coupe with the 
ability to become a convertable at the 
push of a button.  I have the Sport 
package, which in my opion, makes for 
an incredibly attractive looking car.  
On a 1400 mile trip I averaged 24 mpg, 
with a speed average of 70 mph. This 
included all stops.  I think that is 
very good fuel ecomony."
car_4619,Best MB,"I traded my CLK55 and my wife's SLK320 
for the SL500 - it's the best of both 
worlds.  Great fun on the curves, 
acceptable power and lots of comfort.  
Its the best of the 5 MB's I've owned."
car_4620,The Best,Best Car in the Market
car_4621,This is a fantastic car!,"I decided to change my old Mercedes 
320 CE this year. I was hesitating 
between Jaguar XJK coupe and 
Mercedes SL 500 but I have bought 
the last one finally. Now I am happy 
to have this car. It's a dream, I have 
fantastic feelings of pleasure"
car_4622,Still the best convertible!,"I Love my new SL500, I will keep it for 
a long time.  It retains the classic 
interior looks of the SL's I've loved 
for so long.  I love everything about 
this car, but then again I'm a Mercedes 
freak."
car_4623,best car in the world,"The car is everything you would want in 
one! Buy IT!!! If you have money!"
car_4624,She's a Keeper,"This car car has it all!!!  Great 
looks, comfort, performance, safety 
and quality.  I compared the SL500 to 
the Lexus SC430, Porsche Carrera 4 and 
the Jaguar XKR.  This beats them all.  
It looks sporty, classy, sexy and 
tough.  It fits any mood the driver 
has."
car_4625,mercades,"the car is great it is fun to drive and 
very exciting"
car_4626,Ultimate Roadster of 2002,all around spectacular look and performance feel. A real head turner and will continue to be for more years to come
car_4627,Awesome,"If you are looking for a car to turn heads (especially females) and you have the means, look no further.

This is in my opinion the most beautiful new car on the market now or in the last 10 years."
car_4628,about my experience,"this vehicle is a thunder for curbes.
this vehicle is safe when comes to brake question.
this vehicle is otherwise a fast,quality,safe,reliable,but 
the interior is getting lame...
its out of style
and needs something new...to beat other concurents"
car_4629,"Unique, Sporty Luxury","I've put 6,000 miles on this car since I bought it 6 months ago. Now at 76,000 miles. The SL55 has been a reliable daily driver even though I've driven it very hard, including a track day. It is not as comfy as my previous 4-passenger E class, but is one heck of a lot quicker. While not a sports car due to its weight, the 55 handles well and is deceptively fast. Turn off the stability control and the car is very entertaining on a twisty road. Just don't try that on wet pavement. With the hard top up, it feels as solid as a real coupe. Top down, it's a true convertible with very little wind blast in the cabin. I bought a full aftermarket warranty to manage repair costs, but haven't had occasion to make a claim, yet."
car_4630,SL 600,expensive to repair electronics
car_4631,TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!!,"I purchased a pre-owned SL600 in spring 2013, and problems occurred almost immediately after leaving the lot.  Dash displayed a TPMS issue, so I brought it back to find out that sensors for this were never installed but I could add them for $200 per tire.  Less than 3 mo/3,000 miles later a hydraulic suspension hose burst lowering the car to the ground, and replacement for this was nearly $3,000.  Even after repair the mechanics were not able to clear the suspension error in the system.Jump ahead another couple of months and I am roadside again, with a tire blowout due to an improperly mended cracked wheel. The Dealer was kind enough to cover replacement of this however.  The water pump also failed shortly thereafter.Over the next couple of years of ownership, I racked up quite a service history.  Brake assist system failure and replacement, more suspension parts, interior and exterior door handles, folding roof mechanism, wheel bearings, battery, differential replacement, several other issues, and regular but expensive maintenance.  Repairs and service exceeded 70% of the original purchase price (which was not cheap) and the warranty barely covered half of this.With a total of 35 days in the shop and 5 roadside breakdowns over 3 years I did get pretty familiar with the new models and the loaner program, which was nice.  But for the price I had to pay to keep this car drivable I could have hired a car service.  Operating cost was over $2.50/mile for less than 17,000 miles, not including gas, tires and other consumables.The car was a humiliating laughing stock at the office, and I actually feared driving it not only for my own safety but anticipating the next catastrophic repair.  When I returned the car it was explained to me that it still needed at least $5,000 of work, but I had enough.  The way I see it, either the dealer was aware of the many issues with this car and didn’t disclose them, or did not thoroughly inspect and sort them out before purchase (maybe both).  Neither explanation is acceptable. I will never again purchase a Mercedes-Benz product."
car_4632,Love this car,Driving it in city traffic is like having a domestic house cat sitting on you lap purring.Drop the hammer on the open roadand it transforms into a Bengal Tiger.
car_4633,This would be the best car if it was more reliable,"I bought this 4 years old from mercedes dealer in reno.The car looks turn heads EVERYWHERE, Such a pleasure to drive, the 7 speed tranny shifts so smooth that its hard to tell how fast u are going because the power band is so smooth.The suspension creates such a smooth ride that you will notice how different it is then other cars.This has been my absolute fav car to drive, but what a nightmare to own.Battery in the trunk went and cost 300$ for new.you have to go to the dealer for everything because they need to reset the computer or else the car will constantly shut off as a gimmick to get you to the dealer.also suspension valve went and cost $3000 to fix, very common problem"
car_4634,Six years makes no difference,"I've always wanted a supercar, a 2-seater and a convertible.  We got all three and got it in this car. I've always enjoyed driving, have favored Mercedes over other brands once I started buying them.  I had Audi and BMW top line cars in the past and the final kicker than makes the Benz best for me (besides being able to handle my 1.97 m height)is superior quality and service.  The M-B people have always taken exceptional care of my cars and I am a fussy one.  Buying a 2004 model, the only real limitation I did not pay enough attention to was the dated transmission, it does not shift responsively enough with that motor and especially with the steering wheel buttons/early paddle shifters."
car_4635,Premium Price -Poor Quality?,"Beautiful car that gets a lot of looks. Fit and finish are right on par with what you would expect from a Mercedes. We have had many problems with the quality of this car: Broken interior panels, faulty anti-lock relay, faulty anti-lock brake pump, broken baffles inside gas tank (had to replace gas tank!). Now the ignition system has just failed. 53,250 miles, and many rented loaners. We are glad to have bought the extended warranty."
car_4636,Dream Car,The best combination of any car ever built. It's a sports car (use only the manual transmission and the steering wheel metal gear changers); it's a luxury car with a sports car or luxury car suspension; it can cruise mildly or attack corners; it's beautiful (silver ties whole car together); it's a hardtop for foul weather and winter and a convertible - incredible. There may be better cars for any one item but none with this combination at such a high level.
car_4637,The Ultimate Car,"This car has it all; performance of a supercar, beautiful in and out, luxury, hardtop and convertible.  Drive it only in Manual Mode and the suspension and transmission rivals race cars yet it is so full of luxury and a convertible of hard top for winter or foul weather."
car_4638,Extremely Happy,"I purchased the SL500 from the original with 35k miles. I had a 1998 911 Porsche which I regret selling until I purchased this 2004 SL500. Reasons why: the hard top, the comfort, the sound system, and the look! I would not buy a new one, because of the minor changes, plus the money that I save. It's A great car to buy used because they are very reliable and lots of fun to drive. If you do buy an SL500 get an extended warranty because they become costly as they grow old!"
car_4639,Poser,"Least reliable vehicle I have ever experienced. Needs frequent, unscheduled visits to repair shop. A car's first priority should be quality and reliability.  This car fails in that regard.  500 hp is irrelevant if the car is sitting once again in the dealer's repair shop."
car_4640,Leg room,"The car handles well, I gave up a 650i I am 6,5"" and had a lot more leg room than the SL gives. More color choice and wish the seat would go back even more. Overall love the car"
car_4641,It should Fly,"I have owned Ferrari, other AMG Mercedes, several SL500's, Corvette's, and I would divorce my wife before giving up this car for any reason. I can't wait to go to work in the morning to drive down the winding grade I live on top of, and going up is just as exhilarating. This is the best car I have ever owned. I also own the S550 and never drive it....why would I?"
car_4642,New to the fold,Great car. My first Mercedes and my first convertible. Great torque and handling. A real eye catcher. Have only had it for 2 weeks and have had multiple comments on its good looks.
car_4643,All About The Experience,"I bought the car new and have driven in all types of conditions. It is the most amazing car I have owned and I have owned a lot! It is a sports car, racing car, convertable (Of course), city car, road car, sedate car or beast depending on what you ask it to do. It is stealty because its little brother the Sl500 or SL 550 is common and other drivers assume that is what you are driving until you turn on the speed. What a surprise in their eyes through your rear view mirror! This car is a total experience - fun. Only caution is ""it eats tires."" If you want performance expect to change them every 5,000 miles or so. Performance not important, why did you buy this car?! I want a Ferrari599F1 next"
car_4644,Worth the splurge,"Great car.  Great finishes.  This car will certainly grab the attention of others, especially if it's the V12."
car_4645,Best Car I've Ever Owned,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this car.  Have owned 3 BMWs and Alfa Romeo Spider, the last year in the US and on and on and there is nothing like the head turning luxury and performance that you find in this automobile.  I am amazed every time some kid pulls up next to me on the highway in some souped up car at how much guts this car has on the open road. Sounds good, and I've literally gotten standing ovations when the top goes down in all its glory!"
car_4646,My Sweet Silver SL500,"It's luxury, comfort and fun all in one car.  It's a head turner and I get this all the time ""nice car!"""
car_4647,Loving my '05 SL600,"i have not yet put on 1000mi., but this is simply the most wonderful car I have ever driven.  This car is an ""iron fist in a velvet glove"". It is smooth, silky, solid, and fast to drive. This black beauty is beautiful to behold,  top up or down. This happens very quickly. The seats are comfortable, yet firm.  Whether it's a trip to the store, or a cruise up north for a 100 miles, I can't wait to drive it."
car_4648,It's worth the love/hate aggravation,"I absolutely love this car!  Many times in the past year, I've hated it, too.  I've had numerous dealer visits ranging from minor adjustments all the way up to replaced superchargers.  My dealer always takes care of me!   It's way over-engineered, but again that's what I thrive on as well.  There's something great about driving literally the fastest, best handling car on the road, and then there's that level of AMG exclusivity too...I attended the Ultimate AMG Challenge Fall '04 in Germany and was fortunate to meet the one technician who assembled my car's engine."
car_4649,Sophisticated Supercar,"Unbeatable combination of luxury, performance and practicality.  Beautiful but does not attract unwanted attention. Comfortable,quiet and smooth, totally reliable (so far). Easy access to local dealer service (nearest Ferrari, Aston, or Bentley dealer is 100 miles away).  Was considering Porsche Turbo but dealer wanted me to make an appointment to drive owner's used turbo, rather than the new one I wanted on the lot."
car_4650,2004 Mercedes-Benz SL500 - UNRELIABLE,"Well, here we go. I bought my SL500 in
March of '04 and immediately the top
failed. It was recalled for brakes in
June. Its transmission failed and had to be
replaced in October. Rains came in
November and the trunk/top leaked. The
dealer assured me that this was an
""isolated"" incident. Unfortunately it
happened to me. They had to replace the trunk
hinges. I have never owned a car that had
trunk hinges fail, have you? Also, its brakes are
really wierd, no feel. I thought I was
buying Germany's best, but alas I
bought a Plymouth with a three pointed
star on the hood. What a shame. That
star use to mean something."
car_4651,the best,This is my 8th Mercedes and by far the most fun to drive.  Not bad looking either!
car_4652,Top of its class!,"After having owned 2 XKR's, I can say
that the SL-class is a worthy adversary.
 Beauty (and brains) power this Mercedes
machine!  High-tech everything!  VERY
Comftorable! Fast! Fast! Fast!"
car_4653,The best car on the market,"i have owned so many cars and this car 
is by far the best car i have ever 
owned.  awesome to drive the hard top 
is great and the confort is 
unbeleivable."
car_4654,Mercedes SL5oo,"Great fun, incredible pickup, 
beautiful lines.  A dream of a car."
car_4655,J.C.'s SL,"An awesome machine. Had a 1998 SL500 and
loved it. Amazing that Mercedes could
improve on an almost perfect car."
car_4656,More fun than the day I got my license.,"Its the most exciting car I have ever 
driven. People frequently roll down 
their window at stop lights to ask me 
questions about the car. I'm always 
more interested in taking it out if the 
weather is good enough to put down the 
top. I haven't had this much driving 
fun since the week I first received my 
driver's license (and that was 41 years 
ago)."
car_4657,Wunderbar,"Traded a 2003 430 CLK. Loved it but 500 
SL is tops"
car_4658,The Rocketship,"The AMG package makes this Benz a 
rocket.  It is quiet and handles like a 
dream.  This Benz is the best of the 
four that I have owned.  Some quibble 
about limited trunk space.  Name me a 
rocketship that does have a spacious 
trunk."
car_4659,It's so much fun,"Buying this car 16 year old car has been a joy.  It turns heads, drives like a dream, corners likes its on rails, and the speed -- well it's breathtaking.  Went out early one morning to the turnpike with the top down and my wife reading emails in the passenger seat.  Got it to 105 and she didn't notice.  Just a little stretch of the legs for this rocket.   I'm 6' 4"" and it's one the of few cars in which I'm really comfortable.  Maintenance is expected and keeps her running great."
car_4660,Amazing Vehicle,"I love my Mercedes, the fact that you can go from hard top to soft top in a few easy minutes. There is room for a couple of bags in the back ""seat"", unlike other sports cars where you don't even have room for a purse. The ride is like sitting home in your livingroom. The gas mileage on mine is 30-32 mpg on a trip. It's an all around beautiful car. I am not an engineer, but I see no improving on perfection here. I have driven them all, I wanted to before I made an educated purchase and this was the only one standing at the end of the tests, all things considered, gas mileage, comfort, style, class."
car_4661,Amazing,"Amazing car all around...perfect mix of performance, comfort, convenience and luxury. Drives like no other car, with endless smooth V12 power on tap right under your right foot. Truly an amazing thoroughbred."
car_4662,Someday is Now!,"I have admired the Mercedes Roadster 
since it was a 190SL.  Finally decided 
this was the time. I am not a sportscar 
person. This car is a luxury car that 
happens to look sporty. Perfect! Plenty 
of power to spare and love the handling 
on corners. Mercedes service has been 
great!"
car_4663,LUXURY 2-SEATER: Convertible limousine,"German solid engineering at its best.  
This model superseeded in 1990 the 
classic 106, which only lacked the 
power top.  
My car is 'Sport' version, It seems 
bulky, in spite of its modest 
dimensions.  It is more of a luxury 
convertible 2 seater limousine then a 
nimble sports car.
Seats are better then most American 
cars. Everything works with monotonous 
regularity - it is not an exciting car 
to drive, but to be seen in!"
car_4664,"""The ONE""","This is the car! this in my mind was 
the best car ever made by mercedez! 
its sporty, its luxury and well its 
gorgeous! the car drives great! the 
suspention is perfectly regulated for 
higway driving and city traffic!"
car_4665,GREAT,GREAt
car_4666,High Performance and High Costs,"I've had my 2004 SL55 AMG for about a month. Compared to the many sporty and luxury cars I've previously owned, the SL55 stands out as a remarkable combination of performance and luxury. The main limitation on the SL55 is its weight, which becomes apparent when you try to fling the car around like a Porsche; not possible. On the other hand, the ride quality and comfort are on par with the best Benz high-end models. If you buy one of these cars, get a warranty and be prepared to pay for the items no warranty will cover, like hoses, infotainment system and shock absorbers. The front ground clearance of the SL55 is very low. Remember to use the highest suspension level setting before entering a driveway or parking lot. Scraping a parking lot ""log"" can cause thousands of dollars in damage. (I found out the hard way.)"
car_4667,Sweet ride!,"Everything you want in a fun get away car! I thought I would use it for weekend jaunts through the countryside with the top down,  and I do,  however it turned or to be my daily driver.  I hate seeing the miles rack up so quickly but I can't keep from driving it everywhere!  It has without a doubt the most comfortable seats I've found. The handing is great in all situations and of course the awesome power never gets old. It never fails to turn heads no matter where I go."
car_4668,"$110,000 LEMON","New car stalled 4 times. After pulling over and waiting for a few minutes car would start up again. Took it every time to a dealer. No problem found.I hear grinding sound, Dealer says normal. never heard that in any of my 20 other cars I have bought before. Soon as warranty expired, there was a problem. During test Dealer claimed that the Compression cable broke. Cost $2000+. I still hear noise and (sometimes) gears shift at a very high RPM.Went to get Smog test. They said they could not get steady RPM of 2800 to perform the test.This week the door handle broke. Cost $500.I would say that MBZ has VERY POOR QUALITY.Buying MBZ 1984-2007. NEVER AGAIN."
car_4669,Great ride,I just bought this SL550 for my wife. What a beautiful car. She wanted a sports car and I would not let her drive my Z8 :-) This car is such a nice all around car. It had about 8K miles on it and is 2.5 years old and like another mentioned about 50% of initial MSRP. It was a certified MB so we got a additional 2 year 50K warranty on top of the existing warranty. The car is built like a tank and has plenty of power. It is no Z8 but a much better every day car and tourer and quite the luxury cruiser. We could have spent $60K on a new Corvette GS or the same on this TT&L and it was a no brainer.
car_4670,The Perfect Drop Top,"I have owned my SL 550 for about 18 months so I have driven it in all conditions.  I have to say it is absolutely the finest car I have ever owned.   When the top is up, it is as quiet as they come.  I often conduct handsfree conference calls in it and people think I am at the office it is so quiet.  When the top is down, oh man, it is awesome.  The car is plenty fast in the SL550 trim but if you need a rocket ship, go for the SL55 or 65. But be careful, learn how to drive a car with that kind of power!   The ride is smooth and acceleration is excellent.  I live in a big city where the interstates are competitive.  I have all the power I need in this car.  I would highly recommend it!"
car_4671,"SL550 The Fast, the beautiful and the so","Just finished a 2,000 mile trip in our newly acquired 07. We drove it from Illinois to Oklahoma City, a trip that had us passing over interstate highways at 75 MPH and rolling through the backroads in Oklahoma. This amazing beast transport the passengers with a feeling of swift, solid sure footedness and capability. The engine is ferocious- at 100 MOH it is barely breathing hard. At more down to earth levels of speed it gets over 27 MPG. That's right, we saw 27.8 MPG indicated and our math upon fillup confirmed the number. The seats are nothing short of nirvana in terms of features and adjustability. The Sat Nav works well and Sirius Radio is a wonder. The SL 550 is simply word class."
car_4672,More fun than allowed,"This is my second Benz. The sl is fun, fast and better mpg than the manufacturer states - if I don't feel the need to pass everyone on the road (hard to do!) I'm getting consistently 24+ on the highway. Don't hesitate. Get one."
car_4673,Trendsetter,"Excellent sports car with that extra bit of luxury that set this vehicle apart from and ahead of the competition.  I just love driving it, be it on the road going to and from work or at the race- track."
car_4674,sl550 saved my life,"I bought my 2007 sl550 with 3800 miles on nov 5 2009 on nov 6 2009 I was hit head on by an accelerating Jeep Cherokee that turned into my lane across a double yellow line, car was totaled but I walked away with some disc and whiplash injuries. There is no doubt this car saved my life, I traded a 2004 Corvette and a 2005 slk350 to get this sl550. If I was in any other car I would have been killed. There is no doubt this car saved my life, I am buying another one and will never buy any other car. Thank you Mercedes for your build quality and crash worthiness."
car_4675,Second SL55 AMG,"After driving an 06 SL55 AMG I traded my fully optioned and modified 04 CLK55 AMG for this fully optioned car with the 030 Performance Package. I had it less than a month when it was totaled on 12/31/08. I am so impressed by this car I bought an 07 SL55 AMG with the 030 and all options after the insurance claims were settled. For comparison I tested the 09 Shelby GT500KR, 09 Chev Corvette Z06, 07 BMW 650i convt, 08 BMW 550 Sport and an 08 SL550 Sport. I even considered an 08 CLK63 Black Series. Personally, I think the SLs are great cars that can do everything very well. Although it is not as nimble as my previous 03 BMW M5 and 02 M3 its still my 1st choice. It's stablemate is a great 05 E55."
car_4676,A Balance Between Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,"I never would have paid the MSRP for this car new, but as a 2 year old lease return with less than 15K for 50% of MSRP, it seemed reasonable.  The balance of performance and luxury/comfort is very impressive.  It's very comfortable as a luxo- cruiser, but only a short throttle stab away from a rear-end sliding beast.  I've had BMW's and S-version Audi's before, and this time I looked at used AM Vantage's (poor warranty) and M6's (sorry - just not very attractive), and considered 911's as well(yes, it's more of a sports car), but as a daily luxo driver in urban traffic that is still capable of lots of hard-top down, rip-snorting fun, this is a very tough car to beat....especially for 1/2 off!"
car_4677,A grown-up toy,"The power of 510 ponies cannot be beat when you're behind a truck, along side a slow poke, or just dying to feel the wind in your hair. Tons of truck space, all the bells, tolerable gas mileage, and fun, fun fun. Just wish people didn't park right next to me all the time!"
car_4678,The Jekel and Hyde of sports cars,Due to its active suspension (ABC) it can cruise like a S-class but it stiffens up for almost no lean in the fun twistees and corners-Amazing! The transmission senses when you need punch and adjusts to your driving style by the second-a great feature since your driving reactions can be so dynamic in today's crazy traffic. You can adjust the way the car handles from comfort to sport (including ride height) with a push of a button. The 7 speed auto- transmission can also be changed from comfort to sport for that all-out sports car performance. Great V8 engine- very smooth but has incredible low range torque and all the power you might want.
car_4679,Overall- great luxury sports/touring car,Overall a great luxury sports/touring car. Due to its active suspension (ABC) it can cruise like a S-class but it stiffens up for almost no lean in the fun twistees and corners-Amazing! The transmission senses when you need punch and adjusts to your driving style by the second-a great feature since your driving reactions can be so dynamic in today's crazy traffic. You can adjust the way the car handles from comfort to sport (including ride height) with a push of a button.
car_4680,Great Automobile,"I traded a '07 Corvette - fully loaded, it was a great American car, but no comparison to my new SL 550. Performance, handling, quality interior and exterior are beyond my expectations. I have had many MB automobiles since my first 1988, this is by far the best."
car_4681,Fun Fancy and Frivolous,"This is my third SL-class car I have owned in the past 3 years.  I would have never gotten an SL55 except for the large price mark-down from the sticker since this is a lease return. This car obviously has the most power (510 hp), and thus the first time I floored the pedal, I said ""WOW.""  This car does move.  The motorized hard top is definitely cool, and makes the car versatile. It is also luxurious inside. Finally this car is expensive. Thus fun, fancy and frivolous."
car_4682,Great car still has a few computer bugs,"My 2007 is a much better vehicle than my 2003SL. While the styling is similar, the new 7 speed transmition is fabulously smooth, the additional horsepower of the 550 vs. the old 500 is very noticable and the handling greatly improved. Also improved is the breaking which has eliminated the annoying ""cluncking"" sound and hesitation experienced in the 2003.  Still a problem seems to be the computer system operating the ABC (active body control system). It was a constant problem with my 2003 and unfortunately has once more shown up on my 2007.  The car was in the shop for 2 weeks while the computer part was flown in from Germany.  Aside from this one electrical problem, the car is fantastic."
car_4683,Near automotive perfection,"I say ""near"" because the audio and nav system perform and look like equipment several generations old. Programming involves unnecessary steps, the screen is bland with minimal color levels, and it completely washes out in sunlight which obviously is a detriment in a convertible. The system won't even provide street labeling unless fully zoomed in to max detail. The radio functions are only average and sound is mediocre. The system needs more speakers with improved sub woofers and tweeters. To make up for these deficiencies the interior and exterior is a work of art. Coupled with the increased power and improved handling it's near automotive nirvana on a warm Sunday top down drive."
car_4684,Great Car,"This is also my 3rd SL of this series (prev '04 and '06).  Tried to swith to either XKR or 650. Just not comparable. Love the improved handling, firmer brakes and increased power.  Quality still perfect. Note to other buyers. Make sure you get the Michelin Tires (versus Continentals).  Better ride."
car_4685,A Dream come true,"I had a Lexus SC430 leased for the last 4 years and I had been looking for a relacement. The Lexus was my first experience with a Non North American car. It was fun for a long time but did not give me the real sports car feeling. My Silver/red int. SL550 with AMG sport pack, and Pan Roof is a dream. Great power, very responsive, performance and handling is superior. The gas mileage is about the same as the SC430, but I have almost 100 more HP, much better handling and it's more fun to drive. I had tried the Jag, the BMW 6 and the Porsche but settled on the SL550. After 4 months I know I made the right decision."
car_4686,This Is It!,"This is absolutely amazing. To integrate total luxury with total performance (in an automatic) is an achievement. The handling is exceptional, particularly in sharp turns."
car_4687,2007 SL550,"This is my first SL and I love it. The car moves like it's connected directly to my brain. Steering is smooth and responsive. The engine and tranmission deliver loads of power, and braking is firm but well controlled. When you add in the superb fit and finish of the car, the amazing hardtop convertible, some of the sweetest exterior looks on the road, and this car is just fun to drive. Sure, there are a couple of things that could have been designed better, but they really aren't bad they way they are now."
car_4688,It doesn't get any better than this,"This is the best roadster I have ever driven.  I've owned Lexus, Corvette, NSX, BMW, and most recently the '07 Jaguar.  The SL 550 is vastly superior to them all.  The SL has an incredible combination of sport and luxury.  The interior is as nice or nicer than anything out there. The car handles superbly, and yet still has a very comfortable ride.  The seats are among the best I've ever seen. You can easily drive all day without killing your back.  The only drawbacks to the SL are the price, poor mileage, and, inexcusably, a very mediocre stereo and outdated NAV.  But the superior driving experience more than compensates for these shortfalls.  Drive one, it's worth the money."
car_4689,Dream car,"I picked up the silver SL550 with the AMG sport package, panoramic roof and red interior Thursday, Aug. 17. 2006. I turned in my leased 02 Lexus SC430, which was the best car I ever owned for quality and fun. At this point, 1200 miles, I am still pinching myself. Awesome performance and I love just to stare at it. The gas mileage I had read was bad, but already I don't notice any difference from my Lexus 430 V8. The only thing I miss from the Lexus is the tilting down rear view mirrors when reversing."
car_4690,2007SL550,"Traded 2005 SL500 on 2007 SL550.  As nice as the '05 was, the new '07 is more powerful, quieter' and has a much better steering feel."
car_4691,2007 Some good- some bad,"I previously owned a 2005 SL500.  The car is indeed more powerful reflecting the increase in horsepower.  I actually do not like some of the minor interior changes.  For instance, I do not like the change in the hard-top controller handle-switch.  The previous switch had a red light incorporated in it to indicate when the up or down function was complete.  The current switch no longer has this light indicator, and now you must turn your head around  to look.  I cannot figure out if the current model has voice control or not, while the '05 model voice control was standard.  I do like the bluetooth module allowing use of your personal phone."
car_4692,Fun and powerful,Terrific automobile. Only dissapointment is the technology used in the navigation system. It is at lease two generations behind Lexus.
car_4693,Stealth Race Car,"The 07 SL 55 has subtle but great improvements over prior model years.  The paddle shift is much better than the button set up on the prior AMG.  The ride with 19 inch rims is very smooth for a performance car.  Best of all it is somewhat stealth, at least here in So Cal as there are so many SL's running around.  My only disappointment is that the navi is still somewhat behind that of Acura and the sound system is good but not great. In a $130 K car you would think the sound system would be as good as the exhaust ""sound"".  All in all this is a dream car and feel lucky to own one.  Prior car was an 02 E55 and still love it but not a much as this SL 55   Duh!!"
car_4694,They Made It Even Better,"The addition of 50 HP has made a huge difference in this car.  I owned an '05 SL500, and the second you touch the gas pedal, you can feel the difference.  This car moves, and handles perfectly.  There have been slight alterations in the body style -- mostly to the front grill -- and the interior feels roomier.  It remains a car for the ages."
car_4695,Nothing exceed$ like exce$$,"Stylish. Average MPG 11. Cheap vinyl visors. Sits low, getting in/out hard. Average quality leather. Terrible navigation. Command system is technology from 80's Radio Shack computers. Outdated 6-cd changer. Unless you keep A/C on auto (which gets loud) awful mildew smell emits from inside car--unevaporated H2O in pump system. Some things don't work from 1st day like cupholder. Porsche & BMW = better handling but SL550 better than SC430. Interior leather & wood & ergonomics are better in Lexus by far! but are better than 911 & 650i. Sound system: 1=sc430, 2=BMW & Infiniti, 3=911 & SL550. Build quality sub-par, very bad. You buy this car for sense of prestige not because it's the best- it's not"
car_4696,Absolute Best Car I've Ever Driven,"I traded a 2007 Jag XK for the SL.  The Jag is beautiful, the SL is not only gorgeous, it is awe-inspiring when driving. It is more responsive, has a better ride, more power, and better seats--and--it has a hard top that looks great when up.  I've owned Lexus, Range Rover, NSX, Corvette, and several Jags and several BMWs--the SL 550 is head and shoulders above them all--it is absolutely the most fun of any car I've ever driven--and that includes the new Aston Vantage V8.  The SL is nimble,corners flat, is fast, and somehow still maintains a very comfortable ride.  I highly recommend it.  The only drawbacks are the price and the mediocre gas mileage."
car_4697,A refined SL,"This is my third SL since the new style was introduced in 2003. The 2007 model is the best I have driven to date. Everything in the car is updated and refined. If Mercedes quality whent down a bit, it is back to a higher standered with the 2007 edition."
car_4698,"None better, except for maybe the SL55","Driving doesn't get any better than this.  The new SL550 is markedly better than the car it replaced (the SL500). I've owned 2003, and 2005, SLs and the 2007 is a much better performing car"
car_4699,SL55 roaring thunder,"The best car I have ever driven. It has 
everything for a fun exciting driving 
experience and all the luxury plus."
car_4700,Redefining driving excitement,"This is the car everyone wants with 
good reason. Prior to taking delivery 
of my SL55, I drove a Honda S2000 (fun 
but very basic) and a 2003 SLK32 (too 
small, horrible steering response). 
Even with a weight of over two tons, 
the SL55's 493 horses will pin you to 
your seatback while surounding you with 
every conceivable luxury appointment. I 
drove SL55's at the Homestead-Miami 
Speedway in June's AMG Challenge, just 
to see what this beast could do when 
fully unleashed.  What a rush! Not your 
typical no-frills sports car, but a lot 
more fun to drive!"
car_4701,SL500,"Excellent car in everyway. I have been 
driving Sls since 1975 and this 
surpasses them all by a lot. It is a 
great looking car and handles just as 
well.Only thing missing is a sunglass 
holder."
car_4702,Get it,"the only problem I have found is with 
the breaks that they have promissed 
they will fix and the navigation needs 
improvement. But at least it works; 
unlike BMW 745 with a great NAV that 
does not work 1/2 the time."
car_4703,more fun than a roller coaster,"More on road performance than you could 
ever need on the open highway. This car 
performs superbly at high speed. 
Whether conering or racing down a 
straight stretch of road this car will 
amaze you. A luxury ride decieves you 
as you gaze out the window thinking you 
are travelling at maybe 2/3 your actual 
speed. Slowing down is no problem given 
the braking system on this vehicle. If 
you want to make your drive as 
enjoyable as possible you must own this 
car."
car_4704,Seat Belt problem??,"I love this car, but the drivers 
seatbelt starting acting up. I took it 
in three times in two weeks with a 
persistent and recurring problem. 
Anyone out there had a similar 
problem? How was it resolved? Anyone 
out there with similar experiences at 
Caliber? Could be the dealers service 
personnel not trained sufficiently to 
work on thee masterpieces."
car_4705,Heaven on earth,"I am 6'6"" tall and always wanted a 
convertible but could never fit.  The 
SL 500 gives me plenty of room.  It 
took a long time for dealers to realize 
that tall people love convertables, but 
it was worth the wait."
car_4706,Fantastic Five,"It is absolutely the best car I have 
ever owned and I've owned almost 60 
cars.  this is one that I will never 
get rid of.  It's stying, handling and 
performance leaves all the other cars 
in the dust."
car_4707,My 500 SL,"I had a 1998 500 SL before this one.  I 
was never crazy about that car.  It was 
bulky and difficult to drive.  This one 
is sleek, attractive and lots of fun to 
drive."
car_4708,MY DREAM CAR,"FUN TO DRIVE, RELIABLE, HANDLES WELL, 
GREAT LOOKS, EVERY CONVENIENCE-MUCH 
BETTER THAN PREVIOUS SL SERIES-SAFE, 
POWERFUL-FRANKLY, JUST A DREAM!"
car_4709,I Love This Car!,"Most responsive car I have ever 
driven.  Acceleration is ""seamless,"" 
with no hesitation at all.  It corners 
like a race car.  Taking curves is more 
fun than a straightaway."
car_4710,my SL500,"Whats not to love about this rocket 
luxury car!"
car_4711,Perfect Two-Seater,"I ordered this car after 9/11 and 
waited un til I did not have to pay a 
premium (actually received the car in 
10/02).  A squeek took a few visits to 
fix, but M-B did ""everything"" to take 
care of it.  It is a dream to drive -- 
hard to believe it is so firm, even 
with the top down.  Absolutely no cowl 
shake.  A real looker."
car_4712,SL 500,"Truly the best engineered car I have 
owned.  It is my 4th SL.  The 
convertible hard-top also has a glass 
panoramic roof.  Highway mileage is 
nearly 23 miles per gallon at 8o mph. 
The ride firmness is adjustible for 
Sunday comfort or serious cornering. 
Very quiet with the top down, which is 
as often as possible"
car_4713,Mercedes supercar,"I just got this car a few months ago, 
february 2004, and since the first 
test drive, I loved it. I sold a 
ferrari 355 to buy this car, and it 
was worth it. It is just as fast as 
the ferrari, yet infinitly more 
civilized, practical, comfortable, 
luxurius... This is truly the best car 
in the world, fast, comfortable, rolls 
royce level of fit and finish."
car_4714,not too bad,"I bought this SL500 last summer and so 
far it has been a reliable, comfortable 
car that also handles like a Porsche. I 
am not too sure about the exterior 
styling. Some people mistake my car for 
an SLK which is a lot cheaper. I don't 
know about you, but I hate that! 
Otherwise, this is a wonderful sports 
car loaded with convenience features 
and Mercedes cachet."
car_4715,THIS CAR IS THE BEST EVER!,AWESOME! IN EVERY WAY!
car_4716,Incredible Driving Machine,"An incredible driving machine with 
superb mechanics. Unfortunately the 
electronics are sadly dated (10yrs??). 
Absolutely love driving the vehicle. 
Most fun in an automobile in years.  
Just wish Mercedes had looked at 
Japanese and/or American makes to see 
where todays electronics are.  I have 
spent more time studying the manual 
than for all the many previous autos I 
have owned,combined! Why does setting 
radio presets have to be complicated??  
Come on Mercedes make it a perfect auto 
with updated electronics."
car_4717,I love the SL55AMG,"The SL55AMG is by far the best car in the 
world. It has then hard top convertible and 
all the specifcations you can want. The only 
poor thing is that you can't get in a the 
charcoal colour. The interior is really 
comfortable and it has a massage system 
which is really relaxing."
car_4718,Awesome!,"This car is a delight to drive, and a 
privilege to own.  Superb handling, 
outstanding styling, and a mechancial 
marvel.  I savor each and every 
driving experience.  In short, this 
car is intoxicating."
car_4719,2004 sl500r,perfect in every way
car_4720,Great car!,"After owning my SL500 for over a year, 
I am still thrilled everytime I climb 
in and drive away.  Although I travel a 
lot for business and don't get to drive 
my car as much as many do, this car is 
still the consumate sports car and gets 
a second look from a lot of people.  
All in all, the best ride I've ever had."
car_4721,Nothing like it...,"This is my third SL-500,  Customer 
service at my dealership is impeccable, 
the car itself is amazing.  I love 
driving it.  Is it expensive?... 
probably...  am I worth it?....You bet!
Will ever drive anything else?...NEVER!"

the tiger in the engine.  Might I add, 
fun to drive.  A real looker."

road to steering wheel marriage."
car_4724,Flawless,"Flawless performance.  Beautiful 
styling in and out.  It looks exactly 
the way it performs.  Responds 
instantly to accelerator.  Can easily 
get ahead of other vehicles and into 
clear road ahead.  Handling is superb. 
Does not lean or sway.  Beautifully 
takes curves with ease.  Quintessential 
sports car.  Wish it had more cabin 
storage, and that it had a better gas 
mileage."
car_4725,The best of the best,"Every red blooded American male dreams 
about owning a car like this. It is 
sexy, stylish and extremely powerful. I 
have the limited edition Designo sports

where ever I go. It doesn't get any 
better than this."

when I first saw the 300SL in Cleveland. Everything

car_4752,You cant go wrong!,"I first drove the 03 model in Vegas
through an excellent package from the
Ritz -Carlton & MBUSA, for an additional

with this car, I had owned 2 previous
generations of SL' an 81 and a 71.

car_4754,11 years of cruising bliss,"I've owned the 1998 SL 500 since 2006 when I bought it with 51000 miles.  I am the third owner and each time the car was sold by a MB dealer.  I now have 76000 miles on it and my only repair cost was replacing a coil.  I have gone to the dealer for routine maintenance and paid a small premium. I have the original hydraulic cylinders and top.  The car drives like new and has cost me very little over the 11 year period, while giving me great pleasure.  I considered replacing it with a 2005 550 model but my wife felt the R129 body was such a classic we should just keep it.  It's not worth very much on the market now but It's worth a lot to us.  We tested a large number of cars before buying but who can argue with a design that allows you to talk on a cell phone at 70 MPH with the top down and windows up.  Not the most powerful car on the road but incredible torque for passing in the 45 to 80 MPH range.  Our car is beautiful and we get positive comments everywhere we go.  What's not to like?"
car_4755,"sl500 is a gem, I will forever own one!","These cars are amazing, and to buy one now, you can be sure to get a much better deal than the brand new price tag of $100K.  Not alot to warn you about other than you will be at the gas station more frequently than the average car as this baby likes gas a lot.  other than that, she is a beaut.  for someone like me, 6.4 tall, she can be a bit snug getting in and out of the drivers side, but the passengers side is not a problem at all."
car_4756,My SL500 is my baby!,"I have owned this car since 2001 and I can say that it is still a thrill to drive every time I get behind the wheel. This car has been super reliable and almost maintenance free. Just regular care as you would do with any car, and no major repairs.She has a little over 80K miles on her now, and still runs like new.I also own an '06 C55 AMG as my daily driver. Very fast and stiff ride. Also enjoyable, but I would take the SL500 any day, if I had to choose just one.I love how this site has 100% 5 star ratings from owners of this car. I totally understand it too.Cheers!"
car_4757,I finally bought my dream car.,"Words can't express the thrill I get every time I get into this car.I'm just 32 and I've loved the r129 SL500 since I first saw it as a kid.I looked all over the US and about booked a flight to Texas to buy a car when a buddy of mine called to let me know his dad just bought a low mileage car for his lot.I drove down to his lot and saw my 98 Mercedes SL500 sitting there with only 46,000 on the clock.I test drove it then went to lunch came back and paid for it.We have put 7,000 miles on it in just two months.I love the feel, touch and power of this amazing cruiser.I even don't mind the fuel costs I'm getting about 17city and our trip to Florida we were able to get 25.4."
car_4758,You should own a V12 once in your life!,"Just bought this beautiful SL600 Sport, all black. With only 52k miles it drives like a new car! After considerable research, I went with the 48 valve V 12 because the newer bi- turbo versions are much less reliable and have far more plastic. If you drive one, you will fall in love with it. Driving reasonably I am getting 17 mpg with 70% around town, 30% highway, what a nice surprise for a 400 hp V-12. These cars had 1 man who built each engine and the smooth delivery of power has to be felt to be believed. I know they are expensive to repair, the drive is worth it though. Awesome stereo with Sirius radio (highly recommended). Just driving the car feels special.~$125k when new. A bargain now!"
car_4759,not to be missed,"I owned a 1956 190SL while stationed in Germany when I was a much younger man and always wanted another one. Well I couldn't afford that '56 now but the modern engineering, comfort and style of my ""new"" SL make up for it. Sitting in this one I can see and feel the DNA connection to that beautiful '56. You will not regret owning and driving this masterpiece. Shop wisely, do your homework, then enjoy. Very affordable."
car_4760,LUV this car,"Bought car 2 years ago with 13,000 miles on odometer. May have paid too much from dealer but what a great car! Knowing repair cost can be expensive I opted for extended warranty-waste of money so far. Great power, smooth ride, classic design, handles well. Probably be buried in this auto."
car_4761,SL500 SL1 & Panoramic Roof,"I had driven a 1984 380SL for a while in 1987 and fell in love! Fast forward twenty years, and I decided to go with the R129, and 1998 was the last year for the twin cam 48 valve engine, so I looked for the Sport model with a Panoramic roof. Love the car! Very glad I went this route. The hard top still feels more ""open"" being mostly glass, so winter is less of a drag. I just feel good driving it, anywhere, anytime. I've had a number of nice cars, but the SL is extraordinary in so many ways that I believe I will always want one. My wife and I take trips with our 45 pound Golden Retriever and even she loves it! Service is costly, but not frequent, so I highly recommend this fantastic machine!!!"
car_4762,"Nothing Else Compares, Nothing","I am the original owner of this car, my last SL I kept for 16 yrs; I plan to keep this car, hell I plan to be buried in this car.  It is a head turner, a turn taker, nothing is safer.  After 10 years I still think 'wow' every time I climb in and crank it up.  I don't even look at other cars on the road, and I have owned them all. PS In ten years, aside from regular service the car has been 'in the shop' ONCE"
car_4763,"Finally, a happy wife.","I have purchased MANY cars for my wife in hopes that she would be happy with what she is driving.  After 17 years, I finally found one that she refuses to even look at another kind of car.  This is fun in the sun, and glamor all year round.  This last year there was 18"" of snow, once we got the car out of the drive, I was passing 4X4's and cruising down the road without issues.  We get about 18mpg in town and 23mpg highway. Virtually no road noise with hardtop on who cares how much noise with the top down.  Every time my wife gets in  it, she tells me how much she loves her little car.  Thank you MB"
car_4764,Awesome,"I'm a girl, but have always been a car nut.  My first car was a little used Mazda RX7 which I really enjoyed, but was convinced to sell by my granny who thought I would kill myself in it - haha.  Since then I've owned about thirty or so cars, most of the time buying used, driving, then reselling.  Among these, have been several BMWs (3,5 & 7 series), an '87 911, an '85 380SL, a 91 Jaguar XJS, Mustangs (old and new bodies), etc.; and I can honestly say that my SL500 is a KEEPER.  I love the way it handles, looks, and its reliability.  I've even learned to slow down in it (a little).  Definitely recommend!"
car_4765,Great Vaule and Superior Performance,"With 130,000 miles my black beauty is making people look. A road trip out West delivered top performance and comfort. Wished they had an auto tilt on the steering column instead pushing the button . Maintenance has always been a priority and the pre-owned warranty was well worth it. Alternator gave out at 120K, air condition replace at 60K, Headers replaced at 60K along with seat trim. All under warranty saving me over $4k. Do go without it. I firmly believe in the Starmark brand and only buy pre-owned. Front cow under bumper as well as inside wheel well covers go if you hit a parking bumper (too low) Need to re-paint and detail the interior to bring it back to A shape. Go get one now!"
car_4766,MB's Finest!,This is the first Mercedes I have owned and I do not believe I will ever own another type of vehicle. Both interior and exterior design are excellent and the overall quality is exceptional. The handling and reliability far exceed any expectations. This is a true driver's car! Definitely worth the price! This car is rock solid - built like a tank but handles like a sports car - feels very safe.  The mechanics of the soft- top and ease with getting the hard-top in place are a true testimate to Mercedes fine engineering capabilities.
car_4767,Wow what a dfference,"The SL500 is a thrill to drive. It's fast, responsive and very comfortable. I had a 560SL 1989 before this and it was great but this car is superb in every way. Pricey to repair but the ride and fun makes it worth it. I expect to get many good driving years out of it.  After all, it is a Mercedes."
car_4768,V-12 SL class,"A good ride and is very, very fast. Love the style of the body and hard top. Sweet car!"
car_4769,The SL to own right now.,"Drives like a dream with the looks and comfort one would expect from a high end Merc.  I always feel like a million bucks driving this car.  Great handling and easy to drive.  What is not to like about this thing?!?  With the latest body style now around for a few years, prices have really dropped on these cars and they are well worth the money.  I for one love the stock stereo."
car_4770,Great value - near prefect sports car,"I was driving an E420 and felt it a 
bit lacking in, well, fun! My search 
included Porsches and Vettes but I 
decided on an SL class. New body style 
hit the market and these started to 
fall within reach of a whole new 
buyer's market. I sugest buying on 
condition rather than mileage. High 
miles just means you'll pay less not 
that you'll get less car. Repairs can 
be costly as with any high-end 
automobile. Hardtop starage is a 
problem for those with limited space 
i.e. apartment/condo dwellers. In 
Chicago, its off by tax day and on by 
halloween so you'll be storing it half 
the year. AMG Sorts package is the 
best value."
car_4771,A SUPER AUTOMOBILE,"This vehicle is a thrill to drive and 
it is everything Mercedes says it is.

car_4773,SL500,"The SL500 is a dream vehicle. The 
power to weight ratio makes it a 
thrill to drive. Although it is a 
sports car it drives like a touring 
sedan. I can drive for hours and not 
feel tired of driving, like in others 
vehicles I have driven. It is a 
stylish vehicle that always turns 
heads. The engineering of the vehicle 
never ceases to amaze me. The only 
drawback has been the storage of the 
hardtop while not in use (9 months in 
New Orleans). The design engineers 
have corrected that in 2002, but I 
still love the body style of the 1998."
car_4774,1998 Mercedes 500 SL sport w SL1/SL2 opt,"This is a one of the top model for 
Mercedes 50yrs of SL making. With no

super responsive. cornering with 18inch

911, a BMW M3, a 740i and a 850 and both
a Ferrari Testarossa and a 550 Maranello
 I have to admit this is the top of my
list in overall satisfaction.It has more
raw power than even the 550, and yet it
is controlled by the latest technology
that gives you the opportunity to snarl

and horse power. Great design and all

Thank you Mercedes!"
car_4819,SLick550,"I have owned a 2013 sl550 for about 6 weeks now. If you like a comfortable, good handling, fast car, look no further. Yeah, a 911 might be a better sport car, but this is a classy, sweet ride. Acceleration is awesome. With over 500 foot pounds of torque, it will make your ears flatten.    Can’t tell you about repairing, haven’t had it long enough."
car_4820,First SL550 but third Mercedes Benz,"If you are a Mercedes enthusiast and considered buying an SL550 for your retirement years, don't hesitate but choose the 2013 or newer.  The improvements with this new redesign starting with the 2013 are well worth the extra it costs. It is a fantastic car and worth every penny. I have no regret purchasing mine and plan to keep it as long as I can drive, and then park it in the garage and just look at it."
car_4821,"Great Car,  So So Sound System","I own the 2013 SL550 with basically all options ( except the Bang & Olufsen sound system upgrade). My car has the Harman Kardon standard sound.  To be honest the sound is mediocre at best, I was expecting much better from a 6 digits car. I like to drive and enjoy a good sound and the Harman Kardon seem to missing bass response, the subwoofer seems under powered and all the sound comes from the front of the car.  I even took the car to Mercedes to have a sound check and they told me my system was up to specks.     Except for the sound, however, I am quite happy with the car. The torque is fantastic!  Steering is not as precise as a 911 but the car does not want to be a sport car, it is a very conformable cruiser and is quite enjoyable even at slow speed.  I had a 2010 M3 before and that car was no fun at everyday speed. UPDATED REVIEW 6/19/2017  I took the car to Mercedes dealer to figure out if there was something wrong with the sound. After checking the car for 2 days they told me the car sound system was fine. (Actually I had the impression they treated me as I was crazy!  )    At that point, I tried on the internet if there was an explanation.  I found this explanation  ""The sound is surround sound and the rear speakers don't produce much sound unless listening to a DVD-Audio disc and there is no front to back volume adjustment.  Without a DVD-Audio disc  ( a defunct system)  I  the sound is unacceptable, with too much volume coming from the front speakers. ""   So I realized the sound was tuned to DVD Audio : I follow the remedy I found on the web and added a separate rear speakers amplifier and a subwoofer and the sound is now great. But it was really disappointing that Mercedes tuned the sound of one of their flagship cars so poorly and without giving guidelines for a remedy."
car_4822,Most Capable Motorcar,"I was approached not long after purchasing the SL by a gentlemen who has owned a good number of exotic and sports cars.  In his words, ""the SL is what all cars want to be when they grow up"".  I could not agree more.  You may find a sportier car or two, a better looking luxury car, or a car that covers great distances in extreme comfort; but the SL does all of that, and more.  This car loves to eat road, top up is like a coupe; solid and silent.  Top down is like, well, a high performance convertible.  The SL has become our grand touring car and it has proven itself to be most worthy in every instance.  We went the CPO route, which lessens the pain of the check book, but provides solid Mercedes warranty and support.  Drive the other contenders, then drive an SL.  It continues to amaze with it's power, torque, ease of operation, and rock solid build quality.  And while the looks may be contentious to some, this car draws admiring looks in even the most discerning crowds.  It does not disappoint."
car_4823,SL550 nice and confortable,SL550 nice and confortable
car_4824,Is it a Prince or a Frog? Definitely a Prince,"I have been fortunate through the years to own a lot of premium sports cars and the SL was not one of them or even on my ""Top 5"" list.This time around, my ""wants"" changed, with comfort, amenities and room as a top priority. Because of the new SL's aluminum construction and bi-turbo V8, it was added as a possibility.After driving everything else out there, I finally drove a new SL.  It's agility, raw power and amenities were surprising, but the exterior lines seemed disjointed. UPDATE 11/2016This car has not disappointed me in any way. It has been problem free, and its performance limits are beyond anything I had expected. I replaced the wheel and tire package with aftermarket 20"" wheels and non run flat tires. I also added the factory rear spoiler.  I hate run flat tires which come with the car, and the new wheels and spoiler give the car a more performance look. I have owned many nice cars in the past, but this car has definitely exceeded my expectations.    I bought the SL, added custom wheels and the rear factory spoiler and I am very pleased. These additions seem minor, but they changed the entire look of the car and I am pleased."
car_4825,SL550 as every day driver,"The strength of the SL is that is sort of like a 2 passenger GT Touring luxury vehicle.Compares with Maserati, Jaguar XK, & BMW 650.This car is the peak of technology and easy to learn.Holds two tour golf bags in trunk with top up and one with top down.The negative is that the look is getting a little boring.Even though it is different from the 2012, it is only slightly different.Inside is major, outside is not.I ding the value on this car, not because it is not the best of its competition, which it is, but because they lose so much money the first year.Outside of that, the car does so much more than its competitor and does the more excellently."
car_4826,A Great Value as a Used Car,"The newest of the R129 cars (last built in 2001) is now 16 years old. Automotive engineering has progressed a long way in the interim. My daughter told me that her 2014 Nissan Altima rides better than my 2001 SL 500 and I agree with her. That said, the R129 is one fine automobile. No Mercedes Benz is a sports car but they corner well and have a comfortable ride even if they don't quite match the highway ride of a new car. What's not to like about a 300+ horsepower vehicle that gets 26 mpg on the freeway and has a smooth shifting 5-speed automatic that always seems to be in the right gear or quickly downshifts to a lower gear for any situation? The car was @$84,000.00 new. Fourteen years later I bought it with 37,500 miles on the car for @15% of the original purchase price. Things that I don't like about the car- my SL is a few inches longer than my 2015 Mercedes GLK250 but has less driver leg room (it has enough legroom for my 6'-01"" frame but it is not excessive); the beautiful chrome 18"" sport wheels need regular waxing or they will rust in a heartbeat and MB strongly cautions against the use of chains and/or cable chains on these rims (not convenient in a region where the occasional surprise snowfall happens); the view backing out of a parking space is not as good as I would like; the car has been very reliable, the local MB dealer less so. Overall a fine car that is lots of fun to drive."
car_4827,Bullet Proof,"I've owned my SL 500 for five years. No, as in none, maintenance expense beyond routine oil and fluid changes. I bought it with 42,000 miles. 48,000 now. Suburban driving only. A/C is great in Arizona summers. Cars and Coffee monthly, Club car shows, out to dinner a couple of times a month and now being used for routine trips too. We have a CLS 550 and a GLE 350 as well so quite familiar with the Mercedes-Benz brand. Two previous owners: None under 65. The high beams didn't work when we got the car...probably never out at night! After a couple of on/off high beam flashes, the high beams started working fine. So it goes with the car. Subsequently, traded on a 2013 SL 550 with 7,000 miles and warranty to seven years. Why? Easy to drop the top, dynamic seats, ventilated seats, lots of safety features enjoyed on CLS and GLE. Sigh every time a 129 SL passes.I traded the car in on a R231 SL550 as the new technology was appealing as was the trade-in price offered by my retailer...he had a buyer for a concours quality R129. I miss the lovely colors and analog driving experience...until I want to put the top down or listen to my music."
car_4828,Wish I would have gotten one sooner!,"Was shopping for a Mustang GT when I came across this beauty. One test drive and I was hooked. After having owned many sports cars their is no comparison. I have had C3, C4, C5 Corvettes, Many Mustangs, MGB's, MR5's, 350Z's, just to name a few. Not one of them could even come close to the fit and finish of this Mercedes. I was parked right next to a brand new Corvette at a car show so I had plenty of time to study the fine details of the paint etc. Mind you my Mercedes is already 14 years old. Looking close at the Vet then at the Mercedes it was no contest! The paint on the Vet had small waves in it the Mercedes was like a mirror. The materials used in the interior of the Corvette looked like they came from Walmart. Fourteen years old and the thick leather and plush carpet still look new on the Mercedes. The car oozes quality. Granted the Corvette looked way more flashy and in race would win hands down. But if I had to drive cross country the SL500 would be my pick. At 80 mph I was able to let go of the steering wheel and let the car track down the road straight as an arrow. The car handles as if it is on rails, very stable and just a joy to drive."
car_4829,Classic open road cruiser!,"This SL500 wasn't my first choice. I went to a dealer to look at a 2002 Porsche Carrera convertible but it had just been sold. The sales guy asked me if I'd like to look at a low mileage SL500. I'm glad I did. The triple black AMG SL500 had only 8K on the clock and looked new. Then I drove it. It's a classic cruiser, not a sports car but who cares! It's fast, beautiful and a blast to drive with the top down."
car_4830,Best all around driving automobile!,"I purchased my 2001 SL500 from a dealership in Calfornia two weeks ago and drove it to Idaho. This Mercedes is the best all around automobile that I have ever had the pleasure of driving. The handling was fantantic, the performance is unbelievible, especially at top end. My other two super performance cars are a 03 & a 06 Z06 Corvettes which are dream cars, but the Mercedes is just the total package. An all around great driving car. You just feel great driving in it. My Mercedes is Red with Black leather interior. It has 44,000 miles on it. An engineering marvel!"
car_4831,Exceptional SL600 (R129 series),"Exceptional 2001 SL600; purchased pre-owned from a dealer who'd gotten from the orignal owner. Totally stock,black, V12, 275/35 18s in back, 245/40 18s front, only 11,000 miles! Guess it just wasn't cool anymore for the country-club. Built like classic Benz cars were in-the-day. Heavy - more of a GT than a sports car; wonderful to cruise on the highway at any speed. V12 engine with 48-valves is a symphony. 5-speed automatic.  Torque like locomotive. Low-down, brooding-and-mean looking, but a total gentleman. Leather everywhere. Wonderful, can border on scary-fast acceleration, but totally controlled  Well cared-for examples are known to be reliable if maintained."
car_4832,The SL experience,"I have a beautiful '85 SL and an '04 E series for my wife and this 500 is the bomb. You feel special driving this car and it is the classic MB roadster experience.  The handling is very responsive considering the weight of the car. The 18"" rubber  helps.  The performance is all you ever need (I'm willing to give up a little hair raising bullet speed for more creature comforts at my age). The torque is story here and just keeps coming. Very smooth and responsive.  The cabin is very comfortable and at speed with the hard top on, you're hard pressed to remember you're not in a fixed top coupe.  The trunk is ample and will hold a set of golf club or several shopping bags"
car_4833,"Timeless Roadster, Fun for Everyday","This roadster is making presence on the road, parking lot or garage. Puts a smile on owners face every time is driven. Abundant performance, whisper quiet with the top down. It feels very safe to be in on the road even when surrounded by SUV's. Hardtop feature is extremely usefull when cold and it improves body flex. Sport package must to have since it makes this car to stand out of the crowd and it helps to keep the resale value. Reliability is far better than new R230. Everything in this car is overbuild for quality, but you pay the price in extra weight and extra $$. Great highway cruiser."
car_4834,Life is boring without a Mercedes benz!,Just picked the car up last week.  My second MB.  First was a 2000 CLK 320 Cab.  Loved that one.  This one is an absolute monster!  Perfect blend of sport and luxury!  The car has unbelievable road manners.  Will give you more than enough power to pass just about anything on the road while still giving me that classic MB experience.  Much better suited to my driving habits compared to my CLK.  I hope this thing lasts a very long time...I'm expecting it to.
car_4835,Great to buy used,"I purchased my SL55 AMG in Feb of 2010.The bad... had to repair air suspension on front and back.The good... MB significantly reduced the cost of the repair.The excitement of most new car purchases ware off in a month or so.Not this car.I look forward to driving this car every day.Performance is very good, looks are great with top up or down.I can't belive how well it handles based on the weight being over 4,300 lbs.It goes where ever you point it with plenty of power on tap.It is a shame this care does not come with a license to speed. Pay the extra cost for the AMG.It is definately worth it."
car_4836,Excellent build quality,"Great car..if you lie performance in a good looking package, then this is your car. i upgraded my heat exchanger, intercooler pump, and my crank shaft pulley to really make the car a BEAST!!! you can easily add an ECU upgrade and make this car a monster to drive! have fun"
car_4837,Love It!!!,I bought this car because I wanted a toy. Something to drive on nice days with the top down. The car is beautiful. People stop me all the time to tell me what a nice car it is. It looks great weather the top is up or down. I don't really get to open it up because here in Chicago there is always too much traffic but I have driven it late at night and the car is a rocket. It sounds great when you start it and press on the gas and heads will turn to look where the roar is coming from.
car_4838,SL600,"This is a great car and my second SL, the other is an 1994 SL500 and it is also a great car. the difference in eleven years is astounding. the 05 has every available option except heated steering wheel, it was a CA car.  amazed at the MPG on freeway, went to Cleveland a week ago, about 100 mi with 90 on I71, the goofy thing indicated 24.6 MPG!! used the distronic, I thought that would be joke, nope,  it is great touched the brake/throttle once in 90 freeway miles. speed was set at 70(this is Ohio)we have a unique way of collecting road tax here. The push in the seat is addictive, another 100 hp would not make much difference, would be interesting to see another 400 hp."
car_4839,AMG road trip,"I recently purchased a pre-owned low mileage 2005 SL55 AMG, and to get it home I had to make an 1800 mile run across the country. What a wonderful trip! I found the car quiet and comfortable with exceptional road manners. Never a tired leg or back muscle after a long day on the road. If you like, the 55 is an amazing performance car, or if you want to take it easy and enjoy the luxury features, it'll do that too. Both worlds are extreme in this super car, and it never fails to get lots of attention wherever you go. Styling and performance are second to none. Maybe more bells and whistles than I really need, but I'm still learning to appreciate them. Easily the greatest car I've ever driven."
car_4840,This is great,"My fourth Benz.  No problems, just plain fun.  Looks good, unbelievable power.  Surprising amount of room with the top up.  First thing I did was take a two week road trip from Minneapolis to Denver to South Padre, Texas and back.  Plenty of room for golf clubs and all our gear.  Was a short 5000 miles as fast as this car moves and I was ready to go again right after we got back.  Once a day (sometimes more) I get complimented ""great car"".  Might be the last passenger car I'll ever buy."
car_4841,My 2005 SL55,"The car is well balanced, great response. The upgrade in the leather is way overpriced. If you wanted black leather interior it was not avalible, charcoal not black, unless you bought the upgraded leather interior.  I have 12000 miles on the car with no problems. The one negative is that it is very easy to speed, the car wants to get up and go!  If you want a SL and have an extra $30,000 to spend, go for the SL55."
car_4842,Sports and luxury combined.,"After test driving several convertible sports cars including the BMW 6 series and the Porcsche Carrera I found the SL 55 to be by far the best available combination of fun, luxury and safety. As an additional bonus when the top is up the cabin is so quiet you would never know you're driving a convertible"
car_4843,SL 500,"Geat body style and excellent handling.  It would be helpful if the trunk were an inch wider and deeper to accomodate two golf bags.  Averaging 21.5 mpg.  Negatives: Command system reliability.  Navagation and sound system occasionally malfunctions.  Sound system not up to par for a $100,000 vehicle.  No fade control on sound system."
car_4844,Best GT car you can buy!!!,"This car is simply amazing. From its 604 horsepower to its elegant and civil nature, this car offers it all. If you are looking for an all out performance car you wan to take to the track, the SL65 is not for you. This car is all about the everyday driving experience. The power is nothing short of incredible. The car does have trouble getting off the line cleanly, but its purpose is not to be a dragster. The power is best used for passing, and passing is does. Hanlding is plenty ample but nothing to get all that excited about. Creature comforts, build quality, and techno-gadgets are what you'd expect from a top-of-the-line Mercedes, but the COMAND system can be a bit intimidating at first."
car_4845,I love this car!,"This is a awesome straight line monster.  My wife and I love taking I- 95 and heading to Miami for any reason.  The ability to pass anything at anytime is unbelievable.  If you want a luxury performance vehicle, you can't beat the quality of the ride at the speeds of the best racing cars in the world."
car_4846,Sweet,"This is a sweet drive.  It is definitely a drifter.  Hitting the pedal while turning will cause fishtailing as it it too powerful.  Sometimes it feels like driving a bar of butter on a hot-plate. .. Backend is unruly until traction control kicks in (a second or 2).  Otherwise, awsome car."
car_4847,Best ever,"Is it a coupe or is it a convertible?  It is both and the best ever of each.  After 4700 mi. I am a happy camper.  It is safe, it is solid, and it is beautiful.  If I put my foot into it, it is faster than my Viper.  If i don't, it gets the same mileage as my Lexus.  If you can afford it, this car is the true pinnacle of design and performance."
car_4848,Can't Hate It,"Build quality is not like the old SL's and it's been back to the dealer many times for problems with transmission, brakes, water leaks, accessory malfunctions.  But it's so beautiful and fun to drive that you can't hate it."
car_4849,My second SL500  in 2 years,"After driving a 2003 SL 500 for nearly 2 years,I was able to upgrade 2 years at an attractive year-end price. I thought it would be about the same car, but the improvements, especially the new 7 forward speed transmission, makes this the finest performing Benz in 5 that I have owned in the past several years. The driving and performance experience is exhilerating."
car_4850,A true fantasy car,"This car is truly a dream car.  Superior acceleration, Awesome exterior. My wife loves it so much she has decided to get the SL65 by January 2006.  Imagined being the best looking car on the road(exception DB9), and the fastest car around(Bar None).  The guys running the nitro will need a lot more than that to keep up. If you have the duckies, this car is worth the money, although I have had a few minor problems with the computers.  But the positive outweighs the negative by far."
car_4851,500SL Review,"After owning 2 other 500SL's, I can say that Mercedes finally got it right. The balance between luxury and sport is magnificent. I do not feel like I'm riding on a truck chassis in the 2005 model. In the previous SL's I did. This car is luxury. Comfortable, yet very tight in terms of handling. It truly hugs the road while giving the feeling of being in a luxury automobile. The interior and exterior lines of the vehicle are very well thought out. It is a very classy automobile."
car_4852,Just the best!,I've had my SL for nearly a month now. Have not regretted it since the moment I drove it off the lot. Just wish the engine was a little more responsive at acceleration as my former CLK. Pure heaven driving this car! Thinking about it? Go for it!
car_4853,My SL55,"I bought this SL55 after owning a SL500. When I bought the SL500 I was in awe. It was a great car.  I made a mistake one day and drove the SL55 when I stopped by the showroom to have my SL500 serviced.  The difference was unbelievable..The car has the style, power and drives like no other.  If anyone is looking to buy the ultimate convertible, the SL55 is it!"
car_4854,SL55 AMG,Awesome power. Fun to drive. navigation system is very cumbersome and difficult to use. There is a lag when you jump on the accelerator.
car_4855,Still the King,"What a feeling!  My nephew said while driving my SL500, ""Tt's hard not to look smug when you're driving this.""  Wonderful car.  Too many complicated electonic features.  I have to wade through five instruction manuals to find what should be a simple procedure. Thank goodness the only option I got was the Keyless Go.  The hardtop operation is superb.  The rear windscreen takes all the unpleasant blowing out of driving with the top back.  Very quiet operation with the top up.  Much more trunk room than the Lexus SC430.  Dealers will deal on price, even if they deny it publicly."
car_4856,SL500 convertible,"I have owned Mercedes for over 20 years and this model has got to be the best one yet. The handling is superb, along with its sleek lines. I would recommend this car to anyone who can acquire it. This is a fun car to drive and is very dependable. Both my brothers in law have also purchsed one on my recommendation."
car_4857,Some disappointments.  No regrets,"The biggest disappointment is with lack of traction.  You get on it with traction control off, and the tires spin. With ATC on, the car responds by actually coming to a halt right after take off.  You nurse the pedal, and start wondering if you should have saved a few $K and bought a SL600. The convenience features controls are very inconvenient as one goes through the menues to change settings, etc. Also a few electrical problems with the convenience package: Driver's seat won't retract on exit.  Car won't start easily if left parked for 2 or more days. ""1-"" or ""2 Malfunctions, Convenience Functions Unavailable"" is often displayed with no indications of the problem.  Then corrects itself"
car_4858,Trading performance for luxury,"After 4 recalls on my 2002 BMW M3 I thought I would get a convertible and drop some performance for luxury.  I was tempted to wait the 6 months to get a SL55 AMG, but decided that I would rather settle for the base SL500.  Couldn't be happier with the car.  Only thing I would change is put the cruise control stick on the right side as I tend to hit it often when I am trying to tap my blinkers.  The drop top is so fast, I can switch from top up to top down at a stop light and watch as everyone around me stares at the cool mechinisms that move the top.  Hard to beat hard top comfort in the winter with top down crusing in the summer. Down side of keyless, I forget to leave the key for valet ;)."
car_4859,Droptop fun,"After six months of driving this car, it is still a joy to get into.  I have always enjoyed cars.  This one simply takes it to another level."
car_4860,Happy,"Love it! I have several vehicles and this one is a toy just for a kick. But I have found I am enjoying it more than any of my previous toys,(Corvette, 430 SLK, Jag XJS & BMW's)Power,comfort, handling and all in the best looking car on the market."
car_4861,Waste your $100K on something else,"This is a beautiful car to look at and that's about it. I sold a 911 and bought a new 05' SL500 six months ago. I have owned many cars and the SL ranks amongst the least fun to drive. It is also not a well-built vehicle. All the stuff you read about Mercedes Benz being unreliable is true. The roof has been rattling since day one and the dealer has not been able to fix it yet. The engine sounds like a diesel under 40 mph, apparently they all sound like this. The 7-speed transmission is not very smooth and affects the car's performance.  The A/C blows cold air all the time. Radio and other instrument controls are poorly designed and hard to figure out. It only has 10 FM presets."
car_4862,SL 500,"Truely great and stylish car! I would reccomend it to anyone looking in the $80,000 plus range. I owned a Jaguar XK8 before my SL and after having driven both I can say that the Mercedes is clearly better."
car_4863,0-60 in: Whoa!!,"Although this is one of the heaviest sports cars that I have ever driven, this car will go 0-60 in (I have tested) 4.0 seconds. This is .5 seconds less that the advertisement. This car is really very fun to drive as well. I recommend that you buy it."
car_4864,You gotta get one!,"I have had several Mercedes over the years, and this is the 2nd AMG version I have had. I originally had a CLK55 Cab and decided to trade it in on an SL500. I soon was dissapointed at the performance of the standard SL500 and within a week traded my 04 SL500 for an 05 SL55. This by far is the best car I have owned. I love the looks on my friends faces who drive 360 Ferrari's when I out accelerate and out drive them in the canyons."
car_4865,Black SL65,I drive this car every day and enjoy each and every minute of it!  The power is unlike any other vehicle I have ever driven.  Mercedes definiteley delivered this time with AMG!  I love my SL65 and I highly recomend it.
car_4866,Best SL Ever,"The automatic hard top makes this car a pleasure to drive in our cold Chicago winters. No more drafty canvas tops. The car has impressive handling and an interior to die for.  I can get my golf clubs in the trunk with top down unlike the Cadillac XLR.  Everything about this car is refined.  If I needed more speed, the SL600 does 0-60 mph in under 4 seconds; however, that would just get me in trouble.  The ventilated seats and keyless go are great options.  This is no doubt the finest roadster available short of the SLR."
car_4867,SL55,Great car. Navigation should be DVD not CD based. Performance is exceptional for a luxury car. Would definitely recommend this car. Tire monitor warning system saved me twice before tire went completely flat. Important since no spare tire was supplied.Hard top convertible great improvement over my SL600 removable hard top. Keyless entry and start another of this cars great options. This car will not go at all in ice or snow. Can't wait to try the new SL65 or SLR.
car_4868,I Love Mine,"I love my SL500. The performance is 
great and the style is very eye 
catching. I fell in love with it as 
soon as I saw it!
It's fun and comfortable to drive.
I don't like the fact that the tires 
can't be rotated. (the front are 
smaller than the back and they are also 
directional) I feel like the navigation 
CD's are lacking (my hometown is not 
even on them) So I feel like that was 
money wasted.
However, overall I still Love My SL!"
car_4869,The Best,"Truly fabulous automobile.  With the 
top down it is awesome!  There is no 
other convertible that I would consider 
in this price range."
car_4870,10,"The SL65 is a very reliable, fast, and 
is a joy to ride and drive. It has so 
much horsepower that as soon as you 
step on the gas you are flying. It is 
great."
car_4871,Your Personal Adrenalin Pump,"I wish it were 800 pounds lighter and 
$30K cheaper.  But mostly I wish this 
car had been on the market when I lived 
in the rolling hills of Connecticut 
instead of downtown Chicago.  My 
biggest problem with it has been the 
urge to rise at 5:00 a.m. on weekends 
to find a clear roadway worthy of its 
capabilities.  Cars (and I've had a lot 
of them) just don't get any more fun 
than this one.  A few -- very few -- 
beat it in handling or acceleration, 
but none beats it in cool quotient when 
you factor in the hard drop top which 
looks as good up as down.  Porsches are 
Mozart.  Bimmers are Mahler.  This car 
is Beethoven's 9th."
car_4872,Benz SL 500,"A very heavy German car. What is not to 
like about that?"
car_4873,Fun - Attitude and Style,"Only 650 miles thus far.  Have not 
pushed the car any but can tell that 
the performance is exceptional.  Can't 
wait to pass the break-in and really 
work it out.  An absolute pleasure to 
drive."
car_4874,Ferocious,"I have had the good fortune to own 
many very fast toys, but this car tops 
them all, including my 360 Ferrari. It 
is comfortable, quiet, elegant and 
ergonomically almost perfect. However, 
once you trounce the pedal it 
transforms itself into a raging beast. 
Cars going at freeway speeds are 
passed as if they were standing still 
and the acceleration keeps building 
and building. Its a little scary and I 
have track experience. In seconds you 
are at go to jail without stopping 
speed. The ultimate power trip."
car_4875,SL500. 10 Years Ahead of the Competition,"Everything about this car screams 
perfection. The only drawback is the 
amount of the check it takes to bring 
it home. She is sexy, yet bold. Her 
lines are timeless and forever. I have 
owned 6 cars that cost over $100k and 
this is by far my favorite."
car_4876,Awesome,"I am loving this car.  I have an older 
S500 sedan, but the precision with 
which this performs is awesome.  The 
top drops easily and it feels great to 
drive in any conditions I have met."
car_4877,Wow power,"The same advice they give jet pilots. 
When you pass another car be sure to be
thinking where you will be, not where
you are.  It is so fast and powerful
that unless you want to race a top
fueler at the local drag strip you don't
need more power or speed.
This car handles so well you have to
remember not to nod off thinking it is
driving itself.  Spending this kind of
money seems overkill until you drive and
drive and keep looking forward to
driving it again.  What a rush.  No
regrets and lets's face it, the looks on
the drivers of the ""Z's"" is precious as
they do a double and triple take while
eyeing the sparkling AMG on the stern.
Ever fishtail doing 70 and stomping on
it?  This does it!"
car_4878,love my car,"I was given my car as a HS grad gift. I 
am going to college now and it just so 
happens that I got a great garage park 
so I do not have to worry about 
my ""baby""!  Always cranks on 1st try , 
even if I've been cramming for exams 
and have not driven it for a day or 
two.  I don't mind the looks either!"
car_4879,LOVIN IT,"BEST car ever. For any single guy. 
Single girl. any one who like or knows 
about cars. This is a must have"
car_4880,Beautiful car flawed by engine noise,"Probably the best-looking car Mercedes 
has ever made. The retractable hardtop 
is fabulous and should be copied by all 
convertible car makers.  It is however 
seriously marred by two major flaws.  
The engine pings as if it is running on 
low-octane gas all the time.  (I use 
91 ). Going uphill with a passenger it 
sounds like diesel sometimes.  For a 
car this expensive, it ought to run 
much smoother than that. Spoils the 
otherwise perfect ride.  Mercedes 
tells  me they all do it, its not a 
repairable item. Also, the controls are 
very badly designed.  You better keep 
the manual with you at all times or be 
a computer engineer."
car_4881,My new baby,"I have owned my 2005 SL500 for 1 week 
now.  Traded in my 2002 M3 after its 
3rd recall.  Gave up some performance 
for a lot more comfort and luxury, not 
to mention that sweet drop top.  I 
have gotten 10x's the stares and 
comments in this than I ever did in 
the M3.  So far, I couldn't be happier 
with the trade.  Traffic is so dense 
these days, I couldn't use all the 
power the M3 had 90% of the time."
car_4882,"Torque, not HP","I have had a Jaguar and a Ferrari in 
the past, and driven the Porsches of 
friends.  I was attracted to the new 
Mercedes ""monster car"" because it 
broke the 600 HP barrier.  What I have 
found is that the HP understates the 
perfomance of the vehicle, if you can 
imagine that.  Between 2000 and 4000 
rpm there is well over 700 ft-lbs of 
torque and the driving experience is 
like nothing I have ever felt.  

Now, this is a heavy machine, and you 
can feel it.  But the ride is 
still ""tight"", the seats well designed 
to hold you, and the controls very 
accesible.  The interior touches are 
nice, but this is still an SL500 with 
a monster engine and monster brakes."
car_4883,great car,"great car over all, I love it."
car_4884,less than great,"I have owned my SL55 for just 9 months 
and have had 4 different problems 
requiring dealer service from the top 
not closing completely, to a failed 
electronic display module, et al.  I am 
disappointed at the low end torque - my 
2000 E55 was every bit as good.  
Cornering is far from ""Porsche like"" 
and the car is much too loud when you 
accelerate heavily.  As in all MB's  
the sound system is just OK. The whole 
package should be better for $125k 
large.  Killer looks and thats about 
it.  This is my 7th MB and likely my 
last."
car_4885,2004 SL55 AMG,"This car is the perfect sports car.  It 
handles extremely well, I average 18.5 
mpg. I have had no problems with this 
car."
car_4886,2005 SL55 AMG,"IT IS TOUGH TO KEEP THIS CAR UNDER 
100MPH THE SL55 AMG IS AN UNBELIEVABLE 
RIDE AND EXTRA POWER TO SPARE WITH ITS 
SUPERCHARGED 493 HP AND 516 LBS OF 
TORQUE. THIS VEHICLE NUDGES OUT THE 03-
04 VIPER STOCK ON THE TRACK BUT IS

car_4891,Terrific daily driver,"Feels luxurious and sporty at same time. Steering in Comfort mode with a little too much assistance, but very good in Sport and Sport+ modes.  Really enjoy driving this car. Have had the car for about 10 months and no problems. Would definitely get this car again."
car_4892,RATHER DRIVE A 12,"THE CAR RIDES VERY STIFF EVEN WITH ABC, IT FEELS LIKE ITS NOT ENGAGED, THE RIDE IN THE 2012 IS SUPERIOR THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT SUSPENSION I  PURCHASED A 2012 MUCH BETTER RIDE"
car_4893,Hard decision was the right decision,"There are lots of choices in today's marketplace for the person wanting a two seat sports roadster. I ordered my SL 450 on the day that the dealer was allowed to enter orders for the 2017 model year. The homework prior to selecting the SL 450 was many months of soul searching for the right car, and in the end my list of wants played a role in my final selection. I nixed many models and brands because of over budget price and worthiness to be classified as a luxury roadster. My final decision was made on a budgeted amount I was willing to spend,  overall styling, interior comfort, entry/exit, technology features, available options, ride quality, how well the engine was matched to the transmission, safety features, trunk space, outward visibility, and industry magazine articles. I have owned 1981 and 2001 Corvette's so I had that American experience behind me and fulfilled that past teenage desire to someday own a Corvette. As part of my research, I also considered and drove the Corvette Z51, the Jaguar F-Type, the Porsche Cayman S, and the Audi TT.  They all had entry/exit issues and trunk space issues, and only the Corvette passed the interior comfort, technology, and ride quality test. The final decision became easy because the Sl 450 met my expectations in a luxury Roadster based on the 2016 model year, and automotive journal comments about the 2017 which I found to be accurate. The motor transmission match-up is an absolute joy, and the motor has plenty of torque to make the driver feel that he/she is not being held back by torque lag. I bought the Brilliant Blue, with the Designo Sand interior and Black Ash Trim, and it is a beautiful classic look. It has every option except for the Automatic Body Control and the Upgrade Sound System. The improvements over the 2016 SL 400 made it easy to wait for the 2017 model year. If you want a car that gets lots of looks and thumbs-up, this car pretty much does that. There is enough trunk space with the top closed to satisfy a week trip worth of luggage. With the top down, and the windows/wind screen up, you can easily carry on a conversation at interstate speeds. I own a GL 550, so moving from one to the other is very easy because the controls are very similar. I had concerns about the small video screen, but it has not been an issue. The only thing I had issues with was learning how to pre-set stations for the radio, its awkward and more complicated than it should be, but great to use once the up-to 100 pre-sets are programmed. I would not spend the additional $20,000.00 for the SL 550 unless you have a personal need to have that emblem on your car. The more I drive this car, the more I want to drive this car."
car_4894,the best,"the best in the market cannot go wrong 
with this one , test drive it and you 
will fall in love with it nothing like 
it available."
car_4895,Fourth SL,"SL600 is the fourth SL Mercedes owned 
and positively the best vehicle"
car_4896,"Nice Ride, but then again it should be","I bought this car for the styling, and 
it is a beautiful and sexy car.  After 
driving it the past three weeks, I am 
happy with the overall features, 
comfort, and performance.  It is not an 
economy car obviously, so plan on 
spending some gas money.  Also the 
teleaid system seems pretty pricey 
($260 a year, plus minute usage fees) 
for emergencies in which the air bags 
deploy, or for a concierge service."
car_4897,Best Car I have ever owned,"This car is unbelieveable!!  When I was 
looking at purchasing a new car, I test 
drove this SL65, a Viper, and a 
maserati spyder.  This car, to me, was 
head and shoulders above all others.  
Unbelievable acceleration, wonderful 
sound, and unparalleled luxury.  Seats 
are very supportive, yet comfortable.  
If you can find one, buy it."
car_4898,Mercedes Flagship,"Faster than a ZO6, more luxurious than a
Roll's, and is built with quality that
made Mercedes famous.  This is the best
2 door roadster/coupe on the market, period."
car_4899,nice,"this is actually my favorite car now. i 
think many people love this car to as 
much as i do. it is nice comfortable 
and worth it."
car_4900,BUY IT!,"BEST CAR YOU WILL EVER OWN. I OWNED 
CORVETTES IN THE PAST UP UNTIL 2004 
WHEN I BOUGHT MY SL500. I KNOW ITS 
TWICE THE PRICE BUT ITS THREE TIMES THE 
QUALITY. BASE ENGINE IS QUICK BUT IF 
YOU WANT ALL OUT PERFORMANCE BUY THE 
SL600."
car_4901,AWESOME!!!,"I just bought the car and it is without 
a doubt, the most fun you can have on 
four wheels!  The performance and 
handling is phenomenal AND it's a 
hardtop convertible.  I get approached 
everyday and congratulated on my 
purchase.  This is a MUST have if you 
have the money!"
car_4902,Wheeeeeee,Fun in the sun.
car_4903,love it so far,"I traded my 2000 Jaguar XK8 in for this 
and hope to get better reliability.  So 
far so good.  I love the car except the 
navigation system is pretty much 
useless.  It doesn't even have my town 
in it.  I still have to keep my Garmin 
Street Pilot in the car."
car_4904,Absoloutely the best car I've ever had!,"This car is absolutely the best!  I have traded up 
from an '04 SL500 and I don't regret it one bit.  The 
performance and handling of this car is awesome!  
The shift by MB to DVD navigation is the right step!  
If you're looking for a roadster/convertible, this is 
IT!"
car_4905,SL500,Not for very tall or overweight folks
car_4906,Great vehicle!,"I drive 2000-3000 miles a month. I wanted  a comfortable, reliable vehicle that I can depend on. For only having this vehicle for 3 weeks, I think I made the correct decision.  Time will tell."

car_4909,2011 GX460 - Amazingly Inferior Sound System,"I listen to music occasionally, but do have a taste to distinguish between something that just makes sound vs something that sounds good. We just bought a new 2011 GX460, and unfortunately did not test the audio system using a standard quality recorded song before buying like my iPod or standard audio CD.Both my old sub 40k cars had fantastic music system compared to this. For the price we pay for this car, its amazing Lexus manages to get away with providing a third grade audio system. The sytem sounds horribly hollow or bassy at best, no matter how much you adjust the treble/mid/bass controls. I have complained to the dealer and they said they will give it a shot. Stay Tuned..."
car_4910,Avoid this truck,"Tested BMW x5, MDX, BM350 and RX350 and GX460 on local road, loved RX350 but went with Gx460 with regret not testing it on highway. Thought we will get roomier and more conformable ride than rx350 but got sea sick the first 50 miles driving it. This truck ride very bumpy and shakes on high way, it made us sick and dizzy (never had this problem). Be care if you have kids. Gas mileage is very poor not an ideal day to day car for the family, avoid it if you can. Traded in for a 2011 RX350 later and much happier now."
car_4911,A poor excuse for a Lexus,"This is my 3rd GX vehicle 05,08 and now a 10.  This vehicle with all the hype about how this one was suppose to be the best.  No power, very uncomfortable, when opening the door sounds very tinny and cheap.  On a trip, seats are very thin when compared to the 05 and 08.  Engine has no zip like previous models.  I strongly recommend someone to check these items prior to purchasing."
car_4912,SUV made us sick,"Avoid this truck-based SUV you if can. We tested drove GX470 were very happy with it. Bought this GX460 with regret not testing it on high-way. The dealer didn’t offer any help but a trade-in. The hash ride made us sea sick the first day! It bounces back and forth on local road and shakes on highway. The SUV feels solid same as the seat, they look good but are stiff. Love the NAV and interior color."
car_4913,Acceleration,I have had the same issued since the date of purchase.  From a stop when you accelerate the vehicle has a stall or hesitation for 2 or 3 seconds.  This does not occur every time thus creates a problem for Lexus.  I have complained to Lexus and gone through the hearing process which is a waste of time.  The representatives from Lexus and the hearing panel drove the vehicle across the street from the hotel and around the Costco parking lot and said the vehicle did not demonstrate a problem. The vehicle has a problem!
car_4914,Love my GX 460!,"I couldn't be happier!  Everything about the gx460  is luxury and it's rated the most reliable in it's class.  It's perfect!  My kids love it, I love it, and hubby always finds an excuse to drive it.  It's first class."
car_4915,Same problem,"I am having the same problem that the last person's review (Mr Sylvester). Sometimes, when I am in a stop light, and I want to accelerate quickly, the car does not responds right away for a few seconds and this yes! Could cause an accident. I thought it was normal, but now I know I am not the only one with this problem and I will take it to Lexus dealership"
car_4916,Lower back pain,"I have owned 5 SUVs and this one is the most luxurious.  I bought it thinking I would own it for several years.  Unfortunately, the seat and ride are causing lower back pain.  I even have the headrest turned backwards which looks ridiculous.  MRI showed a bulging disc so this is no joke."
car_4917,GX 460 review (already problems),"I like this vehicle, but there are problems with the acceleration after stopping and accelerating quickly. This is a safety problem if trying to accelerate quickly through an intersection, one can get into an accident. Lexus is addressing the issue, but do not believe this is safety issue because no accidents reported yet (although this is new + expensive vehicle).  If there was not this safety issue, I would say that the small area for 3rd row is an issue and leg room for drivers side.  It is build on 4runner chassis. The exterior and style look very nice. Just some fundamental issue"
car_4918,Very impressive fuel economy,"The 460GX is an extremely comfortable vehicle, at highway speed is very quite and you can easily do 23 mpg, at the same speed my FJ (6 cylinders) was maybe capable of 20 mpg and my former H3 (5 cylinders) 18 in a perfect day! The acceleration is to say the list impressive and off road is as good as an FJ. The third row is pretty comfortable, accordingly to my passengers, if the second row is moved forward. The GPS is excellent and I enjoy the ""air condition"" seats. I agree that the back swing door is not easy to use, specially in town, but you can now open the back window. Overall is an excellent vehicle at least for now, 2,500 miles in 40 days."
car_4919,SUV of 2010,"Traded in my 2006 GX470 for the new GX460 Premium (White/tan) on Aug 7, 2010.  The car has every option added, including the factory chrome wheels. Compared with my loaded GX470 it's by far better, smoother, comfortable and very quite on the highway.  I didn't have any problem with wind noise.  Other reviews had stated the wind noise problem but I didn't get it on my GX460 at all.  Highly recommended with Premium package because of all the convenience options that come with it.  Before buying this car, I test drove the X5, Porsche, Mercedes GL450, Escalade and Lincoln Navigator and then decide for yourself.  The GX460 drive it to believe it."
car_4920,Best SUV I ever had,"I got Base model with most options, couldn't be happier. So far only problem I have is either it needs wheel alignment or tires need air adjustment. It is quiet, luxurious and very comfortable. I am getting used to truck like feeling compared to BMW and Acura SUV I had before. My kids love this SUV."
car_4921,Great SUV with only two complaints,Great combination of luxury and utility.  Typical Lexus build quality and reliability.  Very comfortable ride particularly for a truck based SUV.  Not the most fun to drive (also typical Lexus).  My Acura MDX is much more sporty. Has just about every gadget/amenity you could ask for and some that you do not need (heated steering wheel?) Not a lot of cargo space for a midsized SUV.  Average to poor gas mileage for a vehicle of this size.  I also have noticed some issues with the engine suddenly revving up 1000 or so rpm when using the cruise control when heading uphill to try and maintain the speed.  Anyone else had this issue?
car_4922,3rd Lexus GX,"This luxury SUV is as advertised. Smooth ride, outstanding quality, safe and great projected resale value. Significant improvements on almost every element of the 2010 GX. Road manners are superb! Handling is very good for a larger SUV. Availability of color and model combinations is very limited."
car_4923,A Great SUV,"I previous had a '05 Lexus GX470 and find this SUV much improved in almost every way. I am completely satisfied with my ownership experience but find some of the plastics on the dash below Lexus standard. The engine is very smooth, quiet, and unexpectedly, this GX drives much sportier than the previous generation. I really enjoy the Bluetooth streaming audio and huge center console. Small details make this vehicle better every time I get in such as the whizzing motors of the windows/sunroof that slow to close and improved voice recognition software. I will most likely purchase another Lexus/Toyota product."
car_4924,Supper SUV,"What can I say, one of the best SUV from inside out. Anyone planning to purchase this, go ahead and do it. Don't be fooled by consumer report, one little thing they make it bigger. Lucky I am a first one got it on January 2010 and receive $500 off sticker window"
car_4925,Best SUV,"I usually don't write reviews, but this time I need to write one. I have had several suvs like Acura (had problems) mdx, Mercedes, and Audi (had problems), this Lexus gx is by far the best; very quiet, comfortable, smooth to drive etc. And sorry consumer report magazine, you won't stop people from buying the best quality cars ""Lexus"""
car_4926,Best Luxury SUV In its Class,"Purchased a 2010 Premium Edition with the rear DVD dual screens.  Awesome SUV, test drove BMW X5, Suburban, Escalade, Mercedes and in the end the LEXUS won.  Rear entertainment is definitely worth the price if you have kids, PlayStation hooks up very easily."
car_4927,Your only choice,I have had a GX 470 and sold it and special ordered a Premium GX 460 with every singel option available. I bought my GX on 4/29 with the software update and could not have asked for a better SUV.The fit and finish is superb and the GX is extremely quiet. I also drive a LS 460 and the sound system in the GX is very similar. I made a long distance trip to LA and back and got 22.5 mpg round trip at an average speed of 68 miles. the radar cruise control works excellent and HID's are excellent. If you need a world class SUV with features and comfort look no more get the GX 460
car_4928,Most Impressive,Great vehicle caught up in the politcal games against foreign owned companies.  Interesting how media underreports recent GM/Ford Recalls but over medias minor issue with a computer glitch that caused no damage or accidents.
car_4929,GX 460 Trumps,"I was in the market for about 3 months, I looked at the Escalade, rovers, bmw's and the whole gamut of luxury SUV and then i returned back to Lexus. I had an ES 350 that was wrecked by a bad driver so I set out to find what I needed and wanted. After driving all the option I fell in love with the Lexus GX 460. When i sat in the GX I said out loud, ""this is it"" only to seal the deal with a test drive. You might get another car that has more bling or another feature that you might want but you will never find a car that can take on the GX 460 in its entirety. This car drives like a sports car in sport mode with the tap shift and drives like a cloud when on comfort mode. I never looked back."
car_4930,Great Vehicle!,"I traded in my Lexus GX 470 and couldn't be happier.  Many small issues have been eliminated, by provision of bottle holders in the doors, folding mirrors for entering the garage, better console storage,better arm rests, fold down third row seats, supple leather, and vastly improved road noise reduction.  The interior is luxurious. The 460 has lots of power and a very smooth ride, much softer than the 470. Exterior styling is more Toyota than Lexus but still looks sharp. Agree that body side moldings could dress it up a little. It definitely has a rugged but luxurious feel to it."
car_4931,Lexus Finess at it's best!,"I test drove them all (Mercedes,BMW,Land Rover,etc) before purchasing my GX 460 hands down it is the best luxury SUV available today overall all things considered. The competition has its pluses but the GX 460 is the total package. With regard to the exterior styling it is not a Bling Mobile; the GX is the perfect vehicle for the “Stealthy Wealthy” all the good stuff is on the inside where it really counts Lexus knows who their customers are! Incredible ride (very close to LS 460 smoothness), stunning interior, extremely capable (more so then most will ever need) and out of this world easy to use technology. I love its relatively low key statue/styling; the standard sound system is amazing."
car_4932,Great Car With Some Minor Exceptions,"After reading the other reviews there isn't much to contribute other than I really am enjoying this car.  The only objection I have with it is that it doesn't come with the body side molding on the non- Premium edition.  I think it looks rather plain with out it, but I am currently researching how to get it.   The other minor objection I have is the amount of plastic used in the cockpit.....TOO MUCH.  It still has a very warm and inviting feeling, the instruments are well displayed and everything works great.  The plastic used in the armrest makes me think it will break soon.  Hopefully it will be covered under warranty if it does."
car_4933,A Man's Truck,"A luxury SUV that was designed for the guys instead of the wife. Guys...if you love driving a 4wd truck, but want all of the luxury of the best sedans but without feeling like it's for a suburban mom, this is the truck for you."
car_4934,Very Nice,"The interior is first class and the electronic features are sophisticated yet easy to use. The ride, handling, and power on this suv is incredible. An average sized person will be cramped in the 3rd row seat but there is more room in this suv than the other luxury midsize suv's. I'm not thrilled with the exterior design but I also didn't care much for the other models out there right now."
car_4935,Amazing!,"I had a lexus ES 350 and traded it in for the new GX.  Not kidding, this vehicle is quieter and smoother then my 07 ES.   The outside is starting to grow on me, but the interior is perfect.  I have been test driving and researching for over a year and came back to the comfort,reliability and luxery Lexus gives its customers for the price.  The 3rd row is pretty much useless however, with it folding down flat, its not an issue for me."
car_4936,Great Ride!,"Simply the smoothest riding SUV I have ever drove. The power is not out of this world but good enough, after all it is an SUV not a race car. Inside it is almost perfect with the normal Lexus luxury's and although the 3rd row could be larger, I love the fact that it electronically folds down. The Sepia leather color is simply stunning. Bottom line, I test drove an Audi Q7, a BMW X5, and an Acura MDX before purchasing the GX 460 and none of them even came close."
car_4937,Very good SUV,"Purchased this SUV a few weeks ago.  We probably are still breaking in the engine but currently the gas mileage is 13mpg.  Outstanding interior and exterior quality.  Feels sort of ""trucky"" with the engine growling to accelerate and reach speed, as well as the ride (bouncy)."
car_4938,Love it,"I have owned a few SUVs, but this has to be the best experience ever.  The ride is solid and smooth, the suspension is sporty without being too hard.  I average about 19MPG (incl. city driving) primarily because i pay attention to the ""eco"" mode on the dashboard which has affected my driving behavior (slower acceleration, etc).  It is fast and has quick acceleration. Occasionally in taking sharp turns at higher speeds, there is a sense of top- heaviness but no concern for roll- over."
car_4939,The best SUV,"I've had the SUV for less than a month now and purchased it sight unseen based on info from internet.  While there were negative comments posted in some pre-sale reviews, I find this SUV everything I've wanted in an SUV.  It gets up to speed easily like a regular automobile, handles well, extremely quiet, averaging 17 mpg, more than expected for a 5000+# vehicle and workmanship is exceptional.  So far, I haven't found anything to complain about."
car_4940,prefecto,"I was very skeptical about buying this car, mostly because of the exterior looks, but it grew on me and I just had to have it. It is absolutely THE BEST suv i have ever owned. I have owned land rovers, mercedes, bmws, and even a spyker crossover. they come close to the gx, but no cigar. It has excellent quality, i have driven it from Texas to Minnesota twice already, and not a single problem. There really is no competition out there for this beast."
car_4941,owner 94 sl500 just 3 month,"I own 4 used Mercedes before 190E, 300E,sl560 and 560sec about 3 month ago I  just bought 94 sl500 with 125k miles  this is my 5th used bezn  I really enjoy driving this one its fun and fast I just add a couple hundred dollar to the sound system ready for summer Well I still need to fix my convertible won't do with the automatic button its embarrassing me to do with manually."
car_4942,Die hard 4,"This is my 3rd MBZ, one of the best, I love it and I intend to keep it as long as I live. Has 210,000 miles now. Engine runs very quiet and smooth. The soft top just gave up. At the same time some electronic parts and sensers are started giving up. All the aging problems surfaced when we had 110 F temperature days this year. I know what the problem was and need to be fixed but the MBZ test unit never found the problem, the tester always reports as no issue, it is like taking the car in and getting back unfixed. Anyway I told the mechanic just change the part I pointed out and that was it. Runs like a champ, no more heat related malfanction. I want to get at least 300,000 miles life."
car_4943,Best Mercedes I have owned,"Since 1976 I have owned 8 Mercedes. The first was a 1976 450 SL and the latest being a 2005 E320. I currently own a 1994 SL500 as well and really love it. It is the best car I have had to date. It current has a bit over 125,000 miles on it and the only thing I have had to do to it was rebuild the transmission and replace the soft top. The engine still has a lot of get up and go. It is not as strong as the new SL's (2004 as an example). It probably needs some tender loving care.  Of the 70's 90's and newest body styles I really like this body style (129) the best. It has class and character. I would really would recommend this car to anyone."
car_4944,1994 500SL Hard and Convert,"Bought the car 6 years old. Upgraded to AMG 15"" wheels and $800/rim alloy 3 piece. Low profile tires. This car is a dream. Very quiet with hard top off and can hear all Bose system. Corners like my Porsche did. Great service when needed.(not one major part in 5 yrs). Have spinal problems and yet can drive all day. Lot of punch. Best of 5 Mercedes I have owned. Others were sedans. Love the lines of this vintage. It is why I looked 3 years till the right one appeared. Take care of it and it takes care of you. 6 miles of gravel road/day and not one squeak yet. Can't say that for other brands I own for seconds. Stored in winter so no comment on winter handling."
car_4945,1994 Mercedes-Benz SL - The Greatest,"I have owned my 1994 Mercedes-Benz SL for three years. If you do the maintenance required every 15,000 miles and change the oil every 3,000 miles all you need to do is put tires and brakes on it.  It is the most reliable car that I have ever had. I can't get over the fact that it is ten years old and still turns heads."

car_4952,"Luxury Coupe, Super Car, Highway/Boulevard Cruiser","Bought my 2006 in 2016 for $25,000, hence my giving it 4 stars for value.  Didn't give 5 b/c it ain't cheap to fix!  But gawd almighty, the thing is built like a tank, drop-dead gorgeous, and can goes like a bat outta heck-on-fire!!!  And, even at 4,000 pounds, it take curves like a top-notch sports car and yet rides like a dream.  Even at 11 years old, the car has reasonably up to date technology like the Keyless Go system and parking sensors to name a couple.  No bluetooth or USB, but I couldn't care less about all that.  When I am behind the wheel of this beautiful beast, that;s all I need for entertainment - - and I'm not taking calls while I'm savoring my SL55!  Of course this review is written from the perspective of the car being my plaything, not a daily driver.   By the way, even if the maintenance is high, where else can you find a beautiful, $130,000 German super-luxo-coupe for under $25,000?  And even if it costs a couple or three thousand - or even five - to keep in top shape and gremlins away each year, the cost to own something this special for a few years is quite low relative to what you are driving."
car_4953,Purchaser of Used 2006 SL55 AMG,"Buying this car at 10 years old is a bargain among bargains.  Having been overbuilt in every way by M-B, then made even better by AMG, I honestly can't believe I am driving a car of this caliber.  And besides all that, it is an absolute joy to drive.  The SL55 is a high-end muscle car, its a gorgeous, top-end sporster/roadster, and its a highway blaster like no other.  (Think mind-bending acceleration and V8 sounds of a modern Mustang or Camaro, but the build and technology of a top-end German masterpiece).   I truly cherish every moment behind the wheel of this beautiful automobile.  As for some of the down comments posted here, I would say ""lack of instruments"" is part of this car's wonderment, not a downside.  For example, last night I received a ""please add one quart of crankcase oil"" instruction on the dash readout.  And so I will, today.  If there is a problem, this car knows it and tells the driver before it needs to be determined by symptoms or gauges.  This is my ""fun car"" and not a daily driver, although I have already driven it 6,000 care-free miles in 9 months.  I do hear of service issues and the previous owner of this one shows some of them in his thorough records, but I've been most fortunate to have nothing more than a tire go flat (nothing to do with the car).   Aside from a quart of oil, I'm hoping to make it to the ten thousand mile service before anything goes wrong.   PLEASE NOTE (as I have):  When you buy a car of this caliber (remember, this is the SL55 AMG (not the SL500), its not going to be cheap to maintain.  Despite its classy lines and luxury feel, THE SL55 AMG IS A SUPERCAR.  The only difference here is that most folks drive these as every day drivers and are surprised when service costs are high.  Despite its feel of being a great every-day-er, its far beyond that.  I would suggest the SL500 if you want an amazing every day car.  Less issues likely, and do you really need to get to 60 MPH in under 5 seconds?   Me... I love the beautiful sound of that AMG motor and the overall AMG tuning.  I got in for cheap, so some higher maintenance costs will be okay by me if they keep it on the road.  I built them into the budget :)"
car_4954,Very Disappointing,"Although I love the looks of the car both inside and out, it lacks many things. The handling and horsepower to weight ratio are disappointing. My Corvette Z06 will run circles around this car. Many of the controls are hard to use and antiquated.  A true sport car should have full instrumentation, not idiot lights. It also has very high maintenance costs and small petty things that make it a regular at the service department.  You would think Mercedes could afford to include maintenance costs for what you pay. They also lose half their value in just a few years, so that is another thing for some to consider. It is a pleasant enough Sunday cruiser but for the money it is very disappointing."
car_4955,Wish I Hadn't Leased It!,"Great car! Comfortable, smooth, quick and gorgeous. Prior MB was an AMG SLK. Faster than the SL but not nearly as comfortable or luxurious. We leased the SL and wish we'd bought it. The 39 month lease is up this year and the purchase option is outrageous. Don't like the looks of the '09 nearly as well as the '03 through the '08. About the only thing we don't like (other than a very poor radio and non-intuitive controls) is the cost of routine maintenance. For the price of this car MB should include routine maintenance as BMW/Audi do. We're hoping the '10 model returns to the more classic style of the '03-'08. If so, we'll buy one this time."
car_4956,It's not inexpensive but it's very nice,I wanted an SL when they changed the body-style in '03. This has that classic design and style. You can't help but admire it and there are no shortages of folks who tell you that!
car_4957,Fun in the Sun,"This car is an absolute joy to drive. It's like having 3 cars in one...luxury, sports, and convertible. I couldn't ask for a car that is capable in all 3 areas."
car_4958,"Performance, Luxury, Muscle Car all in one","My SL55 has been the car I always wanted. It outperforms the 2 year old Porshe I turned, in all catagories. It is faster, corners better and much more comfortable. The hard top convertible gives you a quiet ride when up.I have had a few minor electronic problems that were fixed quickly I have the SL 65 sport package on mine. It is the same car as an SL65 without the extra 800 pounds in the motor and only 111 less H.P. This is the best production sports,luxury,Muscle car on the road. The downside, They charge you for all 3 cars.It beats almost everything. If you can afford a $145,000 car, This is the best car on the road."
car_4959,A great step up,"I held off on all Mercedes until I saw the 2003 SL500, which I bought and enjoyed immensely. My only complaint was that I felt that for this level of car, and for it's weight, it was a little underpowered. I test drove the new SL550, which substantially improved the engine power problem with the improved torque and horsepower. I had the opportunity, however, to purchase a new 2006 SL65, and the difference is again night and day. I love the instant power without any significant turbo lag, and yet the elegant and sophisticated luxury package in which this beast is housed. Though much more subtle in appearance than some comparables, the car demands one's attention. Performance is superb."
car_4960,Fun in Chicago,"Great riding car. Extremely quiet and yet fast as hell. Best on the open road. However, for slower driving the SL55 was more fun to drive in city traffic."
car_4961,SL600 - Yes!,"Fun, fun, fun to drive. Good handling, nice looking. it gets lots of looks. A true, comfortable, sports car."
car_4962,"Yea, it is fun","This is my third SL. Yes, they are fun, and expensive. I like the retractable roof. So much better than lifting the other hard tops off.  After spending nearly $90K for this car to have me pay for regular maintance is a joke.  Really irks me and thus this will probably be last Benz."
car_4963,Adds zest to my commute,"The SL55 puts track performance and handing capabilities into a comfortable street legal vehicle. That would be difficult to improve upon.  I have owned other more exotic sports cars, some at twice the price, and the SL55 is the best to date.  Anyone considering the SL65 should go to the SL55 instead. The added 800 pounds up front in the SL65  has a huge negative impact on handing, which is why the SL55 consistently beats on US and European tracks."
car_4964,Loads of fun drive,Great car. Lots of fun to drive. No major problems with the car though have had a good number of small items.
car_4965,Nice.,"I got the 2006 SL500 in Feb 2006. I am really a Jaguar person, having owned three so far, but at the time Jaguar would not even quote a price for the new XK, and I was able to get a good deal on the Mercedes. Well, the car is nice, but certainly not thrilling. Perhaps the SL55 would have been better for me. I consider the wonderful 7 speed automatic transmission to be the car's forte. It seems to be just in the right gear at all times. I keep the transmission setting in ""sport"" mode. The AMG package with the steering wheel paddles is a nice touch and I like the optional panorama roof. I must say, no car I have ever owned has attracted so much interest. My clients always ask how I enjoy it."
car_4966,Best Luxury Roadster/Boulevardier,"Pro: Best car I ever owned. Real head turner. Myriad positive comments. Quiet, smooth ride. Solid body: no squeaks, rattles, groans, shakes, or shudders. Awesome, smooth power with great engine sound. I never brake for corners. Good trunk space. Cons: should come with all-season tires, not summer. Bose sound system mediocre: not much volume or bass. Lots of interior wood-trim not in-cluded and absurdly expensive on the aftermarket. No door- ding strips- standard on C class.  Headlight and taillight trim rings are not included. Grille and louver fins painted grey instead of chrome plated. No chrome trim on bumpers. Wheels are painted instead of plated."
car_4967,One of the greatest cars ever!,"I purchased this car in pewter with ash interior. The wheels are awsome, they are graphite with bolts surrouding. The tailamps are darkened as a standard feature, and 65 AMG body kits are great. The 600+ hp is wicked, and when starting up you might want to tell the neighbors in case there sleeping. The navigation is so easy! Buttons are at an easy reach and long drives dont make you feel numb and the need to stretch is unheard of. The folding top lets you hear the 600+ hp noise even better, especially when excellerating at low speeds. 180k + price list but my gosh its worth every penny!"
car_4968,The Best SL Yet,"This is the third SL I have owned, having purchased new a 1986 and a 1996 now my 2006, which by the way I still own all three. All three cars are completely different, However the 2006 is by far my favorite. It has all the features I need and more. I love being able to have a hardtop with the convertable ability. The 2 previous cars were a little difficult at times. I had to park the hardtop for the summer with a 2 person process of on or off. The look is beautiful. I have to say though all three are beautiful."
car_4969,Awesome!,I think that this car has amazing power and handiling.  It holds the road like no other! the power top is amazing! Must Buy!
car_4970,Outstanding Mercedes,My father bought this car and I simply fell in love with it. The interior design is just beautiful and the exterior is head turning gorgeous.
car_4971,Nice but still unreliable,"To purchase a 100+k car, you would think that it would be devoid of cheap plastics.  Think again.  I'm also  hearing fluctuations in the engine idle already, and I haven't broken 7K miles yet. Yes, it's still the status symbol to have, but one that is not as well put together as I'd hoped.  I'm going back to the SC430 before I take an even bigger hit with depreciation.  If I listen quietly enough, I can hear the dollar bills dripping under the car."
car_4972,"Elegant Car, Timeless Styling",Besides the world class styling this car is also so smooth and powerful.  The 302 hp engine and 7 speed automatic tranmission effortlessly propels the car down the road with such authority and grace.   The convertible top works as advertised - a smooth mechanical ballet that takes you from quiet hardtop coupe to convertible in 16 seconds.  The exterior and interior finish are well done and the entire feel of the car seems so tight and  well engineered.  The navigation system is easy to use and has a points of interest function that is very handy.  The 2006 model year includes Sirius satellite radio as a no charge option and I'm finding it to be a real bonus - incredible amount of choice.
car_4973,Acceleration with music,"The machine's near 500 horsepower combined with its sophisticated sound system (with Sirius radio)means that you never have to go home, if you don't want to."
car_4974,Supercar for Corolla Money!!,"Just purchased my 5th SL and might be the best. Full option 2002 model with 152000 kms and appears tight as a drum. The FSH and one lady owner might help, plus she never lowered the roof during ownership!! Love the Radar Cruise and cooled seats here in Dubai, had 2 Sl55's 02 and 04, but felt they always wanted to blast down the road and noisy. Loved them but never in love with them. I think for just short of £7000, there is nothing better to play in the Sun.... Everything works, except the Pulse seats (common fault ) will see what the dealer estimates next week, but was not a deal breaker. You need to have it inspected, especially the hydraulic susphension before you buy as I did."
car_4975,Mercedes dropped the ball,"I bought my 2002 Silver arrow after I read very positive reviews here. It had 98000 miles on it, Everything you read here about the car being fun, powerfull, great looking is correct, butMan as fa as body goes no engineering work has been done. the plastic handle on emergency break broke, the button, and the handle on console brok, the button on storage net broke, just about everything you touchhas broken, or breaks first time I touch, the signal light lense just fell off, MB insignia broke lose, the jak hole cover just fell off, and the insignificant piece is $211 only available at dealer. Car vibrates at speed over 60, tires are new and balanced, known issue. I do not recommend buying."
car_4976,Excellent & Fun,"I have owned numerous convertibles. This one is no sports car but is a superb touring open car. It is fast, fun, comfortable, and a joy to ride in the hill country of Texas. It is not great on snow or ice. Mine is a silver Arrow and is exceptional. It weighs as much as my Suburban but is a lot more fun to drive.  If you can find one get it and enjoy the ride"
car_4977,"""Silver Arrow"", as good as it gets","I recently bought a 2002 ""Silver Arrow"" with only 16,500 miles on it and I am absolutely delighted! The car is all I could ever hope for and has the feeling that only a well built ,heavy roadster can provide to it's driver. I drove several SL's before deciding on the ""Silver Arrow"" and although all of them were excellent,the ""Arrow"" just plainly had them all beat in the looks department. The interior appointments and special features made me appreciate all the more, the quality of such a wonderful vehicle.A nyone wishing to purchase a quality SL would do well to look into the ""Silver Arrow"" version, I know they will not be disappointed, I certainly wasn't !"
car_4978,Best SL I Have Ever Owned,"This is my third SL roadster and is 
absolutely the finest.  It is a 
2002 SL500 Special Limited 
Edition ""Silver Arrow"" with special 
silver ultra-metalic paint,special six 
spoke 18-inch alloy wheels and an 
interior with two-tone 
silver and black NAPA leather with 
black bird's eye maple wood trim.  
With this interior you know you are 
sitting in the most exquisite roadster 
in the world.  Best of all the SL 
performance is flawless.  When this 
car is delivered to you it is 
perfection.  The 5.0-liter V8 is 
smooth and powerful.  I had the 
opportunity to order a 2003 SL500 
instead of buying my 2002, but I still 
love my Silver Arrow."
car_4979,200 SL500 Silver Arrow - last handbuilt,"I've had this car for almost one year 
and with 5K miles, not a single 
problem. From what I understand this is 
one of the last mostly hand-assembled 
models of it's class. I like the new 
2003 style, but my 2002 Silver Arrow is 
a classic car and I love it."
car_4980,Timeless Classic...,"My Mercedes is a 1992 500SL with the 
326bhp 32v DOHC V8! This is the most 
powerful ""Non induction"" V8 Mercedes 
has ever made.....and that includes 
the new model! My Car is faultless, it 
has nearly every extra available at 
that time fitted on the car and every 
single button, light, switch, leaver 
works perfectly!  The build quality of 
these earlier cars were at their best. 
As often said over engineered! The car 
has covered 92,000 miles and drives 
like new. Unlike the later cars there 
is no scuttle shake and no creaks from 
the amazingly well made interior. To 
finish off, the vehicle has big fat 18 
inch AMG wheels. It looks the biz..."
car_4981,Covertible Perfection,"This is the best and last of the ""true"" Mercedes Benz. Next model will have ""Daimler-Chrysler"" on the mfgr's plate. This car's got all the speed you would want, and with the sport pkg, it's handling limits are high enough to go play on mountain roads. Add a sweet sound system and armour like but comfy seats, and you've got the best two seat transportation available."
car_4982,Lexus For Life,"Bought 2012 white with sepia leather and could not be happier.I owned a 2012 4runner for a year prior and upgraded to the GX...there is no comparison between the two vehicles...the Lexus is superior in every way...baffled how others say they are the same vehicles!Mine came with the F-Sport package with upgraded rims.Totally changed the look of the GX.Very rare option that sets the SUV apart from others.Interior is top notch but that is what Lexus does.Smooth as butter ride, decent acceleration for a heavy SUV.Main reason bought is for the reliability..Bulletproof...Benz, BMW, Audi...all will be in shop with expensive repairs..enough said..."
car_4983,No surprises!!! it's a LEXUS!!!!!,"This is my second lexus and when you buy a Lexus, you get the best !!!!!!! excellent finish,reliability,smooth."
car_4984,Love this car!,"We've had this Lexus for around a year now and it's been great! Very reliable, and nice styling. We chose this over the 4Runner because of more luxury options and better exterior styling. I wish we had the second row captain's chairs, but that's only on higher trims. It's overall a very nice car. We've taken it on a long road trip and it was great. Rear entertainment is a great feature, too. You can't go wrong!"
car_4985,What an expensive mistake!!,"I use my 2016 Lexus GX 460 all day every day and I am reminded of how much I regret my purchase. My only consolation is the smooth ride and it ends there. The GPS is not accurate, telling you ""you have arrived"" if you are in the vicinity. I do not expect the GPS to drop me off at the exact location, but at least bring me to the right street. Also when you are ""close enough"" in their opinion, it tells you to ""look at the the map"". I am not new to GPS cars and this is the worst I've ever used. Even the Ford Focus car rental GPS is way better. I find myself using my phone to navigate which is counter productive considering I supposedly have a GPS in the car. Another concern is you have to press the screen 4x to just get air conditioning, adjust the amount of air, or change direction of air. This is a hazard when driving. The Apps also do not work. I cannot even use the Pandora and always get a ""tether error."" How can Lexus make electronics so complicated than what they should be?  Their engineers should test drive and use their electronics to experience the pain of using it. Horrible!!!!!"
car_4986,Lexus still can't get technology and support down!,"This is my 2nd GX 460. I love how it drives and handles. When my 2012 came off lease I went to another brand because Lexus was not keeping up with the technology such as remote start, adaptable cruise control, integration with smart phones... But shortly after getting my wife her 5th RX I checked out the advances in the 2017 GX technology and appeared they'd done a good job catching up, so I pulled the pin on a 2017 in Dec 2016 and everything was great until March. I've got Lexus Technology Support on ""speed dial"" I've talked to them so much. Enform remote just refuses to work. Started out as ""system upgrade issue"" and went down hill from there. Three times I've been told that they have to ""create a special ticket to resolve my issue and someone will contact me in 24-48 hrs"". NEVER HAPPENED! Even the local dealer tech guy has been frustrated in trying to help me out. You would think that a company that builds great cars, has great dealers (I've bought 7 Lexus's since 2000), would be able to roll out a technology upgrade without screwing it up. Check out the user reviews at http://lexus-enform-app-suite.appstor.io/app-reviews."
car_4987,Reliability and Comfort,"The GX is a bargain.  It's extremely comfortable to drive and it holds the road better than any SUV I've driven. It's quiet and comfortable yet it's powerful and agile. There's not a better deal out there.  The car is very safe to drive.  The cross traffic warning and large rear view camera come in handy when parking, backing up, and maneuvering in close spaces.  This is my second GX and I have yet to experience a quality issue or have need of a repair.  It's quiet and handles poor road conditions very well."
car_4988,Get one before they are gone for good.,"i have owned many Toyota and Lexus products through out the years and they have all been great. This is my first GX. What a truck! It's luxury meets old school solid off road warrior. I lease my cars and got a Lease quote on a 4 Runner with the TRD package, which I loved, but it's not the type truck you can take to an opera, plus the lease program was not so great. Then I looked at the 2017 GX 460 base model Black exterior with Sepia Nu Lux imitation leather interior and all the 4x4 goods that come on this truck. I was amazed how great it drove and just how old school it still felt, but in a good way. This thing is a true off roader and it's based more on the Land Cruiser Prado than the 4 runner. With driverless cars and the electric vehicles being the desired way of the future. I can't imagine this rough and Tough Lexus being made available to much longer and replaced with something more trendy. For us 4x4 truck lovers. Now is the time to grab a 4Runner, GX, land cruiser before they are gone just like the FJ. I love my GX because it's everything the 4Runner is and much more. Will be buying mine at the end of the lease which is fortunately my option to do so, plus the resale value is so good it's truly a no brainer."
car_4989,New GX 460,"Bought this car after driving 4Runners for 25 years. Considered it to be more luxurious version of my previous cars. Finding so many features I don't like: needs hi-test gas, poor gas mileage, poor interior design (cup holders in awkward posituon, less accessible places for change etc), awkward side-opening back door (does not protect me from rain, awkward loading large packaged)."
car_4990,Bulletproof reliability - but terrible otherwise,"This SUV is built like a tank with reliability, durability and longevity second to none. The interior is nicely done and of course its off road prowess is also second to none. The ride is also surprisingly comfortable and absorbent for a true body-on-frame SUV designed to tackle some really tough terrain. Sadly that is where the positives end. The GX masquerades as a ""luxury"" vehicle when it is not luxurious in the least. There is more to a luxury vehicle than putting some leather and some fancy gadgets inside. The GX has one of the ABSOLUTE WORST powertrains there is. The engine is simply horrendous! It is EXTREMELY noisy, sounding like a vacuum-cleaner on the slightest of grades. Even on the freeway at about 60 to 70 mph the exhaust drone gets very tiring after a while. Pretty shocking for so called ""luxury"" vehicle. The engine is also not the smoothest and pretty bad actually for a V8. There are some on here that have stated that this vehicle is ""extremely quiet"". These folks are likely certifiably DEAF if they can't here the constant droning from the engine, which is the worst from around 1800 RPM to around 2600 RPM. That was an absolute deal breaker for me, and it is why I got rid of mine, even though this was a very difficult decision, as I do consider reliability as one the top most important aspects of  a vehicle. In short, I do not recommend this vehicle at all. If it were a bare bones vehicle it would probably be OK, but for a high end luxury vehicle it is a joke!"
car_4991,A tank,"I don't get this. Why is this truck not getting 5 stars in every review .  I traded a 2014 VW Touareg TDI for the Lexus. I got tired of the running that the dealer give me. ( Is normal  is a German car, is build for performance). Well, in my eyes , the most important thing is to get me where i want to go without having to call a tow truck. Lexus , please don't pay attention to all these spring journalist that think , they know what and how a truck should perform. Please keep making this truck the way it is. I would  love to have that 2.8 diesel engine that is been sold everywhere around the world but <<<<  for now i will settle for this silk smooth 4.6 engine . Maybe a little turbo ??? next generation ?? in about four years  ."
car_4992,GX is great again,"This is our third GX.  Our '04 GX 470 had almost 200k miles.  It's cooling pipe went bust on the freeway, by the time we pulled to the next exit it over heated.  It ran another 6 months afterwards before we sold it to CarMax.  We bought the new '15 GX and it was totaled a month later after being rear ended by a careless driver.  The frame buckled and the rear bumper had the guys front end imprinted on it.  I was able to walk away with only a stiff neck.. the other driver had a fractured jaw, broken arm and leg and ribs.  The GX saved my live.  We bought our third GX a few weeks later.  This is a heavy traditional SUV, the acceleration is measured and ""stately"".  Fuel economy is in the high teens, not bad for this type of vehicle.  Handling is good if you get used to the truckiness.  On the freeway, it is stable and quiet.  It's not the quickest, but it does get to 80 to 90 mph before you know it.  The only complains I have is the poor placement of the two USB ports in the center console.  When plugged in, the sliding hatch cover have to be open.  And there are no power ports for the 2'nd row.  It got a little irritation having to charge the Kids' ipads on long trips.  The Lexus roof rack cross bars are nice looking, however, they sit too close to the roof making tying down cargo a bit difficult.  also you need a Torx key to move them.  I liked the old GX's roof rack, with plenty of tie in points to strap your cargo.Update, we got side swiped by some guy in a beat up 300.  We must be cursed in our GX!  The damage was extensive, from the front bumper to the back bumper.  The wife barely felt the impact, another testament to the safety of this truck.  Luckily only body damage sustained.  6 weeks and $13000 later, the truck was fixed with new bumper, fenders, doors, side step.  The only new gripe I have is the stock tires worn out faster than the tire warranty, and the ride is noticeably harsher than before.  We will be getting new meats for the truck soon."
car_4993,This Is My Second Lexus GX,"Drove a 2006 Lexus GX for 10 years and 130,000 miles. Not one problem from the day I drove it off the dealer's lot. In August 2016 I purchased a new 2016 GX 460.  It is a solid car; extremely quiet and the workmanship is high quality. Very pleased with it. I looked a numerous SUVs ( not crossovers ) and kept coming back to the Lexus GX. For the money it is a good value. Anticipate driving this one for another 10 years."
car_4994,2016 GX460,"This is the SUV, not crossover or anything like the BMW X5 or Acura MDX. It drives like a true SUV should be. I have less then 1000 miles on it. I consider it as a full size and luxury type of the Toyota FJ curser. Which is the go everywhere kind of vehicle. I am very happy with the vehicle."
car_4995,Expedition Downsizing / Follow-up review,"We have been a Ford Expedition family for years and they served us well hauling boats, kids to sporting events, vacations, moving, weddings etc. We were looking for a new expedition and noticed that the power options were limited to 6cyl eco boost. Apparently Ford decided to do away with 5.4 V8. Too bad. We looked at all of the other domestic Suv's and nothing really hit us. By chance we stopped into the Lexus dealership and noticed the GX460.Granted it's not as big as the Expedition but the kids are all married.  The ride is firm solid yet refined and in, many ways better that my exp. Fit n finish  is excellent . The overall driving experience is second to none. Acceleration is strong and reliable.We still tow the Whaler and it does it with ease and I have no regrets. After 1000miles we re getting 21.8mpg combined while getting 23 highway. We have not seen or experienced the concerns/issues of prior reviewers. It's an excellent Truck! Since the initial review we now have 3 K miles and it just keeps getting better. Driving in bad weather and snow/ice doesn't phase the GX one bit. Really unbelievable traction and no slip whatsoever in some major snow and ice conditions. The most solid and sure footed truck I have ever driven  even without haveing to lock it into 4WD. Much better than the expedition ever thought of being. Fit and finish still great no vibrations or unexplained noise or rattles. Most solid truck I have ever had while still being a refined ride.We now have over 6k miles on the Lexus and it drives as good as it did the day we drove it home. My previous comments regarding fit, finish, perfprmance and overall quality are still on point with no degridation what so ever. Truly the best truck ever, exceeding our expectations . Much better than the expedition ever was. To be truthful though I do on rare occasions miss the extra space of the Expedition but not enough to make me go back to one. I just hook up the utility trailer.No regrets."
car_4996,Best most comfortable suv,It is very comfortable and quiet.
car_4997,My 1st Lexus,"I love this car! For all the complaints listed in the Edmunds rating, I'm not finding them to be true. I will definitely be buying another in the future."
car_4998,Loooooooove!!!,"Just traded in my 2013 RX for the 2016 GX, which is what I should have gotten in the first place instead of the RX.  Can't say enough about how much I love it.  Great ride -- feels much more substantial than the RX (although the RX was great), and has all the features I need.  Yes, the new remodeled RXs definitely have more bells and whistles but the GX is fantastic!"
car_4999,GREAT BUY!!!,I love the buy and my only knock is that you have to get the lux package for the optional rear entertainment package.
car_5000,One great Lexus,You cannot go wrong buying the Lexus GX 460 premium
