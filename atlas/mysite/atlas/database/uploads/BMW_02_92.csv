bmw1111,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I contacted Shell UK and asked the following question:

I read that Shell UK are teaming up with another organisation who will be installing rapid charge points for electric vehicles in a number of service stations. As an electric vehicle owner and driver I think this is a great idea. Are you able to put any timescale on when I might be able to confidently drive my electric vehicle and know for certain that the majority of Shell UK petrol stations have a working charge point available for me to use?

Their reply was:
Thank you for writing to Shell and we appreciate the opportunity to address your concern.

We will be rolling out 50kw charge posts at selected Shell stations starting September 2017. These chargers will be compatible with all EV charging connections and we will be able to roll out 10 by the end of the year.

Should you have any other concerns, please do not hesitate to email us back.

Once again thank you for contacting Shell UK.

bmw1115,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"Thank them and ask if that have a list of which those 10 stations will be.  Then you can share so others can plan around them too

Putting in a charger, especially a high current one, can cost a lot more than just the post,  especially if they have to upgrade electrical service to accommodate it.  They probably picked the 10 cheapest stations to install chargers at, not the 10 that get them the best coverage.

bmw1116,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"Can you also point out that 50kW is really behind the curve now. There are 100kW capable EVs and chargers, so it would be bonkers to install 50kW. Old tech.

You can say if they did put in 100kW then that would become a serious option for drivers who could stop for just 12 minutes charge (as long as it takes me to wait for a liquefied dinosaur pump sometimes!) and receive 100 EV miles of charge (in the situation that they could reach the 100kW rate - as we know it is variable).

That is a seriously useful charge rate, and more importantly...... the faster they charge, the more customers they can get through!

I'd send that myself, but I got an incredibly bad bit of treatment at a 'franchise' shell garage a year or so ago and vowed never to use them again. If I wrote, then my email would be interspersed with a series of unconstructive derogatory comments. e.g. I'd ask them when they are going to take EV charging seriously, rather than cynically going for a bit of press coverage.

I am still sceptical that the leopard won't change it's spots. They will install a few to make it look like they are embracing the future, but IMO do all they can to slow it down and push PHEVs (and hydrogen?) as the solution.

50kW chargers make perfect sense as highlights how much quicker it is to fill up using fossil fuel. One rapid per site so if it doesn't work or is already in use they can highlight how much more convenient fossil fuel is, as even a busy pump is soon free again.

We 'just' need about 5% of cars used for long trips to be EVs (and not Teslas) for the free market to really start working for charging.   These EVs can be like the BMW i3, as it is cheaper to charge then put petrol in, hence generates demand for chargers.

Shell don't make any significant money at the retail side, mostly they are trying to cover costs and they don't actually run a lot of the sites themselves. Like most big oil, they have been selling off the sites to consortiums that want to develop the retail side.  

Shell's profit is made on of the wholesale price of fuel and other fossil fuel activities. There really isn't any money to be made by Shell selling EV charging and clearly making hydrogen from fossil fuels is far more profitable for them.

It would be really great to get that sort of speed from low SOC, once I can actually find such chargers.

Happy to pay £3 + kWh for that, but even a full 50kW would work well.

This is really what we need, 10 minute 'pit stops' that take little longer than a regular fuel-fill. 10 mins at 100kW should be worth ~60 miles. If we can get that sort of through-put on EV charging then there is really no need to resort to a huge battery if you are doing less than a few hundred miles.

It may be useful in winter if I need a few kWh.

bmw1180,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"If there is one at every station, I could actually see them fairly actively used. 

For example, you ask your passenger 'I've got 20kWh to make it 80 miles? Will I make it?', passenger replies 'don't worry, just drop into the shell on the edge of town and top up a couple of kWh if you look too low to get all the way home'.

As a back-up facility for those last few miles, it could be a total god-send. With people topping up for just 5 minutes at a time (say 4kWh = £2) they could have a steady stream of gone-out-of-towners chancing their arm and misjudging it just a touch.

That would be ideal to cover trips where a tricky distance between planned Rapids is seen. A ten minute stop to load 5kWhs, and only cost £2.50, would buy you 20 miles of safety net.

I'd be pleasantly surprised if they did allow payment for EV charging at-the-till, but I doubt they will.

You are partly correct about gasoline.  American use of gasoline to describe a motor fuel post dates petrol by a few months.     However the origin may be British.
 

1895    New Rev. Oct. 392   Of the petroleum vehicle..it may be said that it owes much of its extreme lightness to its modesty in the matter of fuel. A few pints of gasolene or rectified petroleum will suffice it for five or six hours.Click to expand...
	
Ah, that reminds me of the story I heard.

This was that someone in the States was selling similar stuff under the 'passing-off' eponymous name of 'casoline', as painted on his cans of said product. Mr Cassell complained and US customs was dispatched to said warehouse of counterfeit stock. Having been tipped off to this, the perpetrator added the embellishment which changed the 'c' to a 'g', which was the quickest way to avoid a confrontation with the law.

The name then stuck there, as given by an American fraudster.

(I expect that from memory I might be adding embellishments myself, but in the world of illogical neuro-typicals, better to make up a good story than stick to facts, it only confuses them.)

The scientific name for petrol is 'octane' as the modal molecule contains 8 carbon atoms, but there are additional hydrocarbons, longer and shorter, and a soup of other stuff. So trade names apply to the particular recipes.

I was lucky enough to have a drive in a Mirai at the recent LCV event. It's quite a nice smooth drive, but round the Alpine circuit felt underpowered, wallowy on the handling and not great braking characteristics. It did seem very quiet at high speed on the bowl but I know from past experience that's a very flattering surface so no idea what it would be like on normal roads.

I didn't like the interior ergonomics - it felt a bit cramped and the mix of shiny plastics, odd buttons, displays etc didn't impress. To me, like the latest Prius generations it's gone for form over function and with each new model the designers seem to think they need to design something completely new and different to before to justify their existence  - this is one of my pet hates, a well designed interior should be retained and at the most tweaked for new features or functionality, doing anything else is an admission you haven't got a clue!

The noise emitted from the car was also odd, there was a surprising amount of motor noise and a lot of clicks, whirrs, and whines plus a lot of blower noise during and after the fast run.

Overall, not a bad car but a bit compromised IMHO.

I wouldn't want to be in Shell's position, fuel sales will start to decline over the next 10 years so unless they do something now they will be stuffed.

Personally I can't see how any Rapids will make any money, if an EH Rapid charger was going all day every day it would make less than £200 a day which means it would have to be running reliably for 250 days to return £50K, that doesn't account for any maintenance or operating costs like site rental, 4G fees or indeed the all important electric.

250 days is quite a short period to expect to cover the capital costs. 1000 days aka 3 years would not be unreasonable if you expected the charger to last several years beyond that. Mind you, that's still nearly 10 charges per pump per day and while some of the EH estate does that easily most of it is nowhere near.

I wonder when economies of scale start kicking in for charger pricing?

Ecotricity have about 300 rapid chargers. Shell own 550 filling stations across the UK and there are another 500+ branded as Shell. If they installed say 10 rapids in each filling station that's 10,000 rapid chargers. I wonder what the numbers look like when you start getting up to that kind of level?

Of course more likely they stick with dribbling in one charger per station across a fraction of the ones they actually own and their overheads will be higher than Ecotricity's.

I look at some of the maths some time ago; you can’t make profit from a single Rapid unless you gain lots of other sales due to it.   The issue is that a single rapid has to be used for less than about 25% of the time otherwise long queue build up.

Once you get up to 4 rapids on a site you can get a reasonable usage of each without getting long queues, the benefit continues until about 8.    Therefore ideally you need clusters of at least 8 rapids.

But it needs something like 5% of long-distance drivers to be using none Tesla EVs before the profit starts rolling in.   In some parts of the USA rapids may be making money, not in the UK unless someone else pays most of the costs.

I used to say that about the CPG Charger at Eynsham but they wanted £4.50 for 30mins and I only wanted around 20 miles, it is a boring location as well, there is a shop there but nothing else so I ended up comfort eating, gave up in the end and just REXed it, I see they have changed their charges now it's £1 connection + 30p/kWh so would probably cost me about £3 now but it's still boring.
					 "
bmw1324,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"The point about putting in rapids at filling stations is that the fuel is the honey trap to draw in customers for the shops. For several years the shops have been the profit centres. I seem to recall some very rough estimates that suggested each pump at a filling station made about £15-£20 operating profit per day or <£1 per customer in fuel sales but the average profit from shop sales was in the order of £4-£10 per customer with the majority of the profit being people doing shopping other than fuel evenings and overnight. Operating profit from EV charging should be in the order of £2 per charge with the installation costs of the rapid less than a fuel pump if you add in the maintenance and a contribution to the tank installation cost, plus the residency time of the EV'er in the shop will be about 4x that of the ICE'er. Looks quite a sensible business proposition if you think about it that way even if the initial take up is likely to be low.

The more options we have to fuel the lower the barriers to EV adoption will be so whichever way you look at it this is a good move.  From nextgreencar.com's EV statistics it looks like there's around 2,000ish rapid outlets in the UK now, split between AC and DC with about 3-4x DC although a lot are multiple headed units that won't support multiple vehicles charging. At my last count there are around 280 operational Tesla stalls so that would make it about 1800 multi-make rapids with about 400 AC, 1500 CHAdeMO and 750 CCS outlets as a rough estimate. I don't know for sure how many BEVs are on the roads but I think the figure for last year was around 10,000 so maybe 12,000 by now with 3-4,000 of them being Teslas. That makes about 6 cars per rapid for non Teslas - it feels a lot lower than that but I don't see that many BEVs charging (Tesla apart) on my travels so maybe it's right. It is a chicken and egg problem to some degree, but at the moment (on paper at least) it looks like on average there are enough rapids to support the existing fleet. Average numbers don't give the whole picture of course, Wales in particular is a very poorly served part of the country, but the numbers are interesting!

This amounts to 5 chargers of which  3 are singles, Only 1 CCS (currently showing problems on ZapMap)  I have had failed charges at 4 out of 5 locations.

		Biggest question is how to stop them from being ICE'd.......Click to expand...
	
It could be that any potential ICE'ing problem will be minimal at a recognised multi-fuel filling station. Why would any car be parking for a while anyway when it's there to fill up its tank, tyres or screenwash. Of course if there is a mini-market there then some may arrive for shopping only and attention will have to be given to proper signage. But even then the driver would be easy to locate and receive helpful advice and education.
					 "
bmw1358,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I think that the majority of the time ICE'ing is just a lack of understanding, rather than a deliberate disregard of signage. It's always going to be awkward telling someone that they've ICE'd you, no matter how diplomatic you are.

Even a simple manual barrier with signage attached would do the job. It wouldn't add that much more to charger  installs.

Yes. Having the station manned is a big plus. The Station manager at Derby A50/A38 was full of enthusiasm and I am sure she would sort things out even if it ended up being a 3 pin socket.

I'd regard it the same as buying petrol at a motorway services, though more extreme, you only do it when necessary, most of the time you plan to buy elsewhere but if the income they get means its there to be used, thats a whole lot better than the alternative, which is no chargers because the accountants worked out that at 25p they arent paying back the not inconsiderable installation cost.

bmw1396,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"Spent an interesting afternoon in the drizzle at Shell Willington with several people from Shell that are making the chargers happen. The comms weren't working on the charger so the card that the fuel station staff have access to was essential. Got a charge anyway. This is definitely a massive step forward. I'm confident that even though it is a single charger there is a good chance of actually getting a charge. Polar have no way past loss of post comms. Ecotricty sometimes manage free vend but it's hit and miss. 

Vodafone proving to be the weak point again.

The drizzle made the point about cover quite well so they are looking into that. 

Waiting area is nice and I can see the car and whether it's finished charging or not as there is a light on the charging handle which is on when it's charging and goes out when it's finished. Access is fairly easy and they will be monitoring mis-use. 

25p a kWh is a good price. With cover and guaranteed back up and people to help then I think a higher price per kWh is reasonable. Maybe not the full 49p a kWh always but if you really need to charge up and you know it's always going to work even if you have lost your phone, or it's not working properly then it's so much better. 

It's a 4 hour fix time for non engineer type of issues and 24 hour if it's a hardware related fault and it needs a proper engineer out. This is working week though so again weekends might not be so good. But if that is stuck to then it's streets ahead of the others that are happy to leave chargers broken weeks or months. 

Hopefully contactless will be implemented sooner rather than later.

Charger is fairly easy to use but it is button based rather than touchscreen but the buttons seem to line up rather better than they do on DBT chargers which are always confusing. It's very neat looking. No cabling dangling all over the shop either.

Until cars have a much larger range, the winner will be the charger you can use without having to drive an additional 40 miles.    Once cars have much longer ranges, most EV drivers will not use rapid chargers often.  (But the rapids will be well used due to so many more EV drivers.)  It's like running low on oil in an ICE, so uncommon to have to buy oil at a petrol station that the cost is not much of a factor.
					 "

It would be like Texaco opening a new filling station in Buckingham and charging £3.50 a litre for petrol when Shell, BP, Tesco and Esso all charge between £1.18 p/l and £1.22 p/l.

Trust me they aint gonna recover the capital costs of the new filling station as no one will use it!!!!!Click to expand...
	
I think you would if the alternative was that or getting flatbedded home!

And, if no one uses them even those with no alternative, or if no one uses them because there is a charger 2 miles down the road at 60%of the price, well then they will either reduce the price or stop installing them. If they can’t make a profit at less than 49p for example (including additional spend in cafe and shop) , they won’t install them.  i have no idea if they can and possibly they don’t yet either, they are putting a toe  in the water to test.

The price will find its own level, it doesn’t need people double guessing here who have no idea of the costs, profit etc that Shell will be making at that price . That will be decided by the users. Though FWIW if the actual price difference is two or three quid compared to a ten mile detour, or a nice cafe compared to a bare bones station in the middle of nowhere, ill spend the extra money. Maybe you wouldn’t, that’s your choice.

And someone upthread mentioned, it’s all very well having some other organisation selling at half the price or less, but if the chargers aren’t working for weeks at a time, that’s only really a theoretical price. In your analogy above, Shell BP etc may be “selling” at 1/3 the price of Texaco but are closed most days, even when the sign says open, as their pumps are broken and have been for weeks.

bmw1406,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I think the pricing is ideal. It should mean people will stop only for 10kWh or so on the occasions they can't get home or to their preferred charger.

I would view it as a 'Plan C' and be very happy at 49p/kWh if Plan B had also failed and it meant it was more likely to be free when I got there. 10kWh per charge could see a throughput of 4 people an hour. I think it is potentially a very good model, TBH, both for drivers and for Shell.

As mentioned, with on-site 24hr backup ... sorry ...but that is really WORTH something extra!!!

If they end up under-utilised and Shell watch potential business drive by, they will have to reconsider pricing. But seems good to me. I am not going to get a £30k car and then worry about a fiver every now and again. Some people will pay £1000s to save a few pounds, and complain like whingeing old biddies when they don't.

They might do, depends how many cars there are, their ranges, the trips people make etc. It might not even be Plan C, it might be Plan B, an easier stop without diverting, especially as, as range increases,  the need for mid trip stops diminishes or goes away, for most people for most trips.

You could equally well ask why people pay abut 10p a litre more at motorway service stations, which is probably a fiver if you are filling up, when they could save that by filling up near to home or driving off the motorway for a couple of miles.  Or why they dont all bring packed lunches instead of eating at the services high prices, or take their own bottles of water filled from the tap, and a thermos of tea, etc etc. So, people paying more for convenience and speed is a recognised fact. The only question is, how much more, which Shell no doubt will find out through trial.

An extra five or ten pounds a couple of times a year is no biggie to me if the convenience factor works (and the charger works, unlike half the chargers i read about here). If its every week, you need a different BEV or a hybrid or Rex.
					 "
bmw1411,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"My response to all the valid observations here is that we are in new territory and the 'Plan C' might arise for any number of reasons not yet fully anticipated, not least of which is a sudden jump in popularity in which you have found long queues at your preferred destinations.

There might be diversions and such, which again is a relatively minor matter for ICE but can be critical if you are already aiming for minimum SoC back at home.

I can think of two or three further scenarios where it is nothing to do with a disheveled network but simply down to EVs being what they currently are; relatively slow to charge and always will be (compared with an ICE at 20~30MW), the inevitable growth of EV ownership, and a lack of planning at national level.

I also see nothing particularly profiteering in a 49p/kWh cost rate when you consider the installation and maintenance costs of these things. We have gone over that one many times before, and you don't compare the price of water out of your tap when you buy a bottle of water in a shop because you're thirsty.

It's also cost-equivalent to a ~50mpg car, so if you don't like it, just go buy an ICE and pay that sort of price all year long.

At least we've moved on from the earlier discussions where people were still complaining about any sort of charging and still wanted it for free!!! Those discussions seem to have now stopped, so perhaps we're entering a mature phase of discussing charging provision now?

As the comments on the article say, that was a problem with the online retailers not specifically a problem with contactless. You could do the same as they did using non-contactless cards if you can just get hold of the details off the front of the card.

The solution of course is to always check your statements as there shouldn't be any problem getting those fraudulent transactions refunded.

Besides if they support contactless that gives me the option to use Android Pay for greater security (and others could no doubt use Apple's equivalent). That means retailers never have access to your real card details at all.

With an EV you have to calculate the cost of the entire trip including home charge at ~3p/kWh and top-up charge to reach the destination at 49p/kWh. Then average it out. 

An example could be a 150 mile trip in a 30 Leaf. Drive 100 miles from home at a cost of £3. Top up with 50 miles at a Shell Rapid at a cost of £6. Overall trip of 150 miles has cost £9  - or 6p per mile. 

As this Shell facility has enabled such trips to be taken, over and above normal use within battery range, and has come in below an average petrol cost for the entire trip, then I would suggest that at 49p/kWh it still represents good value, if only for the convenience.

If I'm driving a repmobile and doing hundreds of miles/day, I think I'd be justified in demanding a 400 mile car for that job.

400 mile range cars might be available in 5 years time, but they probably won't be affordable for people who don't really need them.  We're relying on significant improvements in battery costs to make even the 200-mile range cars affordable for general use.

Your hypothetical 400-mile-a-day road warrior will probably justify the 400-mile car (though I don't know how he earns his living since that's 8 hours/day just driving, and that assumes fast roads, so he's not a delivery driver).

Wealthy people will also buy 400-mile cars just because they can - it's a luxury.

For the rest of us, we need cars that can cover our normal daily driving without needing to charge en-route, and which can handle our exceptional driving with a tolerable amount of (usually rapid) charging.  That probably means 200-odd mile range for most people, though there's a range of cost/convenience and the need is reduced if you have access to more than one car (families that need 2 cars could probably go for one long and one short range).

If you only use public rapid charging once a month, then it doesn't matter that it's quite expensive, you just want it to be reliable - which means there's a reasonable business case for it once there are enough EVs on the roads.

In that scenario, you still need slow charging at places like hotels, and on those rare occasions when you are going out of range and will need a rapid charge, you'd prefer to get it while parked at your destination if possible - so again, a reasonable business opportunity at places where EVs congregate, probably not everywhere but where it's both cheaper to provide than the equivalent number of rapids and offers more convenience, it makes sense.  The ""equivalent number of rapids"" isn't a straightforward comparison of the output power - it's also related to the utilisation factor in both cases, so the economics will make sense at some locations but not others.

There's also the question of PHEVs, which are likely to be around in large numbers for some years to come, and may well be offered subsidised charging in the name of better air quality.  This is in essence a completely separate facility from charging for BEVs, but there are probably economies of scale in combining them.

Finally, there's the question of people without the ability to charge at home.  I don't know what the solution is here - IMO rapids are going to be just too expensive when you consider the utilisation factor and the need for battery storage etc.  Possibly the sockets-on-lampposts will win out, or inductive chargers installed on the street; possibly slow charging at supermarkets/shopping centres has a role to play, quite possibly a combination of all of these.

When I did the maths some time ago, to charge X (X being over 100) cars per day it cost about the same to install Rapid as it did to install the many more 7kw posts needed.  But this depended on the cars being quickly removed from the Rapids as soon as they were charged to about 80%.

But also the utilisation factor during the day, and the cost of power.

For rapids aimed at long-distance drivers, the usage will be spread moderately through the day (obviously not uniformly, but spread quite widely).

For rapids aimed at commuters who have no home charging, the demand is likely to be focused at peak commute times and so achieve less utilisation.  Also, this means the power demand is at precisely the wrong time of day, effectively requiring the rapids to be equipped with batteries (or else you pay peak power prices to have someone else supply the batteries to the grid), again making the rapids more expensive.

IMO there will always be a need for rapid chargers regardless of range. What if you get back from a long trip, your car is nearly empty and then you get a call from a family member that they need help... without a rapid charger on route you might not be able to do that trip. Also, a 400 mile car could require more than a single overnight to charge fully at normal household charge rates (7kW).

That argument only works if you go on the basis that’s where you’d fuel your EV on a regular basis but that won’t be the case since it wouldn’t be economic even without such a tax. These will be occasional use, where they won’t make much difference to the overall cost of running the EV. Say once in a blue moon i pay 2x the cost of petrol, but 99% of the time I’m paying 1/4, that 2x is irrelevant. With enough passing traffic there will be enough once in a blue moon users to make it profitable for Shell at either price (if there isn’t, they will adjust the price until there is, or shut them down)

Longer term the government will have to  recoup the tax some way, but it’s unlikely it wil be  through this mechanism as it simply won’t raise enough, it addresses too small a proportion. By that time, whatever the mechanism is, we’ll be locked into BEVs

You have to include the monthly subscription in that comparison, and Chargemaster are banking on the fact that most of their users won't be doing a massive amount of charging each month so they can keep the subscriptions for the heavy users subsidised by the light users.

bmw1505,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"My V8 range rover runs on LPG and costs about 15p a mile at a guess (circa 15mpg and 50p a litre for gas). The A4 (petrol turbo) uses super unleaded and costs a bit more, maybe 18p or so.

I currently use the ICE when i'm doing longer journeys due to the standard EV range and charging issues. Plus the B250 doesnt rapid charge, but thats a side issue. If i'm doing a long journey, and having to put up with the inconvenience of stopping and charging, it needs to be cheaper than the ICE, by a decent margin.

My B250 averages 2.4mile/kwh (from the wall, which is what the pump is charging). Electricity at 8p a kwh means its costing me abour 3.5p a mile. Electricity at 49p a kwh means its costing me 20p a mile.

So clearly i'll be taking the V8.
					 "
bmw1506,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"That would be so if you were paying 49p for all your charging but you wouldn't charge at Shell stations at 49p except when you needed to or if it was so much more convenient that you were prepared to pay it. So would you actually still take your V8 if you could charge at a much more sensible price for most of your trip with perhaps a single charge to bridge a gap at a Shell?

I think it isn't right to look at the price of charging without considering how often you might use it. If it is something you would use all the time then it  clearly must be at a price that makes sense for regular use but for occasional or emergency use then it would be cutting off your nose to spit your face (so to speak) when it would still be a lot cheaper overall to take the EV.

I do understand that with the B250 that decision is modified a lot by the inconvenience of no rapid charging and range but as you say... that is a side issue 
					 "
bmw1507,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"i guess it depends on the journey as always. I commute 70odd miles a day in the b250. It works fine as i charge at work. On the other hand, i drove the B250 (rather carefully) to my mates house 60miles away at the weekend, arriving with around 30% battery and clearly needed a charge to get home. Luckily we were there for many hours and i simply plugged it in, but had the journey depended on a rapid charger that was going to cost me 49p a kwh, plus having to stop for a half hour on the way home, i'd clearly have taken one of the ICE cars instead.

The longer the journey gets the more times your relying on the expensive chargers, the worse the whole deal becomes.

If its your only car, then maybe it works out ok against the alternative of hiring an ICE, but that still doesnt change the fact that for me, its a ripoff and i wouldnt be using it.

The problem is that the additional costs involved in producing an EV pushes these cars out of range of what is considered normal or acceptable for a small car. The actual build costs of small and large cars are not that much different and most small cars are only marginally profitable anyway -- that's why so many of them are badge-engineered between brands in order to bring unit costs down.

The silly thing people do when they make comparisons with ICE cars, is they compare the figure they get from driving along like a nun, drafting lorries and never exceeding 55mph, with the figure the rep-mobile diesel achieves doing 80mph...

I dont think 4 or 5miles per kwh is realistic if you drive in a ""normal"" manner. Especially on motorways where the average speed can be closer to 80 in reality. Even the EPA range figures dont use a figure anywhere near that high.

Also, bear in mind the Merc figure is wall to wheel, rather than battery to wheel, which is different to most other EV's. The recon 20% difference, so 2.4 in the merc would show as close to 3 in most BEV's. For cost comparisons, the Merc figures are actually what you want to be using, as you dont pay for electricity coming out the battery, you pay for the electricity going into it.

True, but those inefficiencies are there for normal AC charging too (cooling maybe slightly cheaper, constant overheads for BMS having more effect when charging slower, so probably balancing out).  And the efficiency of the on-board charger is going to be very similar to the off-board one in a DC chargepoint.

So in either case the number of kWh to deliver a given amount of charge to the battery will be about 10% less if you measured the DC than if you measured the AC.

The on-board inefficiencies I have no argument about - as you say, once I've taken the energy it's down to me what the car then does with it.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if everybody is doing the same thing (per the fruity examples above), just like quoting prices with or without VAT.  We all know the VAT's got to be paid (or the mouldy apples thrown away), it's just a question of what basis the price is quoted on.

Right, but if you only plan to use Shell occasionally it could still work out cheaper than Polar subscription rates. It all comes down to where in the country you are, and where you might want to charge.

I just realised there's a Polar rapid on a route that I might reasonably want to use once or twice a month. 'Great' I thought, perhaps a reason for signing up. Then I realised it's one with a flat rate per use which I can already get without subscribing, so scratch that one off the list. I still have no Polar rapids that are anywhere I could reasonably expect to use, so there is no way (for me) that Polar makes sense. For many others whose journeys are slightly different it's a bargain.

I would like to know  the chargers  Current/Voltage characteristics and how they operate with various batteries. For instance the DBT units seem to top out at 100 Amps best I have seen is 106 Amps. So with the I3 fairly low state of charge and with the battery at 360 Volts charger power is only 36 kW a lot different to the 43 kW stated max from a DBT and 50 kW from the spec. Be good to know how various cars can charge if not constrained by the charger.

Hi Duncan,
                  The 390 Volt will be the battery voltage at that particular state of charge. A low state of charge will be about 360 Volt. Then I think the chargers maximum current is the limiting factor (for DBT anyway). The spec calls up for 500 Volt max and 125 Amp max. The voltage when charging a battery is lower at a lower state of charge.  So as the charge progresses power increases due to the battery voltage rising and the current staying the same. So when I have charged on a DBT it always starts low 36 kW and ends up at 43-45 kW (usually at Lichfield).  The charger voltage will be the same as the battery voltage i.e. the charger outputs it's maximum current (usually) and the voltage is a function of that current and the battery characteristics (usually internal resistance). The voltage on the battery terminals and the voltage on the charger output will be practically the same.

My question is what would happen if the charger was unlimited and it was only the battery that controlled the current.

bmw1557,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"So another one has gone live near Chertsey and the M3/M25 junction. I had a Model S for the weekend and it was en route so decided to check it out. 

I have to say, they’re doing this properly. It was a prominent position near the back of the site visible as soon as you drive in with a very well marked bay so unlikely to be ICE’d. They’ve also fitted a motion activated LED floodlight above the parking bay so there’s no issues with lighting at night. A nice touch. 

The app was slightly fiddly the first time I used it as it directs to a site to input payment details. I’d much prefer it linked to my Apple Pay or took card so I’m looking forward to contactless. Once it got going the live charging summary was useful and it even provides the current speed information. 

The machine itself is spot on. I can’t imagine people will ever put the plugs back incorrectly. I was also getting a consistent 48kw which is higher than I’ve seen on other Chademo chargers I’ve used. 

I’d have no problems rolling up to these sites with only 2 miles left. It feels like it’s properly supported and the experience gave me a lot of confidence that they might actually be committed to this. 

As for the cost. I think the initial free charging periods on other networks have created an expectation that charging should be free or as cheap as the electricity at home. That’s never going to happen in the real world as these machines aren’t free! As long as it’s properly supported, as it seems to be, and continues to use modern, fast and reliable hardware it’s worth every penny. The blended cost of the journey when most charging is still done at home is still very low. And I’d prefer the cost is high to ensure people only use it when they really need must to increase availability. 

Overall a big thumbs up from me and I’ll be using these in preference to other networks when there’s a choice!

Nice review. Just a few points I'd like to pick up on.

 I think the expectation that charging an electric vehicle should be free has long since gone, if in fact it ever really existed. The main issue in the past has been whether or not public chargers had a fair tariff, which in the most part has been largely addressed now. What we want is a sensible, reliable, nationwide rapid charging infrastructure, not a free one.

Is that a hypothetical or is there one near Chersley? If so I missed it on Zap Map! In any case I'd probably still make a beeline for Shell. No one lingers at a petrol station longer than they absolutely have to so it's unlikely to be ICE'd and if anyone is already charging they're probably hanging around and available to ask how long they'll be. I don't like using chargers in car parks - they get full and people will park there for convenience and you can't track down the owner. I was on my way back from Bournemouth to Kent and every Chargernet rapid I tried to do some destination charging was ICE'd. Hence the Shell stop on my way home.

Once you've installed the app you can ""monitor"" charge points. If someone starts using it as you're en route it will flash up a notification so you're pre warned or can divert to an alternative. So at least the app does have some perks if it is a little fiddly. I didn't have any connectivity issues though and it remembered my session.

bmw1565,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"49 pence per kWh seems okay, given that we do most of our charging at home.

All of the Shell garages I've been in recently are pushing toward their app for Pay at Pump, so I'm not surprised they're doing the same for the EV chargers.

Even if they work ""most"" of the time, after one or two failed experiences  I suspect many will prefer to factor in a reliable operation in their route and go there in the first place ... with one proviso, if you go to Shell and keep finding its in use because there is only one, that itsn't much different.

One charger per location seems like a poor strategy and why they are setting out like this seems strange, IMO they'd be better starting with 1/4 the locations and 4x the pumps so you are pretty much assured you can drive out of your way to them and find a spare charger, so they dont have a reputation of being ""BEV'd"" all the time?

+1 - I actively avoid sites with only one rapid. Too high a chance of it being ICEd/EVed/broken/in use. Despite their numerous, extensive and unforgivable faults, Ecotricity still get the bulk of my money for long distance travel, simply because there are two/three units at most locations and I'm 99% likely to be able to charge first time without a delay.

I have a Polar Plus card and was loving the roll-out of the new Ultrachargers. Finally an opportunity to move away from Ecotricity, I thought. Unfortunately I've only been able to charge on 2 out of 6 attempts because the chargers have been in use. A missed opportunity from Chargemaster there. I now don't bother with them - it's not worth my time detouring even slightly from my route to save a couple of quid, given there's a high chance of not being able to charge.

Shell should be installing at least two chargers at each location if they really want to compete, especially in their London locations where they're going to be frequently used by the new fleet of black cabs.
					 "
bmw1573,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I'd think Shell would be looking at usage and deciding where to add chargers.

But stating your anecdote doesn't discount mine. I find the single-unit Polar rapids to be used frequently and often hogged because of their locations and their low pricing. My most recent encounters were the Holiday Inn by the M6, where a BMW PHEV had been plugged in for over an hour (I continued to Corley, where both Ecotricity chargers were available and working), the Harvester in Didcot, which had a Leaf charging and an i3 waiting (proceeded to Chieveley where both chargers were working), Eveham Leisure Centre, which had a Zoe that had been plugged in for 45 minutes but the driver nowhere to be seen - presumably, 'leisuring' themselves! (I proceeded to Hopwood Park where Ecotricity was working - though to be fair I didn't have time to check the other pump but I assume it was working).

I accept that Ecotricity are slow to fix problems (in fact, I'm quite profuse about it) but two chargers at a site reduces charger anxiety massively and gives me a much higher chance of continuing my journey without issue/delay.

Unless you own a Chademo connected car you've effectively only had one charger that you can use at most Ecotricity sites so one charger per location is much the same.

Taxi's are an interesting one, if there is a mass change to the range extender taxi's and queue's at chargers there will be enormous pressure to install more of them, they could provide the demand that charge point owners require to put in big investments. I wonder if we will end up with chargers at taxi ranks by stations and airports. A taxi driver will probably want to be plugged in if they are waiting for a fare.

There is - the Chargepoint Express Plus is modular, with the power equipment and buffer battery separate from the charge heads. Each system therefore can service multiple heads simultaneously. Instavolt have said that they're going to start installing these soon. Cahors/EVtronic also make a charger with an 18kWh buffer battery - this can be used to power a second 'satellite' charger. CPG are starting to install these, but without the second charger unfortunately. They're used quite a lot in France - see attached photo for one I used in the summer.

The Shell install is great news and I am glad that people are not moaning about the cost given the previous mammoth thread after EH introduced a fee for charging. Not cheap but if it is sustainable and the chargers can be well maintained then worth it. I can see it being a big hit in London with the phev taxis.

Regarding 2 chargers per location, nice to have but I would prefer twice as many charger locations  such as Norfolk, Wales and other areas lacking rapids. 

They could perhaps add a 3 pin, commando, or type 2 to each install that is kept in a locked box to be opened by the manager/staff if the rapid goes down and someone is desperate. Maybe charge £1 or 2 per hour for 3/7kw to get you on your way. It would be very cheap to add this to an install and make the locations a 100% guaranteed stop, even if you turn up in turtle mode. The above is assuming they will be installed to 24hr service stations. Sounds a bit heath robinson but would be vastly cheaper than a second rapid and would allow a quicker expansion of the network to more areas. Also if people know it is a 100% guaranteed charge location 24/7, then EV drivers are more likely to plan their journey via Shell without the need for all that plan B, C, D stuff.

The problem with rolling out individual rapid chargers, as no charging operator seems to have realised yet, is that a single rapid charger on its own can't be relied upon, so people in real need will be reluctant to plan their journey to use it, and therefore gauging the ""demand"" using a single rapid charger at each site is a fools game.

You don't have to be bitten by arriving at a non functional, single solitary rapid charger more than a few times before you are wary of ever making out of range trips in an EV again.

There are numerous examples of people on this forum - who by being on this forum demonstrate more geeky interest in EV's than your average motorist will, who have the support mechanism of information and advice on this forum, know how to use zap-map and plugshare etc who still have decided that they will no longer attempt any out of range trips because they have been bitten one too many times by out of order rapid chargers. I think that is a sad state of affairs, but I don't blame them one little bit.

I'm as technical and nerdy an EV driver as you will find, I have a 60 mile range Ion and I will not make an out of range journey that relies on a particular rapid charger to be working where there are no Plan B alternatives.

The risk of arriving and finding no comms or a hardware fault is just too great to risk stranding my family (including a small child) there, and at the very least will be a complete day ruiner. I do have an AA membership but I am definitely not using that as my regular plan B!

The public need confidence in the charging network. They need to know that they can drive somewhere and expect A charger to be working without having to ""check ahead"" and cross their fingers and toes, if this doesn't happen, EV's are going to experience a major backlash once the unforgiving general motoring public tries to come on board.

The solution to this problem of ""confidence"" (or lack of) in public charging is very simple:

1) Free vend on comms lost must happen. No ifs, buts, maybes, and it needs legislation to enforce it. There should never, ever, be a situation where a paying customer who has arrived to charge cannot charge because of a loss of communication with the back end at the other end of the country, but the hardware on site has power and is otherwise working.

If there is a comms failure, that is the vendors fault, they need to stomach the cost of lost revenue or provide a way to do delayed transaction processing. I've seen all the arguments about how this is too hard or expensive to implement but I'm not interested. Make it happen before legislation makes you make it happen.

2) There should be a minimum of two rapid chargers at every location, primarily for hardware redundancy in the case of faults, but a nice side effect is that the chances of having to queue are greatly reduced, improving the user experience as well. When I pull up at a rapid charger I have two main fears - is it working ? And is it already in use by someone who is going to be there for a long time...(3rd being is it ICE'ed - but that hasn't happened to me yet)

The chances of two rapid chargers both being faulty, damaged, or stuck in emergency lockout at the same time statistically speaking is vanishingly small compared the chances of this being the case with one charger, and if both have free vend on comms loss the chance of arriving at a site and being unable to charge will be vanishingly small compared to what it is now.

I've only been driving an EV since February, I very rarely rapid charge but when I do I always live in fear of the charger being down or blocked, and in the 20 or so rapid charges I've done about 5 have been unsuccessful, and in all cases there was no redundant unit on site. Not good averages!

Now I grant that with the Shell chargers there are in store staff available to help with any problems such as resetting a unit (I hope ?) or lending a card if there is a comms problem, so that is a potential advantage, but if you arrive and find a broken plug lying on the ground, what realistically can minimum wage service station staff do to help with that ? Nothing, except book an engineer visit for the following day, which doesn't help you specifically.

If there was a redundant unit there, the day is saved and the motorist has confidence in the reliability of the charging network. Pretty simple really.

		Once you've installed the app you can ""monitor"" charge points. If someone starts using it as you're en route it will flash up a notification so you're pre warned or can divert to an alternative. So at least the app does have some perks if it is a little fiddly. I didn't have any connectivity issues though and it remembered my session.Click to expand...
	
Which app is that then?    I'm really interested and encouraged to see Shell be first out of the gate with this technology. The question of ""infrastructure"" has remained to date, with the efforts thus far not being sufficient to drive a larger scale national uptake of EV.    This is a good development that will spur the competition to follow, and may just cause the incumbents to get their acts together, more joined up, more standardised approach to purchasing kW out on the roads.

It has a silly little screen, but it's all intuitive - Press Start on the screen, connect the cable, then hold your GeniePoint RFID on the screen (or use the app), and off it goes. 

The units are louder than Ecotricity DBT chargers*, but unlike those, the display doesn't show anything other than the Start screen - so you've no idea how much electricity you're taking, and you have to remember when you started, to avoid the risk of incurring a parking penalty for staying longer than an hour.

Putting in a charger, especially a high current one, can cost a lot more than just the post,  especially if they have to upgrade electrical service to accommodate it.  They probably picked the 10 cheapest stations to install chargers at, not the 10 that get them the best coverage.

You can say if they did put in 100kW then that would become a serious option for drivers who could stop for just 12 minutes charge (as long as it takes me to wait for a liquefied dinosaur pump sometimes!) and receive 100 EV miles of charge (in the situation that they could reach the 100kW rate - as we know it is variable).

Shell don't make any significant money at the retail side, mostly they are trying to cover costs and they don't actually run a lot of the sites themselves. Like most big oil, they have been selling off the sites to consortiums that want to develop the retail side.  

Shell's profit is made on of the wholesale price of fuel and other fossil fuel activities. There really isn't any money to be made by Shell selling EV charging and clearly making hydrogen from fossil fuels is far more profitable for them.

It would be really great to get that sort of speed from low SOC, once I can actually find such chargers.

Happy to pay £3 + kWh for that, but even a full 50kW would work well.

This is really what we need, 10 minute 'pit stops' that take little longer than a regular fuel-fill. 10 mins at 100kW should be worth ~60 miles. If we can get that sort of through-put on EV charging then there is really no need to resort to a huge battery if you are doing less than a few hundred miles.

That said, as a splash and dash location, rather than a full recharge hub, maybe the 49p/kWh is okay in this instance. Encouraging a quick turnover rather than a long stay, thus allowing more splash and dashers to get their fill.

Having been tipped off to this, the perpetrator added the embellishment which changed the 'c' to a 'g', which was the quickest way to avoid a confrontation with the law.

The name then stuck there, as given by an American fraudster.

(I expect that from memory I might be adding embellishments myself, but in the world of illogical neuro-typicals, better to make up a good story than stick to facts, it only confuses them.)

The scientific name for petrol is 'octane' as the modal molecule contains 8 carbon atoms, but there are additional hydrocarbons, longer and shorter, and a soup of other stuff. So trade names apply to the particular recipes.

Toyota Mirai Review (2017) | Autocar

300 mile range....Click to expand...
	
I was lucky enough to have a drive in a Mirai at the recent LCV event. It's quite a nice smooth drive, but round the Alpine circuit felt underpowered, wallowy on the handling and not great braking characteristics. It did seem very quiet at high speed on the bowl but I know from past experience that's a very flattering surface so no idea what it would be like on normal roads.

I didn't like the interior ergonomics - it felt a bit cramped and the mix of shiny plastics, odd buttons, displays etc didn't impress. To me, like the latest Prius generations it's gone for form over function and with each new model the designers seem to think they need to design something completely new and different to before to justify their existence  - this is one of my pet hates, a well designed interior should be retained and at the most tweaked for new features or functionality, doing anything else is an admission you haven't got a clue!

The noise emitted from the car was also odd, there was a surprising amount of motor noise and a lot of clicks, whirrs, and whines plus a lot of blower noise during and after the fast run.

Overall, not a bad car but a bit compromised IMHO.

Personally I can't see how any Rapids will make any money, if an EH Rapid charger was going all day every day it would make less than £200 a day which means it would have to be running reliably for 250 days to return £50K, that doesn't account for any maintenance or operating costs like site rental, 4G fees or indeed the all important electric.

250 days is quite a short period to expect to cover the capital costs. 1000 days aka 3 years would not be unreasonable if you expected the charger to last several years beyond that. Mind you, that's still nearly 10 charges per pump per day and while some of the EH estate does that easily most of it is nowhere near.

I wonder when economies of scale start kicking in for charger pricing?

Ecotricity have about 300 rapid chargers. Shell own 550 filling stations across the UK and there are another 500+ branded as Shell. If they installed say 10 rapids in each filling station that's 10,000 rapid chargers. I wonder what the numbers look like when you start getting up to that kind of level?

Of course more likely they stick with dribbling in one charger per station across a fraction of the ones they actually own and their overheads will be higher than Ecotricity's.

I look at some of the maths some time ago; you can’t make profit from a single Rapid unless you gain lots of other sales due to it.   The issue is that a single rapid has to be used for less than about 25% of the time otherwise long queue build up.

Once you get up to 4 rapids on a site you can get a reasonable usage of each without getting long queues, the benefit continues until about 8.    Therefore ideally you need clusters of at least 8 rapids.

But it needs something like 5% of long-distance drivers to be using none Tesla EVs before the profit starts rolling in.   In some parts of the USA rapids may be making money, not in the UK unless someone else pays most of the costs.

					 "
bmw324,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"The point about putting in rapids at filling stations is that the fuel is the honey trap to draw in customers for the shops. For several years the shops have been the profit centres. I seem to recall some very rough estimates that suggested each pump at a filling station made about £15-£20 operating profit per day or <£1 per customer in fuel sales but the average profit from shop sales was in the order of £4-£10 per customer with the majority of the profit being people doing shopping other than fuel evenings and overnight. Operating profit from EV charging should be in the order of £2 per charge with the installation costs of the rapid less than a fuel pump if you add in the maintenance and a contribution to the tank installation cost, plus the residency time of the EV'er in the shop will be about 4x that of the ICE'er. Looks quite a sensible business proposition if you think about it that way even if the initial take up is likely to be low.

The more options we have to fuel the lower the barriers to EV adoption will be so whichever way you look at it this is a good move.  From nextgreencar.com's EV statistics it looks like there's around 2,000ish rapid outlets in the UK now, split between AC and DC with about 3-4x DC although a lot are multiple headed units that won't support multiple vehicles charging. At my last count there are around 280 operational Tesla stalls so that would make it about 1800 multi-make rapids with about 400 AC, 1500 CHAdeMO and 750 CCS outlets as a rough estimate. I don't know for sure how many BEVs are on the roads but I think the figure for last year was around 10,000 so maybe 12,000 by now with 3-4,000 of them being Teslas. That makes about 6 cars per rapid for non Teslas - it feels a lot lower than that but I don't see that many BEVs charging (Tesla apart) on my travels so maybe it's right. It is a chicken and egg problem to some degree, but at the moment (on paper at least) it looks like on average there are enough rapids to support the existing fleet. Average numbers don't give the whole picture of course, Wales in particular is a very poorly served part of the country, but the numbers are interesting!

Siemens EFACEC triple-headed rapid charger. They're normally pretty good.
Screen says to present RFID. Now, I know that it's run by Allego, and they've got roaming agreements with New Motion and Plugsurfing. I've got both of those.
No. This is no regular Allego charge point. It doesn't accept either of them.
Okay, so time to dig out my phone. I had already downloaded their Smoov app
My phone had connected to the on-site wifi and was wanting to sign into that, giving Shell my contact details before giving any connectivity.
Sod that. Turn off the wifi on the phone.
Fire up app, locate the charger. Good enough so far.
It asks what vehicle type I have. Don't think I should need to tell them what vehicle type it is. Left that field blank
Choose Chademo. 
Payment screen, asks for Amex, Mastercard or Visa. (Do they really need to ask that? It can easily be inferred by the PAN on the card).
Next screen, key in card details. Actually, it will try to read the card number from the front of the card, which worked, but still wanted me to key in the cardholder name, and CVV2.
Fair enough
Then it wanted to know how long I'd be. I have no idea. There's an option for that.
Then it failed with an error

same again. Failed with an error
start again, exit the app and restart it.
Third attempt, it finally worked, and it prompted me to press start on the charger itself.

Let me use a contactless payment card reader on the charge point, or at least an RFID from a provider that your network already accepts on the rest of your network. Your app is the worst I've had to use so far. At least it's pay as you go, and no top-up pre-pay or subscription required.

So, while it's £0.25/kWh, it's reasonably cheap for ad-hoc charging, and a lot cheaper than Source London to charge a vehicle.
If that's half price, I wouldn't pay full whack unless it was a charger of last resort.

When the opportunity exists to buy a congestion charge exempt car without ever needing to plug it in, then that will obviously happen, so the statistics are uninformative without understanding that dynamic.

I think BEV sales would be a better analogue of the number of actual EV miles being run. By that I mean even if they are not 'PHEV' themselves, if there is a doubling [say] of interest in BEVs then there is probably a doubling of interest in PHEV buyers who want to do all electric miles.

I would agree, especially given all the announcements by various manufacturers about making all of their range of cars 'electric' since that usually translates to at minimum phev.

The Milton Keynes hub on the M1 J14 with 10 rapids will be opening early next year. It's at the Coachway with the usual facilities.  I think that will put most of the puny efforts into perspective. Currently my closesest chargers are Tamworth, Donnington, Derby A50 East and Derby A50 West. This amounts to 5 chargers of which  3 are singles, Only 1 CCS (currently showing problems on ZapMap)  I have had failed charges at 4 out of 5 locations. I would keep your money in your pocket and wait until the current monopoly lapses. I am waiting for the first Shell at an MSA to install chargers.

It could be that any potential ICE'ing problem will be minimal at a recognised multi-fuel filling station. Why would any car be parking for a while anyway when it's there to fill up its tank, tyres or screenwash. Of course if there is a mini-market there then some may arrive for shopping only and attention will have to be given to proper signage. But even then the driver would be easy to locate and receive helpful advice and education.
					 "
bmw358,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I think that the majority of the time ICE'ing is just a lack of understanding, rather than a deliberate disregard of signage. It's always going to be awkward telling someone that they've ICE'd you, no matter how diplomatic you are.

Considering I used 295kwh on my Chargemaster account last month and my bill was £15.84p, so 5.3p / kwh. I will just drive straight past these in the Rex unless desperate. Still would cost me 36p / kwh to fill up the i3 from empty so still cheaper than Petrol, but the £1.80 connection charge takes it EH territory, a full fill up or nothing as a splash and dash is not economical vs using most Chargemaster rapids @ 11p kwh, or Free.

Still more choice means EH and Chargemaster Rapids will remain free when I arrive at them which is how I like it.

I really dont see the issue with that, if it funds putting them there so i can use it if needed, then that fair enough, they have to make a return, something people seem to forget.

I'd regard it the same as buying petrol at a motorway services, though more extreme, you only do it when necessary, most of the time you plan to buy elsewhere but if the income they get means its there to be used, thats a whole lot better than the alternative, which is no chargers because the accountants worked out that at 25p they arent paying back the not inconsiderable installation cost.

Thank you for that analysis. I was beginning to think that I was alone with that pragmatic view.
					 "
bmw396,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"Spent an interesting afternoon in the drizzle at Shell Willington with several people from Shell that are making the chargers happen. The comms weren't working on the charger so the card that the fuel station staff have access to was essential. Got a charge anyway. This is definitely a massive step forward. I'm confident that even though it is a single charger there is a good chance of actually getting a charge. Polar have no way past loss of post comms. Ecotricty sometimes manage free vend but it's hit and miss. 

Vodafone proving to be the weak point again.

The drizzle made the point about cover quite well so they are looking into that. 

Waiting area is nice and I can see the car and whether it's finished charging or not as there is a light on the charging handle which is on when it's charging and goes out when it's finished. Access is fairly easy and they will be monitoring mis-use. 

25p a kWh is a good price. With cover and guaranteed back up and people to help then I think a higher price per kWh is reasonable. Maybe not the full 49p a kWh always but if you really need to charge up and you know it's always going to work even if you have lost your phone, or it's not working properly then it's so much better. 

It's a 4 hour fix time for non engineer type of issues and 24 hour if it's a hardware related fault and it needs a proper engineer out. This is working week though so again weekends might not be so good. But if that is stuck to then it's streets ahead of the others that are happy to leave chargers broken weeks or months. 

Hopefully contactless will be implemented sooner rather than later.

Charger is fairly easy to use but it is button based rather than touchscreen but the buttons seem to line up rather better than they do on DBT chargers which are always confusing. It's very neat looking. No cabling dangling all over the shop either. 

Quite impressed. I did make the point about having multiple posts and they have picked places where they can add posts to easily and move other things. The air/water would get moved if they wanted to add posts there for example.

Until cars have a much larger range, the winner will be the charger you can use without having to drive an additional 40 miles.    Once cars have much longer ranges, most EV drivers will not use rapid chargers often.  (But the rapids will be well used due to so many more EV drivers.)  It's like running low on oil in an ICE, so uncommon to have to buy oil at a petrol station that the cost is not much of a factor.
					 "
bmw398,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"Can't disagree with the above, but feel that say 35p a unit ought to be about the right price. I must though confess I have no idea of the up front costs involved with installing the chargers.

Our only danger is that if we try to screw costs down to unrealistic levels when compared to domestic costs then companies dipping their toe in this water may decide that profits are insufficient to justify installing more chargers. This would be counter productive to both parties. Perhaps the proposed 49p/kWh charge could encourage Shell to install at least one Rapid at every outlet under their banner -  if profits are seen.

I can't really disagree - the chargers themselves aren't cheap, I don't expect them to install them for nothing. I don't really have a problem with EH charges either.
However..
1 - It makes EVs a harder sell (people will focus on public charging cost even though they can charge at home 90% of the tim)

I think you would if the alternative was that or getting flatbedded home!

And, if no one uses them even those with no alternative, or if no one uses them because there is a charger 2 miles down the road at 60%of the price, well then they will either reduce the price or stop installing them. If they can’t make a profit at less than 49p for example (including additional spend in cafe and shop) , they won’t install them.  i have no idea if they can and possibly they don’t yet either, they are putting a toe  in the water to test.

The price will find its own level, it doesn’t need people double guessing here who have no idea of the costs, profit etc that Shell will be making at that price . That will be decided by the users. Though FWIW if the actual price difference is two or three quid compared to a ten mile detour, or a nice cafe compared to a bare bones station in the middle of nowhere, ill spend the extra money. Maybe you wouldn’t, that’s your choice.

And someone upthread mentioned, it’s all very well having some other organisation selling at half the price or less, but if the chargers aren’t working for weeks at a time, that’s only really a theoretical price. In your analogy above, Shell BP etc may be “selling” at 1/3 the price of Texaco but are closed most days, even when the sign says open, as their pumps are broken and have been for weeks.
					 "
bmw406,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I think the pricing is ideal. It should mean people will stop only for 10kWh or so on the occasions they can't get home or to their preferred charger.

I would view it as a 'Plan C' and be very happy at 49p/kWh if Plan B had also failed and it meant it was more likely to be free when I got there. 10kWh per charge could see a throughput of 4 people an hour. I think it is potentially a very good model, TBH, both for drivers and for Shell.

As mentioned, with on-site 24hr backup ... sorry ...but that is really WORTH something extra!!!

If they end up under-utilised and Shell watch potential business drive by, they will have to reconsider pricing. But seems good to me. I am not going to get a £30k car and then worry about a fiver every now and again. Some people will pay £1000s to save a few pounds, and complain like whingeing old biddies when they don't.

They might do, depends how many cars there are, their ranges, the trips people make etc. It might not even be Plan C, it might be Plan B, an easier stop without diverting, especially as, as range increases,  the need for mid trip stops diminishes or goes away, for most people for most trips.

You could equally well ask why people pay abut 10p a litre more at motorway service stations, which is probably a fiver if you are filling up, when they could save that by filling up near to home or driving off the motorway for a couple of miles.  Or why they dont all bring packed lunches instead of eating at the services high prices, or take their own bottles of water filled from the tap, and a thermos of tea, etc etc. So, people paying more for convenience and speed is a recognised fact. The only question is, how much more, which Shell no doubt will find out through trial.

An extra five or ten pounds a couple of times a year is no biggie to me if the convenience factor works (and the charger works, unlike half the chargers i read about here). If its every week, you need a different BEV or a hybrid or Rex.
					 "
bmw411,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"My response to all the valid observations here is that we are in new territory and the 'Plan C' might arise for any number of reasons not yet fully anticipated, not least of which is a sudden jump in popularity in which you have found long queues at your preferred destinations.

There might be diversions and such, which again is a relatively minor matter for ICE but can be critical if you are already aiming for minimum SoC back at home.

I can think of two or three further scenarios where it is nothing to do with a disheveled network but simply down to EVs being what they currently are; relatively slow to charge and always will be (compared with an ICE at 20~30MW), the inevitable growth of EV ownership, and a lack of planning at national level.

I also see nothing particularly profiteering in a 49p/kWh cost rate when you consider the installation and maintenance costs of these things. We have gone over that one many times before, and you don't compare the price of water out of your tap when you buy a bottle of water in a shop because you're thirsty.

It's also cost-equivalent to a ~50mpg car, so if you don't like it, just go buy an ICE and pay that sort of price all year long.

At least we've moved on from the earlier discussions where people were still complaining about any sort of charging and still wanted it for free!!! Those discussions seem to have now stopped, so perhaps we're entering a mature phase of discussing charging provision now?

As the comments on the article say, that was a problem with the online retailers not specifically a problem with contactless. You could do the same as they did using non-contactless cards if you can just get hold of the details off the front of the card.

The solution of course is to always check your statements as there shouldn't be any problem getting those fraudulent transactions refunded.

Besides if they support contactless that gives me the option to use Android Pay for greater security (and others could no doubt use Apple's equivalent). That means retailers never have access to your real card details at all.

With an EV you have to calculate the cost of the entire trip including home charge at ~3p/kWh and top-up charge to reach the destination at 49p/kWh. Then average it out. 

An example could be a 150 mile trip in a 30 Leaf. Drive 100 miles from home at a cost of £3. Top up with 50 miles at a Shell Rapid at a cost of £6. Overall trip of 150 miles has cost £9  - or 6p per mile. 

As this Shell facility has enabled such trips to be taken, over and above normal use within battery range, and has come in below an average petrol cost for the entire trip, then I would suggest that at 49p/kWh it still represents good value, if only for the convenience.

bmw454,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"In say 5 years time, when there are a lot of EVs on the road, and battery technology means that 400 mile range cars are available, how many of these cars are ever going to need a Rapid charge at all? Are there any figures to say what the miles/journey distribution in the real world is? Average may be around 30 miles/day, but that's meaningless tbh. If I'm driving a repmobile and doing hundreds of miles/day, I think I'd be justified in demanding a 400 mile car for that job. And if I could log my home charging & bill it to my company, that's another loss for Shell etc. And if I did refill my 400 mile car at a Rapid, that doesn't necessarily mean I need to put another 400 mile's worth of leccy in. Might only need 50 miles worth - so what are the real miles  journeys stats for longer trips? Anyone know? Are Shell gearing up for vans & lorries to use their chargers more than private drivers?

400 mile range cars might be available in 5 years time, but they probably won't be affordable for people who don't really need them.  We're relying on significant improvements in battery costs to make even the 200-mile range cars affordable for general use.

Your hypothetical 400-mile-a-day road warrior will probably justify the 400-mile car (though I don't know how he earns his living since that's 8 hours/day just driving, and that assumes fast roads, so he's not a delivery driver).

Wealthy people will also buy 400-mile cars just because they can - it's a luxury.

For the rest of us, we need cars that can cover our normal daily driving without needing to charge en-route, and which can handle our exceptional driving with a tolerable amount of (usually rapid) charging.  That probably means 200-odd mile range for most people, though there's a range of cost/convenience and the need is reduced if you have access to more than one car (families that need 2 cars could probably go for one long and one short range).

If you only use public rapid charging once a month, then it doesn't matter that it's quite expensive, you just want it to be reliable - which means there's a reasonable business case for it once there are enough EVs on the roads.

In that scenario, you still need slow charging at places like hotels, and on those rare occasions when you are going out of range and will need a rapid charge, you'd prefer to get it while parked at your destination if possible - so again, a reasonable business opportunity at places where EVs congregate, probably not everywhere but where it's both cheaper to provide than the equivalent number of rapids and offers more convenience, it makes sense.  The ""equivalent number of rapids"" isn't a straightforward comparison of the output power - it's also related to the utilisation factor in both cases, so the economics will make sense at some locations but not others.

There's also the question of PHEVs, which are likely to be around in large numbers for some years to come, and may well be offered subsidised charging in the name of better air quality.  This is in essence a completely separate facility from charging for BEVs, but there are probably economies of scale in combining them.

Finally, there's the question of people without the ability to charge at home.  I don't know what the solution is here - IMO rapids are going to be just too expensive when you consider the utilisation factor and the need for battery storage etc.  Possibly the sockets-on-lampposts will win out, or inductive chargers installed on the street; possibly slow charging at supermarkets/shopping centres has a role to play, quite possibly a combination of all of these.

When I did the maths some time ago, to charge X (X being over 100) cars per day it cost about the same to install Rapid as it did to install the many more 7kw posts needed.  But this depended on the cars being quickly removed from the Rapids as soon as they were charged to about 80%.

There's plenty of money to be made in rapid charging, once there is a critical mass of EVs to use them.

But also the utilisation factor during the day, and the cost of power.

For rapids aimed at long-distance drivers, the usage will be spread moderately through the day (obviously not uniformly, but spread quite widely).

For rapids aimed at commuters who have no home charging, the demand is likely to be focused at peak commute times and so achieve less utilisation.  Also, this means the power demand is at precisely the wrong time of day, effectively requiring the rapids to be equipped with batteries (or else you pay peak power prices to have someone else supply the batteries to the grid), again making the rapids more expensive.

IMO there will always be a need for rapid chargers regardless of range. What if you get back from a long trip, your car is nearly empty and then you get a call from a family member that they need help... without a rapid charger on route you might not be able to do that trip. Also, a 400 mile car could require more than a single overnight to charge fully at normal household charge rates (7kW).

Also... it is common for those that have a fixed place of work to commute for 30 to 60 minutes each way, so a road warrior is often happy to extend the working day (including driving) to 9 or 10 hours. In fact, when I used to do travelling as part of my job it was not unusual to have much longer days!

Exactly - and my biggest EV bugbear is one of these too. Our second car is a diesel Skoda and we could easily swap it for a second-hand iMiev or similar except for one thing. It has a tow hitch.

That argument only works if you go on the basis that’s where you’d fuel your EV on a regular basis but that won’t be the case since it wouldn’t be economic even without such a tax. These will be occasional use, where they won’t make much difference to the overall cost of running the EV. Say once in a blue moon i pay 2x the cost of petrol, but 99% of the time I’m paying 1/4, that 2x is irrelevant. With enough passing traffic there will be enough once in a blue moon users to make it profitable for Shell at either price (if there isn’t, they will adjust the price until there is, or shut them down)

Longer term the government will have to  recoup the tax some way, but it’s unlikely it wil be  through this mechanism as it simply won’t raise enough, it addresses too small a proportion. By that time, whatever the mechanism is, we’ll be locked into BEVs

You have to include the monthly subscription in that comparison, and Chargemaster are banking on the fact that most of their users won't be doing a massive amount of charging each month so they can keep the subscriptions for the heavy users subsidised by the light users.

Provided the usage fees cover the cost of additional chargers on high usage sites, then high usage members may not be much of a problem.

bmw505,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"My V8 range rover runs on LPG and costs about 15p a mile at a guess (circa 15mpg and 50p a litre for gas). The A4 (petrol turbo) uses super unleaded and costs a bit more, maybe 18p or so.

I currently use the ICE when i'm doing longer journeys due to the standard EV range and charging issues. Plus the B250 doesnt rapid charge, but thats a side issue. If i'm doing a long journey, and having to put up with the inconvenience of stopping and charging, it needs to be cheaper than the ICE, by a decent margin.

My B250 averages 2.4mile/kwh (from the wall, which is what the pump is charging). Electricity at 8p a kwh means its costing me abour 3.5p a mile. Electricity at 49p a kwh means its costing me 20p a mile.

So clearly i'll be taking the V8.
					 "
bmw506,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"That would be so if you were paying 49p for all your charging but you wouldn't charge at Shell stations at 49p except when you needed to or if it was so much more convenient that you were prepared to pay it. So would you actually still take your V8 if you could charge at a much more sensible price for most of your trip with perhaps a single charge to bridge a gap at a Shell?

I think it isn't right to look at the price of charging without considering how often you might use it. If it is something you would use all the time then it  clearly must be at a price that makes sense for regular use but for occasional or emergency use then it would be cutting off your nose to spit your face (so to speak) when it would still be a lot cheaper overall to take the EV.

I do understand that with the B250 that decision is modified a lot by the inconvenience of no rapid charging and range but as you say... that is a side issue 
					 "
bmw507,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"i guess it depends on the journey as always. I commute 70odd miles a day in the b250. It works fine as i charge at work. On the other hand, i drove the B250 (rather carefully) to my mates house 60miles away at the weekend, arriving with around 30% battery and clearly needed a charge to get home. Luckily we were there for many hours and i simply plugged it in, but had the journey depended on a rapid charger that was going to cost me 49p a kwh, plus having to stop for a half hour on the way home, i'd clearly have taken one of the ICE cars instead.

The longer the journey gets the more times your relying on the expensive chargers, the worse the whole deal becomes.

If its your only car, then maybe it works out ok against the alternative of hiring an ICE, but that still doesnt change the fact that for me, its a ripoff and i wouldnt be using it.

The problem is that the additional costs involved in producing an EV pushes these cars out of range of what is considered normal or acceptable for a small car. The actual build costs of small and large cars are not that much different and most small cars are only marginally profitable anyway -- that's why so many of them are badge-engineered between brands in order to bring unit costs down.

The silly thing people do when they make comparisons with ICE cars, is they compare the figure they get from driving along like a nun, drafting lorries and never exceeding 55mph, with the figure the rep-mobile diesel achieves doing 80mph...

I dont think 4 or 5miles per kwh is realistic if you drive in a ""normal"" manner. Especially on motorways where the average speed can be closer to 80 in reality. Even the EPA range figures dont use a figure anywhere near that high.

Also, bear in mind the Merc figure is wall to wheel, rather than battery to wheel, which is different to most other EV's. The recon 20% difference, so 2.4 in the merc would show as close to 3 in most BEV's. For cost comparisons, the Merc figures are actually what you want to be using, as you dont pay for electricity coming out the battery, you pay for the electricity going into it.

True, but those inefficiencies are there for normal AC charging too (cooling maybe slightly cheaper, constant overheads for BMS having more effect when charging slower, so probably balancing out).  And the efficiency of the on-board charger is going to be very similar to the off-board one in a DC chargepoint.

So in either case the number of kWh to deliver a given amount of charge to the battery will be about 10% less if you measured the DC than if you measured the AC.

The on-board inefficiencies I have no argument about - as you say, once I've taken the energy it's down to me what the car then does with it.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if everybody is doing the same thing (per the fruity examples above), just like quoting prices with or without VAT.  We all know the VAT's got to be paid (or the mouldy apples thrown away), it's just a question of what basis the price is quoted on.

Right, but if you only plan to use Shell occasionally it could still work out cheaper than Polar subscription rates. It all comes down to where in the country you are, and where you might want to charge.

I just realised there's a Polar rapid on a route that I might reasonably want to use once or twice a month. 'Great' I thought, perhaps a reason for signing up. Then I realised it's one with a flat rate per use which I can already get without subscribing, so scratch that one off the list. I still have no Polar rapids that are anywhere I could reasonably expect to use, so there is no way (for me) that Polar makes sense. For many others whose journeys are slightly different it's a bargain.

Hi Duncan,
                  The 390 Volt will be the battery voltage at that particular state of charge. A low state of charge will be about 360 Volt. Then I think the chargers maximum current is the limiting factor (for DBT anyway). The spec calls up for 500 Volt max and 125 Amp max. The voltage when charging a battery is lower at a lower state of charge.  So as the charge progresses power increases due to the battery voltage rising and the current staying the same. So when I have charged on a DBT it always starts low 36 kW and ends up at 43-45 kW (usually at Lichfield).  The charger voltage will be the same as the battery voltage i.e. the charger outputs it's maximum current (usually) and the voltage is a function of that current and the battery characteristics (usually internal resistance). The voltage on the battery terminals and the voltage on the charger output will be practically the same.

My question is what would happen if the charger was unlimited and it was only the battery that controlled the current.

I have to say, they’re doing this properly. It was a prominent position near the back of the site visible as soon as you drive in with a very well marked bay so unlikely to be ICE’d. They’ve also fitted a motion activated LED floodlight above the parking bay so there’s no issues with lighting at night. A nice touch. 

The app was slightly fiddly the first time I used it as it directs to a site to input payment details. I’d much prefer it linked to my Apple Pay or took card so I’m looking forward to contactless. Once it got going the live charging summary was useful and it even provides the current speed information. 

The machine itself is spot on. I can’t imagine people will ever put the plugs back incorrectly. I was also getting a consistent 48kw which is higher than I’ve seen on other Chademo chargers I’ve used. 

I’d have no problems rolling up to these sites with only 2 miles left. It feels like it’s properly supported and the experience gave me a lot of confidence that they might actually be committed to this. 

As for the cost. I think the initial free charging periods on other networks have created an expectation that charging should be free or as cheap as the electricity at home. That’s never going to happen in the real world as these machines aren’t free! As long as it’s properly supported, as it seems to be, and continues to use modern, fast and reliable hardware it’s worth every penny. The blended cost of the journey when most charging is still done at home is still very low. And I’d prefer the cost is high to ensure people only use it when they really need must to increase availability.

 I think the expectation that charging an electric vehicle should be free has long since gone, if in fact it ever really existed. The main issue in the past has been whether or not public chargers had a fair tariff, which in the most part has been largely addressed now. What we want is a sensible, reliable, nationwide rapid charging infrastructure, not a free one.

Is that a hypothetical or is there one near Chersley? If so I missed it on Zap Map! In any case I'd probably still make a beeline for Shell. No one lingers at a petrol station longer than they absolutely have to so it's unlikely to be ICE'd and if anyone is already charging they're probably hanging around and available to ask how long they'll be. I don't like using chargers in car parks - they get full and people will park there for convenience and you can't track down the owner. I was on my way back from Bournemouth to Kent and every Chargernet rapid I tried to do some destination charging was ICE'd. Hence the Shell stop on my way home.

Once you've installed the app you can ""monitor"" charge points. If someone starts using it as you're en route it will flash up a notification so you're pre warned or can divert to an alternative. So at least the app does have some perks if it is a little fiddly. I didn't have any connectivity issues though and it remembered my session.

All of the Shell garages I've been in recently are pushing toward their app for Pay at Pump, so I'm not surprised they're doing the same for the EV chargers.

bmw571,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"On zap map last night there were a couple of users reporting that ecotricity at motorway services wasn't working so theyd gone to Shell and charged there (Shell Barnet  IIRC) making the point its all well and good wittering on about how ecotricity  are cheaper but if they dont charge enough to make it worthwhile them repairing their units in a timely manner, so what. 

Even if they work ""most"" of the time, after one or two failed experiences  I suspect many will prefer to factor in a reliable operation in their route and go there in the first place ... with one proviso, if you go to Shell and keep finding its in use because there is only one, that itsn't much different.

One charger per location seems like a poor strategy and why they are setting out like this seems strange, IMO they'd be better starting with 1/4 the locations and 4x the pumps so you are pretty much assured you can drive out of your way to them and find a spare charger, so they dont have a reputation of being ""BEV'd"" all the time?  I wonder if these are being planned and installed by shell people with no actual EV experience themselves?

+1 - I actively avoid sites with only one rapid. Too high a chance of it being ICEd/EVed/broken/in use. Despite their numerous, extensive and unforgivable faults, Ecotricity still get the bulk of my money for long distance travel, simply because there are two/three units at most locations and I'm 99% likely to be able to charge first time without a delay.

I have a Polar Plus card and was loving the roll-out of the new Ultrachargers. Finally an opportunity to move away from Ecotricity, I thought. Unfortunately I've only been able to charge on 2 out of 6 attempts because the chargers have been in use. A missed opportunity from Chargemaster there. I now don't bother with them - it's not worth my time detouring even slightly from my route to save a couple of quid, given there's a high chance of not being able to charge.

Shell should be installing at least two chargers at each location if they really want to compete, especially in their London locations where they're going to be frequently used by the new fleet of black cabs.

They can do AC & DC at the same time but that does mean AC users would have to park on the bay to the right of the charge bay not the charge bay so that the DC leads could be used easily so they an already cater for an AC and DC pair of cars charging at the same time.

But stating your anecdote doesn't discount mine. I find the single-unit Polar rapids to be used frequently and often hogged because of their locations and their low pricing. My most recent encounters were the Holiday Inn by the M6, where a BMW PHEV had been plugged in for over an hour (I continued to Corley, where both Ecotricity chargers were available and working), the Harvester in Didcot, which had a Leaf charging and an i3 waiting (proceeded to Chieveley where both chargers were working), Eveham Leisure Centre, which had a Zoe that had been plugged in for 45 minutes but the driver nowhere to be seen - presumably, 'leisuring' themselves! (I proceeded to Hopwood Park where Ecotricity was working - though to be fair I didn't have time to check the other pump but I assume it was working).

I accept that Ecotricity are slow to fix problems (in fact, I'm quite profuse about it) but two chargers at a site reduces charger anxiety massively and gives me a much higher chance of continuing my journey without issue/delay.

I'm sure we will end up with more chargers but it might not happen straight away.

Unless you own a Chademo connected car you've effectively only had one charger that you can use at most Ecotricity sites so one charger per location is much the same.

Taxi's are an interesting one, if there is a mass change to the range extender taxi's and queue's at chargers there will be enormous pressure to install more of them, they could provide the demand that charge point owners require to put in big investments. I wonder if we will end up with chargers at taxi ranks by stations and airports. A taxi driver will probably want to be plugged in if they are waiting for a fare.

There is - the Chargepoint Express Plus is modular, with the power equipment and buffer battery separate from the charge heads. Each system therefore can service multiple heads simultaneously. Instavolt have said that they're going to start installing these soon. Cahors/EVtronic also make a charger with an 18kWh buffer battery - this can be used to power a second 'satellite' charger. CPG are starting to install these, but without the second charger unfortunately. They're used quite a lot in France - see attached photo for one I used in the summer.

The Shell install is great news and I am glad that people are not moaning about the cost given the previous mammoth thread after EH introduced a fee for charging. Not cheap but if it is sustainable and the chargers can be well maintained then worth it. I can see it being a big hit in London with the phev taxis.

Regarding 2 chargers per location, nice to have but I would prefer twice as many charger locations  such as Norfolk, Wales and other areas lacking rapids. 

They could perhaps add a 3 pin, commando, or type 2 to each install that is kept in a locked box to be opened by the manager/staff if the rapid goes down and someone is desperate. Maybe charge £1 or 2 per hour for 3/7kw to get you on your way. It would be very cheap to add this to an install and make the locations a 100% guaranteed stop, even if you turn up in turtle mode. The above is assuming they will be installed to 24hr service stations. Sounds a bit heath robinson but would be vastly cheaper than a second rapid and would allow a quicker expansion of the network to more areas. Also if people know it is a 100% guaranteed charge location 24/7, then EV drivers are more likely to plan their journey via Shell without the need for all that plan B, C, D stuff.

I'm sure we will end up with more chargers but it might not happen straight away.Click to expand...
	
The problem with rolling out individual rapid chargers, as no charging operator seems to have realised yet, is that a single rapid charger on its own can't be relied upon, so people in real need will be reluctant to plan their journey to use it, and therefore gauging the ""demand"" using a single rapid charger at each site is a fools game.

You don't have to be bitten by arriving at a non functional, single solitary rapid charger more than a few times before you are wary of ever making out of range trips in an EV again.

There are numerous examples of people on this forum - who by being on this forum demonstrate more geeky interest in EV's than your average motorist will, who have the support mechanism of information and advice on this forum, know how to use zap-map and plugshare etc who still have decided that they will no longer attempt any out of range trips because they have been bitten one too many times by out of order rapid chargers. I think that is a sad state of affairs, but I don't blame them one little bit.

I'm as technical and nerdy an EV driver as you will find, I have a 60 mile range Ion and I will not make an out of range journey that relies on a particular rapid charger to be working where there are no Plan B alternatives.

The risk of arriving and finding no comms or a hardware fault is just too great to risk stranding my family (including a small child) there, and at the very least will be a complete day ruiner. I do have an AA membership but I am definitely not using that as my regular plan B!

The public need confidence in the charging network. They need to know that they can drive somewhere and expect A charger to be working without having to ""check ahead"" and cross their fingers and toes, if this doesn't happen, EV's are going to experience a major backlash once the unforgiving general motoring public tries to come on board.

The solution to this problem of ""confidence"" (or lack of) in public charging is very simple:

1) Free vend on comms lost must happen. No ifs, buts, maybes, and it needs legislation to enforce it. There should never, ever, be a situation where a paying customer who has arrived to charge cannot charge because of a loss of communication with the back end at the other end of the country, but the hardware on site has power and is otherwise working.

If there is a comms failure, that is the vendors fault, they need to stomach the cost of lost revenue or provide a way to do delayed transaction processing. I've seen all the arguments about how this is too hard or expensive to implement but I'm not interested. Make it happen before legislation makes you make it happen.

2) There should be a minimum of two rapid chargers at every location, primarily for hardware redundancy in the case of faults, but a nice side effect is that the chances of having to queue are greatly reduced, improving the user experience as well. When I pull up at a rapid charger I have two main fears - is it working ? And is it already in use by someone who is going to be there for a long time...(3rd being is it ICE'ed - but that hasn't happened to me yet)

The chances of two rapid chargers both being faulty, damaged, or stuck in emergency lockout at the same time statistically speaking is vanishingly small compared the chances of this being the case with one charger, and if both have free vend on comms loss the chance of arriving at a site and being unable to charge will be vanishingly small compared to what it is now.

I've only been driving an EV since February, I very rarely rapid charge but when I do I always live in fear of the charger being down or blocked, and in the 20 or so rapid charges I've done about 5 have been unsuccessful, and in all cases there was no redundant unit on site. Not good averages!

Now I grant that with the Shell chargers there are in store staff available to help with any problems such as resetting a unit (I hope ?) or lending a card if there is a comms problem, so that is a potential advantage, but if you arrive and find a broken plug lying on the ground, what realistically can minimum wage service station staff do to help with that ? Nothing, except book an engineer visit for the following day, which doesn't help you specifically.

If there was a redundant unit there, the day is saved and the motorist has confidence in the reliability of the charging network. Pretty simple really.

bmw612,Chargers at Shell petrol stations,"I attempted to use Shell Recharge at Willington, charge point number UKALLEGO000102, this evening but failed.
I have the Smoov app on my phone but was unable to get the app to recognise my location.
I tried pointing on the map, typing the name of nearest town and even manually typing the post number (where must leave out the last digit according to the advice from the help line.
I also tried to scan the QR code.
All I got was a message ""an error has ocurred"". I think I already knew that.
I tried the help line but they were unable to do much other than tell me what I already knew.
They were unable to start the charge from their end, unlike Ecotricity. 
I spent 20 minutes standing in the sleet trying to get a charge.
There is no shelter and only very poor lighting on the instructions.
QR code is difficult to scan as it is located behind the HT cable.
I am glad that I was only trying it out and had sufficient charge to get home.

What a shame it is when a big company like Shell installs an excellent piece of kit right where we need it, at a filling station, but it is let down by a needlessly complex system for starting and paying for a charge.

I wonder when they will think of the answer which is: ""Fill, up then go to the kiosk and pay with card or cash.""
It seems to work for petrol!

bmw623,InstaVolt to roll out 200 new rapids across UK,"I am really looking forward to these units - have you read up on the data? They use charging modules that each supply 31.25kW and they can be connected in various groups. A typical ""small"" combination is two linked chargers with two modules in each, allowing up to 125kW to a single vehicle or a spread of different power outputs to up to 4 vehicles - It looks like each charging station can supply two vehicles at once and they share their power modules between the two as required. Larger installations have one or more power cube that has 16 of the 31.25kW modules and a number of charging points that share the power from this 500kW cube. Max to a single vehicle is 400kW!

At £60K plus the i-Pace will give the Model S some competiton, which is good as it has got expensive in the UK. It is great to have more EV options - the i-Pace will suit a lot of buyers who want something smaller than the Model S but more practical than the Model 3. I suspect a high % of customers will keep a larger diesel for long journeys.

Baring exchange rate disaster, we know the Model 3 will be substantially cheaper and Tesla know the UK is a good opportunity for them, especially with forthcoming drops in EV BIK.

Our preference is to be ""EV only"" in 2019 so M3 is likely to be a better solution for us due to the SC network - particularly with ongoing improvements.  Of course if the i-Pace is a ""bargain"" we might get one and keep the Ampera - who knows

I agree units look good but a bit depressed that we are getting a new, rooky company who are going to deploy.

Lots of jobs on their web site so they are gearing up but (as said many times here) it is awfully difficult to make money with rapid chargers - look at the number who deserted EH once they had to pay!

Yes workers can pretty much be based anywhere. No need for one employee to sit there waiting for the occasional call. Probably less than £25/day to have a 24/7 phone hepline.

		I just used my burner account to get a quote.

A basic UK based answering service  is a about £350 a month for something like 250 minutes. (or was it 500)  Calls roll over to the US at night.   At this price, THey can take messages or orders but not follow a tech support script.

This would be enough to set up someone with an account or start a charge.  Real problems would have to be take a message and we will call you back.  The quote includes them sending a text message for any thing that needs a call back.


An Indian tech support centre is about $20 an hour.    I didn't get a quote.  There could be set up fees and the price could be higher for small customer.Click to expand...
	
Pretty cheap if the rapid charger calls are routed along with the other customer calls such as enrolling and general customer enquiries. I think most call centers are pretty flexible but at a price of course. Pretty easy to set up a text or even DTMF based server to reset chargers etc if that is usually done by a dedicated PC over the internet. The hope would be that Instavolt would follow the Tesla/Fastned way and have reliable chargers in Hubs that are monitored like the ABB chargers.  Then have quick repair times such that a customer is very unlikely to ever see a problem,

Anyway need rapid chargers in say star city,  small health etc.   With 24/7 but also one can argue (esp cause of costs) at least for now what's the need.  I mean there is a lot of destinations chargers esp in city centre (not including they might not be working 100% like at temple row that other problem) 

When u go to city centre to work / shop etc  u most often going to be for at least couple hours hence destination chargers are better.  Like instead of paying  £25k for one rapid at bull ring car park.  Use that same to fit 83 fast chargers in bull ring instead (which make ice much less of a problem and give many  points for many eV cars to use)

If they park at bull ring for couple hours should get a lot of charge back and if than need more charge on way home like Manchester say or Cardiff could stop on rapid enroute

I don't disagree with you (other than the fact there's waaaay too few destination chargers but that's off topic!)

However there's a vast difference between zero rapids and non-zero rapids.

You literally can't rapid charge your car anywhere in the second city, unless it's a leaf and unless you nicely ask them to move their various demo cars that they block the rapids with because they're obviously fed up of goodness knows how many thousands of leafs descending on them.

They're planning taxi EV points here although who knows if/when or how they'll mess it up. 

We've had quite a few posts on here where people have been trying to pass through or around the city and not found any rapid stops, usually when picking up their EV or similar.

Only if you can get many people using the charger.   But if you get many people using a single rapid charger, it becomes very likely the charger will be in use when someone arrives resulting in long queues.

But if you have double the number of people using two rapid chargers (at the same location) then the average queuing time more than halves.

The real money making comes when you can have at least 4 rapid charges at the same location with half of them in use most of the time – as you have very short queues (mostly no queues) to keep the customers happy and lots of income.   (Or you have rapids at a location where people are stopping for a short time and will charge if the rapid is free and their battery has the space, but are happy to not charge as they will be back before they need to charge, e.g taxi rank.)

having said that Renault have probably lost the battle and the next version of the ZOE should probably have CCS charging fitted as it allows higher power charging. Does anyone know if CCS allows 43kW 3 phase charging on the Type 2 part of the connector? We should really be moving towards a single standard, and to my mind that means CCS.

Not really.  Other cars have 43kW or more of regen without corresponding AC charge capability.

Re-using part of the drive electronics to achieve a large charger more cheaply involves some serious compromises; the version of the Zoe with 43kW charging achieves worse range than the version with 22kW charging (as acknowledged by Renault in the specs), and it seems quite likely that some of the other issues Zoes have had with charging (heavy powerline RF emissions, sensitivity to earth impedance) are due to their unconventional charger design.

Renault were not the first to try this trick: back in 1993 AC Propulsion patented a similar combined motor-drive/charger concept (they called it the ""Reductive Charger"") and later licensed it to Tesla for the Roadster.  However Tesla ran into similar problems to some of the issues with Zoe and decided that fixing the problems made it more expensive than just having a separate charger. Later builds of the Roadster switched to a separate charger, as have all subsequent Tesla vehicles.

At the car end, a CCS connector can certainly have 43kW AC as well as the extra contacts for DC.  On a chargepoint however, fitting the larger CCS connector (even if you populated it with all the pins) wouldn't fit in a car that only had the AC connector.  The CCS protocol does support what you want, it's just the physical size of the connectors that's an issue.

bmw720,InstaVolt to roll out 200 new rapids across UK,"I don't think it would be economically viable to retrofit a car with DC charging, but there is no reason why a new model can't devote a bit more space to fit a CCS connector.

If you look at the thread on the Zoe page the general consensus is that the new motor version car doesn't have as much extra range as Renault claim and some of that comes from using more of the capacity of the battery. There are efficiency problems when charging at low powers with the 43kW charger but for me I do the vast majority of my charging at 7kW or above where it isn't a big loss. Like any engineering there are compromises. I have not driven a new motor Zoe so can't confirm this myself.

I think the point is more the following (although I don't know of any 43kW AC-only chargers, so will need to be 22kW):
* Some Zoes can charge at 44kW from a rapid, but an increasing number are limited to 22kW
* A number of other makes can charge on the AC side of a rapid at 22kW (BYD and some Tesla for example)
* Even worse, there are loads of cars that can charge at less than 22kW on the AC side of a rapid, for example 16kW for modern Teslas, 11kW for Smart ED (I think) and newer BMW i3, 7kW for some other Type-2 BEVs, and all those plug-in hybrids that trickle 3kW on a rapid

No idea - but if they are buying rapid chargers by the hundred (which apparently they are!) they should be able to get one of the many 22kW charger manufacturers to add some sort of product to match the requirement.

A big part of the cost of the installation is the cost of cabling and getting a sufficiently rated supply to the site. If you have a combined charger you only need one supply, put in a separate 43kW AC charger and you double the installation cost, possibly increase it many times if you need to uprate the supply to the site. Just because DC is fitted to more cars doesn't mean that AC charging isn't just as rapid. If you used that logic we should probably drop either Chademo or CCS as one of them will eventually become dominant.

There have been many comparisons of charging standards with the VHS / Betamax home VTR format battle, VHS won through better marketing, not because it was superior. Both formats have now been displaced by newer technology. I suspect something similar will happen with chargers. There are already new incompatible connectors for Chademo and CCS which will support higher power charging. Should we drop 50kW DC charging as there is now another shiny new thing?

Depends on how the whole repair/maintenance system is designed. Very few repair/maintenance systems are designed because they are implemented by non technical folk who think ""just call an engineer when it's broke"" is the answer. And very few organisations put any money into availability or uptime and customer satisfaction. My take would be to have the maintenance organised properly. First response would be send technician same day to diagnose fault. 90% of these will be repairable by this  technician. If this is not possible then same day replacement of the charger would happen. Unit goes back to manufacturer to repair and update design so fault is less likely to happen in future. Design team gets record so next design does not have that fault. Training and expertise for the technician would need to be rigorous.

A bit worrying that different numbers are coming across. The 3000 was on the funders site, but the Instavolt man at the sharp end so to speak says 1000 over 3 years. I'm more likely to believe the 1000 . Even so until the chargers are up and running there is no certainty of course. But currently Zap Map is showing 32 Instavolt chargers currently active. Not sure when installations started but it looks like an average of about 1 rapid a day. This would be about 1000 over three years using fag packet maths. My hope is MSA's like the Instavolt Corley plan with 5/6 rapids each side of the motorway become the norm.

Very confusing I would say.  Maybe the origional pitch for funding mentioned one figure as possible and maybe the lower figure is what funding has actually been allocated. Without being closely involved in the company and the funders/backers we will never know. But the quote from the funders website says ""UK with an aim to exceed 3,000 locations by 2021""

All we actually know for sure is that ZapMap has 19 locations and 32 Instavolt rapids live so far. Evidence on the ground is that rapids have been installed but not yet commissioned. And that a lot of planning applications have been submitted with some already approved. I am not sure of ChargePoints exact involvement but they are a big company and have raised lots of capital. Daimler has also provided funds. It looks like they are committed and I hope they are in it for the long term.

As cities (like Oxford) introduce zero emission zones, there will be growing demand for low cost, used EVs to commute into work so I am confident the Zoe (even 22kW) will do OK on the used market..  

As is already happening in London (due to taxis), we will see more 22kW chargers which benefits the Zoe. I think we will see more models adding that feature, maybe as an option.  I am confident dual chargers will be a Model 3 option in UK and hope to get 3 phase at our next home .
