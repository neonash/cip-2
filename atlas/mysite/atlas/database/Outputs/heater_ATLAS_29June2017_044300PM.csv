 ,Stiebel Eltron,heater,"Stiebel Eltron’s elegant surface-mount CK heater is perfect anywhere quick heat is needed. Designed and made in Germany, this quiet fan heater quickly warms an area or maintains a comfortable temperature. Perfect for both retrofit and new construction, the European downdraft design heats a space evenly. CK heaters easily replace older flush-mount heaters and are ideal for bathrooms, basements, offices, playrooms, 3-season porches, cabins, campers or RVs, and mobile homes. The built-in fan is extremely quiet in operation at only 49.7 dBA. A thermostat with an adjustable knob for setting temperature is located on the right side of the CK. In rooms larger than 215 sq. ft., the CK can be operated through a conventional wall-mounted room thermostat. The CK is designed with a frost-protection setting. The lowest thermostat setting will maintain above-freezing temperatures in an appropriately sized space. The external casing is made of stove-enameled sheet steel. The sides are made from plastic. The CK heater is designed to have its components recycled at the end of its useful life. Stiebel Eltron is a world-leading German manufacturer of technically sound products since 1924.
CK 15E is 120-Volt, outputs 1500-Watt, draws 12.5 Amp, and must be hardwired
CK 15E needs a 15 Amp breaker and 12 AWG wire
Heat output for the CK 15E is 5122 BTU/hr.
Galvanized steel, squirrel cage blower motor is extremely quiet, with a noise level of only 49.7 dBA

I use it in the bathrooms of my cabin where the temperatures can be below freezing during winter months. I like that it has an automatic anti-freeze setting built in to keep my bathrooms pipes from freezing. My wife likes that we can set the thermostat at night and close the door to the bathrooms and it keeps them warm for middle of the night visits. This is the second unit by this mfg. that I have purchased. The first had the timer function but we never use it so I opted for the unit with just the thermostat at a slightly lower cost.,CK 15E Wall-Mounted Electric Fan Heater review,http://www.homedepot.com/p/Stiebel-Eltron-CK-15E-Wall-Mounted-Electric-Fan-Heater-CK-15E/204091958,Mark,heater_Stiebel Eltron_204091958_Mark_114_597, , ,HD, 
 ,Stiebel Eltron,heater,"Stiebel Eltron’s elegant surface-mount CK heater is perfect anywhere quick heat is needed. Designed and made in Germany, this quiet fan heater quickly warms an area or maintains a comfortable temperature. Perfect for both retrofit and new construction, the European downdraft design heats a space evenly. CK heaters easily replace older flush-mount heaters and are ideal for bathrooms, basements, offices, playrooms, 3-season porches, cabins, campers or RVs, and mobile homes. The built-in fan is extremely quiet in operation at only 49.7 dBA. A thermostat with an adjustable knob for setting temperature is located on the right side of the CK. In rooms larger than 215 sq. ft., the CK can be operated through a conventional wall-mounted room thermostat. The CK is designed with a frost-protection setting. The lowest thermostat setting will maintain above-freezing temperatures in an appropriately sized space. The external casing is made of stove-enameled sheet steel. The sides are made from plastic. The CK heater is designed to have its components recycled at the end of its useful life. Stiebel Eltron is a world-leading German manufacturer of technically sound products since 1924.
