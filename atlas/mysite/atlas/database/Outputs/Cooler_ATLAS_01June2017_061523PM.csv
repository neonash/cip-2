I love that you can use the removable liner separately. we took it on our trip and used the liner for the pantry-type snacks, and used the cooler for cold drinks and snacks. kept everything cool for a 9 hour road trip! I just dont like the handles on the removable liner because they are so ""sharp"". I wrapped tape around them so i could carry it without feeling like it's going to cut my fingers off. Maybe if they added some padding or something around the handles, that would be great. but simple fix for me so i dont mind, worth the money!",this is the BEST cooler ever,https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-16-Can-Cooler-Gray/product-reviews/B006HFBNYO/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Tiffany,Cooler_Coleman_B006HFBNYO_Tiffany_112_582, , ,AM,

I was looking for a smaller beach cooler for when we want to bring lunch and drinks. I've used a larger hard cooler for years and was looking for something lighter with a shoulder strap. I think for the price, this is a great buy. I like that you can remove the hard liner if you need more space. With the hard liner, I would say you can fit about 8 bottles or 10-12 cans, plus some other items like sandwich. The extra space at the top means you can fit some extra items in there which is a plus.
