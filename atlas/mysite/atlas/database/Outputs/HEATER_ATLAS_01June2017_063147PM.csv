Ive put it through total heck. And its still going. We use it everywhere. Our popup camper is the biggest work for it. 10 degrees out. And this thing ran 4 days straight and didn't melt. Didn't get a hot cord. And still works after every time we do this to it. The front of it does have some white on the black area as other pictures show. But the heat is going to do something to a unit. Its not a concern at all. Not like its melting or something. And now I'm looking for a smaller unit that may only use 1100 watts. But I trust none. Probably will just end up buying another one of these units. Also It has a 16 gauge wire factory on it. Yet for 1500 watts I would recommend it should have been 14 gauge at least. How can they say don't put it on a extensor cord or a power adapter. yet they put it on a 16 gauge wire. My unit is the first gen. I notice the remote is only difference to mine. And mine does not have fall over protection. It will just keep running. Lucky I have no kids. But stuff can still happen. Also It has a high and low. But to have auto temp it has to be on high. when setting is on low it is always on and never shuts off.,5 year review,https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-751320-Ceramic-Heater-Control/product-reviews/B000TTSXNI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,dkce,HEATER_Lasko_B000TTSXNI_dkce_246_1186, , ,AM,

In the winter, it's unbearable to work without a heater. Not spending a lot of money was also a big priority for finding a heater. I was a bit sceptical when it first arrived - it looks cheap and has a plastic smell, and well, it's undeniably small. However, after 12 hours of leaving the Lasko on medium heat to warm up my studio, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had heated the 650 sqft space enough that I took off my sweater (woooaaa). And it kept it warm overnight (I left it on low). The days when I came into a completely cold room, it took the Lasko about 45 min - 1 hour to heat up, which isn't bad in my book (especially during these cold Wisconsin winters).

If you're looking to stretch your dollar far and get warm for the least amount of money, this is a great buy. One star is deducted because if you knock the heater over it doesn't shut off.
