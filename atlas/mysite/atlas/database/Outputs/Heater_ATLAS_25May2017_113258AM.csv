The oscillating feature distributes the heat evenly so there are no ""cold spots"" in the room. This isn't just an/off type heater. There are several choices for heating - Hi/Low fan, oscillate, no fan, thermostat, and timer. It's also very quiet. I ran out of heating oil and was very worried about being cold. This heater is not only efficient, it's given me peace of mind.

It does a superb job! I am disabled, so the remote control is a very handy feature. Its relatively quiet and does not bother me when i watch tv. The real test will come later on when the temperature drops around 0 degrees. I suspect that it will do fine. This heater had a high review rating, and my buying decision depends a lot on these reviews.I like the idea of the fan shutting off after it reaches a preset temp.The power cord is ample long enough for my needs.The heater works well on the floor as the digital reading can be seen easily. The heater can be placed on a table but the higher up you place it. the harder it is to read the temperature as the readouts are on top. With the heater set on automatic, using the remote its easy to drop or raise the temperature even when i'm half asleep and in the dark. This is a very well made heater and i would very highly recommend it to anyone who wants a durable heater that should last a very long time.","I use this heater in a small room (8' x 12').
