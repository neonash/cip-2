I had never heard of a Blu phone until someone told me (from a T-Mobile store actually) that I should get one because it is cheap. I don't care for the Galaxy S8 and I wanted to wait for the Note 8. So I took a chance and bought this phone primarily because of so many positive reviews.

Advantages:
Cheap phone but quality build (metal), up to date software, good enough camera, and good enough sound

Disadvantages:
Screen brightness is weak, color quality is not very good, not the fastest phone, a few random restarts, not as many settings as a premium phone.

So far I really like the phone and would like to give it 4.5/5 stars rather than 4. It does everything I need a temporary phone to do and thats about it. Don't expect to be wowed when you receive this phone if you are like me. However, you will be surprised of how good it is compared to the price.

Unfortunately the major downsides are the brightness and color quality. It isn't a deal breaker in any way but the screen is dim and impossible to see in sunlight. In a shadow or dark room you are fine but it is noticeable when coming from a premium phone. The color is WAY OFF and clearly wrong. Blacks are not truly black and colors are not crisp and sharp but dull and ugly. Also, the sound quality isn't the greatest. It sounds muffled in everything except for phone calls.

I have had the phone for about 2.5 weeks now and I have already noticed it slowing down when I am doing anything from swiping to texting to loading an app. It doesn't happen all the time but it has happened. There have been a few times where I have waited 15 to 30 seconds for the phone to catch up. I only hope it doesn't get any worse, I only need the phone to last me maybe 6 months.

Overall the phone is a great phone for anyone that is not heavily into premium phones. But once you have used one you definitely would not want to stay with this forever. I don't like buying cheap electronics but this phone with some upgrades could easily be made into a premium phone.","Cheap phone, but not you get more then you pay for!",https://www.amazon.com/BLU-R1-HD-Exclusive-Lockscreen/product-reviews/B01H2E0J5M/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Taylor Huddlestun,phone_BLU_B01H2E0J5M_Taylor Huddlestun_390_2087, , ,AM,

It's only a tad more expensive but the performance is like night and day.

My one gripe is the lock screen ads. I don't mind ad notifications. I'd happily have an ad pop up in my notices. But I hate lock screens. On every device I own I disable the lock screen. I wanna push a button and have the phone READY. I do not like it when it makes me go through any additional steps before I can use it. How many of us have unlocked a phone and forgotten what we were going to do? It's happened to me more than once and it is aggravating.

I had never heard of a Blu phone until someone told me (from a T-Mobile store actually) that I should get one because it is cheap. I don't care for the Galaxy S8 and I wanted to wait for the Note 8. So I took a chance and bought this phone primarily because of so many positive reviews.

Advantages:
Cheap phone but quality build (metal), up to date software, good enough camera, and good enough sound

Disadvantages:
Screen brightness is weak, color quality is not very good, not the fastest phone, a few random restarts, not as many settings as a premium phone.

So far I really like the phone and would like to give it 4.5/5 stars rather than 4. It does everything I need a temporary phone to do and thats about it. Don't expect to be wowed when you receive this phone if you are like me. However, you will be surprised of how good it is compared to the price.

Unfortunately the major downsides are the brightness and color quality. It isn't a deal breaker in any way but the screen is dim and impossible to see in sunlight. In a shadow or dark room you are fine but it is noticeable when coming from a premium phone. The color is WAY OFF and clearly wrong. Blacks are not truly black and colors are not crisp and sharp but dull and ugly. Also, the sound quality isn't the greatest. It sounds muffled in everything except for phone calls.

I have had the phone for about 2.5 weeks now and I have already noticed it slowing down when I am doing anything from swiping to texting to loading an app. It doesn't happen all the time but it has happened. There have been a few times where I have waited 15 to 30 seconds for the phone to catch up. I only hope it doesn't get any worse, I only need the phone to last me maybe 6 months.

Overall the phone is a great phone for anyone that is not heavily into premium phones. But once you have used one you definitely would not want to stay with this forever. I don't like buying cheap electronics but this phone with some upgrades could easily be made into a premium phone.","Cheap phone, but not you get more then you pay for!",https://www.amazon.com/BLU-R1-Cell-Phone-16GB/product-reviews/B01H2E0KVA/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Taylor Huddlestun,phone_BLU_B01H2E0KVA_Taylor Huddlestun_390_2087, , ,AM,

I wanna push a button and have the phone READY. I do not like it when it makes me go through any additional steps before I can use it.

Love the flexibility. Slightly misleading to say that it can be mounted on curved surfaces. I have a slanted, slightly curved portion of my 2014 CR-V dash where I had wanted to mount this holder, but the gel pad would never stick, no matter what. Ended up having to mount it low on the windshield, which seems to be working ok. It's a little further from me than I'd like, but not too bad. My only other comment is that I have one of those wallet pouches on the back of my phone case to hold credit cards and ID cards, which makes the phone a little bulkier. I find that for that reason, the side arms don't grip the sides of the phone as tightly as they might otherwise. It doesn't take much pressure from me to dislodge the phone from the holder. However, it's not a problem when I'm driving since I'm not handling my phone, then. So far it stays in place while driving, which is the important part. Am glad I got it and would recommend on the whole.","Slightly misleading to say that it can be mounted on curved surfaces, but good product overall.",https://www.amazon.com/iOttie-Holder-iPhone-Samsung-Galaxy/product-reviews/B00JRGOKQ8/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,MC,phone_iOttie_B00JRGOKQ8_MC_185_967, , ,AM,

Size is good and fairly compact. The one thing I dislike however is the charge indicator light. This model uses lights that illuminate the end cap like a ring and supposed to tell you, based on what portion of the ring is blinking, at what level the charger is at. The problem is that the light illuminates the entire end cap making it very difficult to know what the level is. The whole thing appears to flash.

I waited in suspense for the item to arrive, and it did! Right on time! Upon coming home and finding the phone plugged in and charging (I asked my mom to set that up before I got home from school so I could mess around with it when I got home), I was surprised to find that the screen and camera both still had the covers that usually come with a brand new phone. This phone has NO cosmetic damage whatsoever! It looks, and acts brand new!

As many others struggled with, I had a problem activating it with Straight Talk. The problem did not persist for long though. I called the company and activated the sim card I got from ST, and after that the talk and text part worked. I still couldn't fix the data part. During the hour I sat on hold with ST, I was able to simply look up a few different APN settings and enter them until I found one that works. I changed the carrier to AT&T in the settings, instead of Verizon, and that happened to fix part of my problem! After doing that, I found APN settings that worked for the phone until I finally got a signal for data. :D

The one odd thing about this phone (and I don't know if it is the same for all phones from this seller--so don't rely solely on my word), is that after the data was working it showed an H or H+ where it would usually show the 3G or 4G symbol. However, after some research, I found that this doesn't hinder the data usage of the phone at all, it actually makes it faster, if anything. It's speeds are right between 3G and 4G speeds. :)

Anyways, aside from that, I have had no other problems with the phone. :) I'm extremely happy with my purchase. After reading the 50/50 reviews, I can't tell if I was just one of the lucky ones, or if others are simply incompetent when it comes to technology.",) I'm extremely happy with my purchase,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Verizon-Wireless-Smartphone/product-reviews/B00YVVE7YO/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Amazon Customer,phone_Samsung_B00YVVE7YO_Amazon Customer_375_1969, , ,AM,

The screen began to crack immediately after purchase without dropping or any misuse. Even inside of a really strong case it continues to crack. I don't know if when they refurbish these, they replace with thinner or cheaper glass? I called immediately and was told by seller that this was a Samsung issue even though it was a certified refurbished. Samsung informed me that they were currently not able to honor any warranty work due to the ""current environment"" whatever that meant. Aside from the cracked screen, which I realize is hard to prove, the phone has so many functionality issues. It freezes constantly and will do some very annoying things. It sometimes freezes when I answer a call and puts the phone on speaker phone. It's frozen after I sent a text and when it unfroze it had sent audio to the person I just texted. Imagine that! This thing is terrible. I've nearly emptied the phone's memory hoping that would help but it does not and I've installed all of the updates. This thing has never worked correctly and now just a few months after purchase I have to purchase another phone.",Not a good purchase,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Verizon-Wireless-Smartphone/product-reviews/B00YVVE7YO/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Amazon Customer,phone_Samsung_B00YVVE7YO_Amazon Customer_202_1143, , ,AM,

First of all I want to point out I didn't buy this through Amazon but at Walmart, but I want to give customers a warning, this thing is cheap junk. Have you ever bought something so bad you'd almost swear it was on purpose? If you haven't, don't do it now! I first got it thinking, ""finally a smart phone that is affordable with a pay-go plan that I'm not a monthly slave to!"" How misguided my enthusiasm was, I basically bought a paper weight. The whole way the thing is set up is convoluted and not intuitive and user friendly at all, it took me about a month to figure out the awkward set up unlike the Galaxy which is easy to use and seamless. Second of all, many apps aren't compatible with this device so you can't get them. If you want to download something that doesn't already come with the thing, good luck, chances are it won't work. It also is crap if you want to use the internet, the setup for browsing and using social media is primitive and clunky. You cannot simply block any calls or texts from solicitors, you have to call service and go through their system... so I'd get junk calls and texts nonstop despite having a brand new number and there was nothing I could do about it. Most importantly, after only three months of owning it the whole screen and bottom icons stopped responding to touch making it completely unusable! No calls could be taken... it couldn't even be turned off. I had to wait for the battery to run down and then recharge to get the screen to work again, and that even doesn't always work, it would go back to not working. Obviously the thing is not only incompatible with even the most basic apps out there but its functionally defective and broke down before I ever even had a chance to drop it. I don't know what cheap knockoff technology they used but whatever it is it barely works, my advice would be to pass on this phone and buy something a bit better. This is a throwaway and replace device if ever there was one.",The Phone that was Designed not to Work:,https://www.amazon.com/Tracfone-Alcatel-Onetouch-Glitz-A463BG/product-reviews/B017LDNLIG/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Xisqu,phone_Tracfone_B017LDNLIG_Xisqu_373_1987, , ,AM,

Much less expensive per month, too, for the same portfolio of features. Ooma customer service is in CA, not oerseas like Vonage. ITP was serviced from NY, but they always wanted me to fix problems by opening ports on my router. (Can you say ""opened up for a hack attack""?)

Voice quality is much better than other VoIP services I've had including AT&T service at my AZ house that I really liked until they discontinued it. Doesn't seem to have the call drop or ""lose audio path in one direction"" issues I had with ITP's Cisco box and service. Telo unit seems to run much cooler than ITP's or AT&T's did. That may have been the source of my audio problems on ITP.

I'd call it on par with my free Google Phone service with my Obihai 200 box. Google Voice for free, however, is NOT as feature rich as Ooma Telo.

Lastly, you can only access certain features when using Ooma's own flavor of DECT 6.0 handsets (VM monitoring away from the Telo unit, VM interrupt, and 2nd call out line number when main line is in use.) I can live with that for now.

Bought the unit with the combo Bluetooth/WiFi dongle. It worked great using that, but the voice quality is better when in between cable modem and router using CAT5/6 cabling. In that mode the Ooma box uses the bandwidth it needs for top notch audio quality and lets the other devices on the network get what bandwidth is remaining (which happens to really be most of the BW). This way, the Ooma Telo is not throttled or choked by someone (my son) downloading a huge file whilst I'm trying to talk on the phone. The dongle is a nice accessory for when I might have to take the Telo with me on a trip, and keep my phone number with me at a hotel at which I might be staying.

Ooma security add-on's for home protection from break-in or water in the basement are cheap at the price compared to monthly security monitoring, and connect nicely to a smartphone. (I can call the cops myself if there is a problem with the ""perimeter being breached"". I don't need to pay a monolithic corporation more than $30 a month for monitoring.)

Ooma Telo also connects like a fax line without paying extra.

Pros: Package arrived in a timely manner. Was easy to install and the instructions were clear. The product looks nice, was easy to connect to the home phone network and had it working with my existing wireless phone in a matter of minutes.

Cons: International voice quality and connectivity is very poor. Calls and quality to multiple locations in India was very poor and numerous times the calls dropped and had to be retried. I did check QOS recommendations and set it to the max allowed but it made no difference.

I had high hopes and was really looking forward to saving $$ by switching from Vonage but have decided to go back.

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions. Tony Reinke’s reflections on the smartphone offer helpful advice as to how people today need to be vigilant regarding the impact of their favorite new technologies.”
—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”
—Jackie Hill Perry, poet; writer; hip-hop artist

“In contrast to the television that dominates the modern living room, the smartphone is typically far less conspicuous in its presence. Perhaps on account of this subtle unobtrusiveness, surprisingly few have devoted sustained reflection to the effect this now ubiquitous technology is having on our lives. In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”
—Alastair J. Roberts, theologian; blogger

“Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is one of the most important little books a twenty-first-century Christian could read. Highly recommended.”
—Bruce Riley Ashford, Provost and Associate Professor of Theology and Culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

“For many, the phone is an object of increasing anxiety, exhaustion, and dependency. The wise Tony Reinke leads us practically to find freedom from the phone without requiring us to huddle away in a monastery somewhere in the middle of Montana. If you want to know how to steward your technology and your life for Christ and his kingdom, read this.” 
—Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention

“If you feel uneasy about your constant relationship with your phone (and even if you don’t, but wonder if you should), you will find Tony Reinke to be a reliable guide for how we should assess the impact of our phones on ourselves and our relationships. A marvelous book that tackles a massive subject in clear and compelling language!”
—Trevin Wax, Managing Editor, The Gospel Project; author, Gospel-Centered Teaching, Counterfeit Gospels, and Holy Subversion

“Two things strike me about this book. First, Reinke writes with great humility, including himself in the narrative to help us see him not only as a teacher but also as a fellow struggler. Second, this is not a guilt-ridden slog through what not to do. Tony keeps pulling us up into the glories of Christ and even helps us to dream of new ways to glorify God through our digital technologies. Helpful, hopeful, humbling, and inspiring, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a book for this age and wisdom for generations to follow.” 
—Trillia Newbell, author, Enjoy; Fear and Faith; and United

“Image is everything, and for a woman who has built her identity on the sands of how she’s embraced online, the eventual letdown will come like a crash. But there’s a better way forward, a way to use our phones in selfless service, to glorify God in our connectivity, and to image Christ by our phone behaviors. For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”
—Gloria Furman, author, The Pastor's Wife; Missional Motherhood; and Alive in Him 

“As a teenager and a smartphone user, I needed this book. Tony Reinke is compelling and convicting, yet continually meets us with grace. My generation needs this book, because we need to get technology right. If we don’t, the cost is great. 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You should be a must-read for every smartphone user, especially for us younger ones.”
—Jaquelle Crowe, lead writer and Editor in Chief, TheRebelution.com; contributor, The Gospel Coalition; author, This Changes Everything

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands. Yes, our phones have changed us for the worse, but this book will change us and our phone use for the better.”
—David Murray, pastor, Grand Rapids Free Reformed Church; professor of Old Testament and practical theology, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary; author, Jesus on Every Page and Reset

“The more widespread and influential something is, the more Christians should think carefully about it. In this wisdom-filled book, Tony Reinke helps us do just that with the smartphone. Without descending into technophobia or paranoia, he shows the various ways in which phones are changing our lives, highlighting both the problems with this and the solutions to it. A timely and thoughtful book.”
—Andrew Wilson, pastor, Kings Church Eastbourne, East Sussex; author, If God, Then What? and Unbreakable

“Rarely is a book as practically impactful as it is theologically rich. In an age in which daily we are drawn into a digital vortex, Tony Reinke warns of the implications and challenges us to examine whether our phones have displaced our spiritual priorities in Christ. With unflinching honesty, Reinke shares his own technological struggles, and in so doing, moves us to a posture of reflection, prayer, and even repentance. Thoroughly engaging and immediately applicable, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a must-read for our time.”
—Kim Cash Tate, author, Cling: Choosing a Lifestyle of Intimacy with God

About the Author
Tony Reinke is a journalist and senior writer for desiringGod.org. He is the author of Lit!: A Christian Guide to Reading Books; Newton on the Christian Life; and 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You.

John Piper (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and the chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for 33 years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than 50 books, including Desiring God, Don’t Waste Your Life, This Momentary Marriage, A Peculiar Glory, and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.",#,1433552434,4.7,12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/dp/1433552434/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&qid=1496404584&sr=8-56&keywords=phone,phone_#N/A_1433552434,#N/A,2017-06-01 00:00:00,5.0,"If there is any one icon of our modern age, it would be the ubiquitous cell-phone. Not too long ago, we have credit card companies like American Express whose catchy advertisement says: ""Don't leave home without it."" Now, we cannot leave our homes without our phones with us. Some people would even drive all the way back from work when they realize they had left their phones at home. It has become our scheduler, daytimer, our work device, our home appliance, our online radio, our social media outlet, our camera, our notebook, our key way of communications, and many more. Yet, there are risks with regard to its use. This book demonstrates to us that there are at least 12 ways that we are being changed by this little device. Like a small rudder that turns a large ship, the little cell-phone can turn even the toughest human being. In the foreword to this book, John Piper declared that ""smartphones are dangerous"" simply because it can become an idol. The famous media critic, Marshall McLuhan asserts that technology, which includes smartphones are essentially extensions of oneself. Jacques Ellul warns us about the unpredictability of these new innovations while Oliver O'Donavan reminds us to be aware of the more important things BEFORE the proliferation of the smartphone. While some medical professionals may focus on the dangerous effects of radiation from the phone, Reinke looks from a lifestyle angle. Spurred by critical analyses from Oliver O'Donavan, Jacques Ellul, and Marshall McLuhan, the author approaches smartphones from a measured angle, not taking extreme views of either good or bad. Specifically, he asks: ""What is the best use of my smartphone in the flourishing of my life?"" He calls readers to re-examine the ways they are using the phone. He maintains that he is also writing for himself. That is true because the smartphones have affected most people on this planet. It is rare to ever find anyone without a cellphone these days.

Reinke brings in nine key realities from the Bible. Technology is a principality that modifies creation. It can improve life but it does not eradicate the brokenness of the world due to sin. It can be used for good as well as for evil. It empowers us and it can also be used to subvert others. Most importantly, technology shapes our theology. In order to ensure that we control technology before it controls us, we need to be aware of the 12 insidious ways the phone can change us.
Distraction: Reinke gives us ten ways to diagnose our condition.
Ignoring Our Conscience: How we are becoming disembodied in our everyday behaviours, and overestimating our own capabilities.
Instant Gratification: Beware the temptations of self-glorification and constantly seeking approval from others.
Lower Literacy: How smartphone usage has affected our reading habits
Consumerism: The age of the mediated self where we point, shoot, and forget.
Becoming what we 'liked': we fall in love with ourselves and our actions prove it.
Loneliness: Inability to preserve our solitude leads to isolation.
Secrecy: How we hide ourselves behind anonymity.
Meaninglessness: Need to rise above the oceans of passivity and egoism, to look at the eternal values of God.
Fear of Missing Out: Inability to deal with being left out.
Online Harshness: How personal information can be manipulated and abused; how a pessimistic culture can find reasons to dampen people's others.
Losing Our Place in Time: addiction to breaking news, and how we unwittingly allow social media to define us.
In each of the chapters, Reinke gives us diagnostic questions, critical statements, and reminders from the Bible that we are more than what the cellphone tells us. Toward the end of the book, he provides readers with concise summaries and possible antidotes against the negative effects of the smartphone use on us. He raises some thoughts about spirituality which really hits home. For instance, Reinke notes: ""In our love of mechanisms, techniques, and power, we lose our way - and we lose our worship and our prayer, because God has grown secondary to our technology."" This describes concisely what the uncritical use of the smartphone could do to our spiritual lives. Are we using the device or is the device using us? We need to ask ourselves about what the phone is doing to us? Technology has a lot of good we can use. There are also downsides. Some would even praise the phone so much that they become blind to any negative comments about the phone. It has become an addiction that many cannot part with. Denzel Washington in an interview with BBC has also warned us about it. What is the phone doing to us?

With this book, Reinke helps us to cover a lot of angles. Many of the warnings stem from a spiritual perspective, about how the use of the smartphone has driven us away from God in some way. Anything that does not push us closer to God is a form of idolatry. Uncritical use could lead us to be numb to the ordinary things of God. We prefer to take selfies or phone pictures instead of letting our eyes admire and enjoy the creation of God. When this happens, we lose an opportunity to appreciate God's creation for itself, choosing to be content with storing the magnificent scenes in some temporal digital image. Moreover, digital images do get corrupted or lost for various reasons. In our world of photoshop and image editing tools, it is so easy to make something authentic into a false image. Perhaps, this is a metaphor for how we treat God. By preferring the things of man instead of God Himself, we have chosen to worship the created instead of the Creator. We have opted for the gifts instead of the Giver. We have chosen foolishly, exchanging God for the images of the world. If there is one reason to read this book, it is to be rudely awakened to the dangers of uncritical smartphone usage. It would be impossible to abandon the phone altogether. The next best thing is to develop a strategy to rein in the tentacles of influence and to discipline ourselves to limit our use of the smartphone and to do so wisely. We need to move from wander to wonder; from browse to read; from addiction to restriction; and many more counter-smartphone moves. The more we find ourselves unable to part with our devices, the more this book is for us.

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands. Yes, our phones have changed us for the worse, but this book will change us and our phone use for the better.”
—David Murray, pastor, Grand Rapids Free Reformed Church; professor of Old Testament and practical theology, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary; author, Jesus on Every Page and Reset

“The more widespread and influential something is, the more Christians should think carefully about it. In this wisdom-filled book, Tony Reinke helps us do just that with the smartphone. Without descending into technophobia or paranoia, he shows the various ways in which phones are changing our lives, highlighting both the problems with this and the solutions to it. A timely and thoughtful book.”
—Andrew Wilson, pastor, Kings Church Eastbourne, East Sussex; author, If God, Then What? and Unbreakable

“Rarely is a book as practically impactful as it is theologically rich. In an age in which daily we are drawn into a digital vortex, Tony Reinke warns of the implications and challenges us to examine whether our phones have displaced our spiritual priorities in Christ. With unflinching honesty, Reinke shares his own technological struggles, and in so doing, moves us to a posture of reflection, prayer, and even repentance. Thoroughly engaging and immediately applicable, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a must-read for our time.”

About the Author
Tony Reinke is a journalist and senior writer for desiringGod.org. He is the author of Lit!: A Christian Guide to Reading Books; Newton on the Christian Life; and 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You.

John Piper (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and the chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for 33 years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than 50 books, including Desiring God, Don’t Waste Your Life, This Momentary Marriage, A Peculiar Glory, and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.",#,1433552434,4.7,12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/dp/1433552434/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&qid=1496404584&sr=8-56&keywords=phone,phone_#N/A_1433552434,#N/A,2017-05-30 00:00:00,4.0,"Well, if you weren't already convicted by how much time you spend on your smartphone, you will be after reading this book! The pros and cons of technology are discussed, particularly when it comes to our use of social media. The author asks some hard-hitting questions and talks about reasons we use our smartphones, things such as distraction and to avoid responsibility, for diversion, for affirmation and community.
""The question of this book is simple: What is the best use of my smartphone in the flourishing of my life? To that end, my aim is to avoid both extremes..."" The author gives both downsides and upsides to our use of smartphones. It appears the intent of the book is to open our eyes to why we are using them and for what purposes. We need to be intentional in the decisions we make and the author reminds us that we will answer to God for our words and deeds. He does not tell us we shouldn't use social media or smartphones, but rather to gauge our use and motivations for use and to be wise with our time and resources. ""Before you text, tweet, or publish digital art online, honestly ask yourself: Will this ultimately glorify me or God?""
In a world that speeds by us, this book is a good reminder of what matters and to remember what is truly important. Are we living life for God's purposes or our own?

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions. Tony Reinke’s reflections on the smartphone offer helpful advice as to how people today need to be vigilant regarding the impact of their favorite new technologies.”
—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”
—Jackie Hill Perry, poet; writer; hip-hop artist

“In contrast to the television that dominates the modern living room, the smartphone is typically far less conspicuous in its presence. Perhaps on account of this subtle unobtrusiveness, surprisingly few have devoted sustained reflection to the effect this now ubiquitous technology is having on our lives. In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”
—Alastair J. Roberts, theologian; blogger

“Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is one of the most important little books a twenty-first-century Christian could read. Highly recommended.”
—Bruce Riley Ashford, Provost and Associate Professor of Theology and Culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

“For many, the phone is an object of increasing anxiety, exhaustion, and dependency. The wise Tony Reinke leads us practically to find freedom from the phone without requiring us to huddle away in a monastery somewhere in the middle of Montana. If you want to know how to steward your technology and your life for Christ and his kingdom, read this.” 
—Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention

“If you feel uneasy about your constant relationship with your phone (and even if you don’t, but wonder if you should), you will find Tony Reinke to be a reliable guide for how we should assess the impact of our phones on ourselves and our relationships. A marvelous book that tackles a massive subject in clear and compelling language!”
—Trevin Wax, Managing Editor, The Gospel Project; author, Gospel-Centered Teaching, Counterfeit Gospels, and Holy Subversion

“Two things strike me about this book. First, Reinke writes with great humility, including himself in the narrative to help us see him not only as a teacher but also as a fellow struggler. Second, this is not a guilt-ridden slog through what not to do. Tony keeps pulling us up into the glories of Christ and even helps us to dream of new ways to glorify God through our digital technologies. Helpful, hopeful, humbling, and inspiring, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a book for this age and wisdom for generations to follow.” 
—Trillia Newbell, author, Enjoy; Fear and Faith; and United

“Image is everything, and for a woman who has built her identity on the sands of how she’s embraced online, the eventual letdown will come like a crash. But there’s a better way forward, a way to use our phones in selfless service, to glorify God in our connectivity, and to image Christ by our phone behaviors. For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”

For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”

“As a teenager and a smartphone user, I needed this book. Tony Reinke is compelling and convicting, yet continually meets us with grace. My generation needs this book, because we need to get technology right. If we don’t, the cost is great. 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You should be a must-read for every smartphone user, especially for us younger ones.”

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands.

A timely and thoughtful book.”
—Andrew Wilson, pastor, Kings Church Eastbourne, East Sussex; author, If God, Then What? and Unbreakable

Is your phone changing you? That’s a question we all must ask ourselves in our iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Samsung Galaxy S8 culture. It’s a question that must be addressed in the Church as we pursue the sanctification and gospel mission required of us. Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a gospel-saturated, biblical, and sociological look at the phenomenon of the mobile phone and how it is re-shaping everything from our communication habits and skills to how we view the world around us. Reinke’s book is a must-read for any Christian with a cell phone—especially those smartphone users who hear that constant voice saying, “surely I have a new notification, right?!” and then look at their phone only to be left with sad reality of a phantom vibration and an unmet need to be desired.

Same Roots, Different Fruit

Reinke wisely reminds us in the introduction that “conversations about our smartphones often do not raise new questions; they return us to perennial questions every generation has been forced to ask.” Our phones didn’t create a new set of heart issues which the bible was unable to address. Rather, our phones are another example of something potentially good that Satan craftily uses to draw out the vices found deep within the recesses of our hearts. For many who haven’t adopted smartphones and social media, it is easy to look at the effects of these devices and forget that the cravings for approval, gratification, distraction, fear of missing out, etc. are symptoms of greater heart issues caused by our fallenness as humans. However, we can rest assured that God’s all-sufficient Word can address the underlying causes of our smartphone problems.

Repentance and Reliance Are Necessary

Throughout 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You, Reinke is clear that our smartphone issues are worship issues. He poignantly reminds us, “If we worship idols, we become like the idols...Our idols dehumanize us; they petrify our souls, and dumb and dull and deaden all of our spiritual senses.” As Christians, if we analyze our smartphone habits and recognize idolatry, there are only two options for us: repentance and reliance. 1 John 1:9 reminds that “If we confess our sins, (God) is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” There is no app, no knuckling-up, no deactivating, no shunning, and no self-discipline that can fix the root of our smartphone sin problems. The only answer is to repent and rely upon the faithful and just God who has become our Advocate by dying on the cross and offering us the free grace for true sanctification. It is God who is able to keep us from stumbling and who conforms us to the image of His Son. No other method for change is eternally effective.

The Choice Is Yours

In his conclusion, Reinke is unwavering that he does not advocate for a phone-free utopia envisioned by so many who see the impacts of smartphones. In support of his personal use of a smartphone, Reinke states, “For now, in this season of ministry, I will own a smartphone. But like never before, I can see how unnecessary the phone is to most of my life.” That is the path I find wisest in this season of my life. I will be more intentional in examining my smartphone habits as I seek to gain a higher view of Christ and His glory. However, Reinke applauds those who are willing to give up their smartphones for the glory of God in our culture:

Giving up a smartphone is not only one of the bravest and most countercultural acts of defiance possible today—it is a gift to others. If I’m a social-media junkie, my lack of self-control feeds the social media addiction in you. And the more I text and tweet and Snapchat, the more I drag you and others into the digital vortex of reciprocating obligation... To any addict brave enough to go smartphone free, I applaud you. You will serve the people around you in unseen ways that will never be noticed or celebrated.

If God is calling you to this radical stance, please walk in both obedience and humility. I thank you for your willingness to lead the way for others to follow. There are always saints that God will use in particular ways for His glory, and your stance will impact those who use their phones and those who don’t. There is room for smartphone-using and smartphone-losing saints in God's future Kingdom.
A Sober-Minded Response

We must each be sober-minded as we ponder James 4:17, “So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.” To answer the question, “Is your phone changing you?” We must all answer ""yes!"". The difference is whether that “yes” means we are being changed for better or for worse. That is ultimately a question that must be answered through biblical, Christ-centered self-examination both in solitude and community. It is utterly crucial that we refuse to let a small piece of glowing metal numb us to the greatest glory experienced in the entire universe–God Himself. Eternity is far too valuable for that.

I consider this to be rude and have stated such to those in my family who do this.

Such devices are very handy to pass the time when out walking or running exercise or even in the gym when struggling through a tough workout. These devices have also enhanced my knowledge base by offering various forms of audio books.

I currently have an audiobook library of several hundred books, most of which would never have been read if I only had physical books. I spend hours on the road as part of my job and commute. Audio books also pass the time in an entertaining way when on long road trips.

Almost all of this reading (listening) is done when I am alone.

This is unfortunately not the case for many, many people, especially younger folk. It is becoming more and more common to see ear buds in both ears of young people even when in the presence of friends and family.

As Tony Reinke points out in his book, these behaviors have only gotten worse now that we have instant continuous access to not only audio but also pictures, video and political speech twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.

While there is a great deal of knowledge that is either necessary (google maps) or beneficial (election results), much of the information that is readily available through various online sources on our cell phones is either inaccurate, completely false or inconsequential to our lives.

It is very discouraging to see a group of friends or family members sitting together at a dinner table or out together, each one glued to his own cell phone. The breakdown of face-to-face communication which started with phones, migrated to email and now has blossomed with the various social media formats led by Facebook have in my opinion, moved us toward a less loving, less caring society driven by the opinions of others.

This book is a wake-up call to those of us who are unwittingly falling into this trap of information overload and the breakdown of our relationships.

The author makes a point of the effect of these devices on our spiritual life. I agree with some of them but as he admits, there can be an enhancement of our spiritual life through the expanse of Biblical truth and study also available on our pocketable device. I personally attend church with a netbook loaded with multiple versions of the Bible, commentaries and a newly downloaded set of sermon notes. This device has greatly enhanced my church experience.

The narrator, Tom Parks did an excellent job of narration and kept the book interesting all the way through.

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives.

“Rarely is a book as practically impactful as it is theologically rich. In an age in which daily we are drawn into a digital vortex, Tony Reinke warns of the implications and challenges us to examine whether our phones have displaced our spiritual priorities in Christ.

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions.

—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”
—Jackie Hill Perry, poet; writer; hip-hop artist

“In contrast to the television that dominates the modern living room, the smartphone is typically far less conspicuous in its presence. Perhaps on account of this subtle unobtrusiveness, surprisingly few have devoted sustained reflection to the effect this now ubiquitous technology is having on our lives. In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”

Jacques Ellul penned The Technological Bluff (1990). Now in 2017, Tony Reinke writes a fantastic book, filled with penetrating theological insight, rigorous research, and probing analysis on the nature of the smartphone and its users, and the only thing that falls flat is the less-than-alluring title, Twelve Ways Your Phone is Changing You.

In 2016, Time magazine declared the iPhone as the most influential gadget of all time. The world of smartphones is far different from the world of silent movies or Atari. To minister in such a world, the church needs an army of servants, teachers, and shepherds who can personally find freedom from lurking smartphone dangers. Only then can we assist others to handle these amazing gadgets to the glory of God.

But what if you struggle with smartphone abuse as I do? For instance, my smartphone overuse at home is the most common argument between my wife and me. My kids will sometimes stand in front of me and say, “Dad, I thought you weren’t working today,” while I sneak in a quick email. Quite unconsciously, in the middle of meetings (that in my pride I have determined as boring) I will pull out my phone to check my favorite teams’ sports scores.

To whom shall we go? Answer: Jesus, and Reinke’s book can help. This book cannot save you, but the God to whom this book points can.
Each chapter stirs our affections, challenging us to look away from our device and instead toward our satisfying Redeemer and Creator. In the end, Reinke’s counsel related to the smartphone turns out to be a tutorial on human engagement with all technologies.

With compelling sentences, Reinke forces theological inquiry in the face of technological temptation: “What if the rhythms of Snapchat selfies and our star-studded Instagram feeds are exposing the dimness of our future hope?” He offers a well-crafted turn of phrase, one after another, such as, “The clicks of our fingertips reveal the dark motives of our hearts, and every sin—every double-tap and every click—will be accounted for.”

Later in the book, Reinke argues, “It is better to lose the capacity to scroll for pornography than have your whole body thrown into hell.” Fitting words for someone like myself, greatly thankful that God freed me from a pornography addiction before the onset of smartphones. Sadly, this dark sin still shackles others with Tinder, chat rooms, and images squalling feverishly for lost souls in cyberspace. Others racked with crippling loneliness turn to their phones to deal with relational fears, believing the lie that through a few million microprocessors and network connections isolation will end.

So, read the book. Find freedom in Christ. And Crossway, after this book goes through its first printing, consider a retitling of the book (the existing title can serve as a subtitle), such as, Swiping Our Souls to Death, Seeking a Screen Savior, or iSwipe Therefore iAm.","Wonderful book, weak title",https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/product-reviews/1433552434/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Matthew Proctor,phone_#N/A_1433552434_Matthew Proctor_493_3022, , ,AM,

There is no doubt that technology has positive outcomes but it can also become a snare to those using the technology if boundaries are not set. The fact is, technology is ruling our lives in many ways.

When I first heard about this book, “12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You”, I thought this would be a spiritual rant condemning cell phones but I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of throwing the proverbial baby out with the water, Tony Rienke takes a refreshing look at the power of technology and particularly our cell phones over us. What I appreciated most about this book is that he balances the positives and negatives relating to cell phone usage with Scripture and a Biblical view of God’s purpose and plan for the use of technology.

He concentrates on the greater concern of how this technology is both subtly and openly controlling and changing us whether we are cognizant of the changes or not. He also considers the boundaries that must be established in order to use this and all technology in a way minimizes the negative aspects and supports the positive.

For this reason, I would strongly recommend this text and would encourage every pastor and ministry leader to purchase a copy. In fact, this book would serve as an excellent preaching outline as everyone, not just pastors, needs to hear this message!",A much needed text for our current society,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/product-reviews/1433552434/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Robert W.

About the Author
Tony Reinke is a journalist and senior writer for desiringGod.org. He is the author of Lit!: A Christian Guide to Reading Books; Newton on the Christian Life; and 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You.

John Piper (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and the chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for 33 years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than 50 books, including Desiring God, Don’t Waste Your Life, This Momentary Marriage, A Peculiar Glory, and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.",#,1433552434,4.7,12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/dp/1433552434/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&qid=1496404584&sr=8-56&keywords=phone,phone_#N/A_1433552434,#N/A,2017-05-10 00:00:00,5.0,"Technology changes things. It changes people. It changes us. Books can also have that effect. Tony Reinke's book serves up a wonderful 12 course meal for us that is educational, insightful, wise, and quite frank. Evangelical leaders, we need to read this book, together, and begin to formulate, together, a deeply wise approach to good and healthy use of ""online technology"" within the context of Christian life and fellowship.

Reinke describes how real-world landmarks of life like time, locale, friends, and interests are shifting or vanishing as the tsunami wave of online culture makes landfall, scouring our personal landscape clean. Our people are standing in a field watching cute cat videos on their smart-phones as the wave washes over them. Can we, together, grasp an anchor that will hold, enter an ark that will not sink, cling to a cross that will not fail, live for a Savior who will not forget; and in so doing help people learn to live transparently, intentionally giving themselves to one another in friendship and love instead of in selfies and likes?

Reinke offers several principles for diagnosing your use of technology; good and bad, healthy and dangerous. These principles will endure far beyond any specific software that is mentioned. Facebook will eventually go the way of the once absolutely necessary phrase - ""IBM Compatible PC"". The principles will remain relevant, useful, and applicable long after Facebook has killed the book and simply become Face (or more likely Me).

Reinke is no knee-jerk Luddite alarmist. He is an active user of technology and writes from that experienced viewpoint. He stays balanced throughout, raising challenges of technology sabbaticals and regular evaluation of your use of tech (including asking those around you), as well as the incredibly radical suggestion that you put the phone down during family meals to enable you to focus on and delight in your loved ones face to face.

One extended quote to give you a feel for the passion and insight contained:
""We cannot continually chase the lure of public praise and affirmation by self-replication. Such a desire will kill us spiritually, and Paul signaled why. In God's economy, approval is something we must wait for. Those who feed on little nibbles of immediate approval from man will eternally starve. But those who aim their entire lives toward the glory and approval of God will find, in Christ, eternal approval. The stakes are that high."" p.77

I recommend this book to any and all who are interested, and to all Evangelical leaders regardless of interest. The algorithms of online addiction are real. They are at work within your congregation. We must respond, together, dear brothers and sisters with a robust Christian worldview. Please, let's go for pie and coffee and talk it over.","Several reasons to read ""12 reasons""",https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/product-reviews/1433552434/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,David L.

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions. Tony Reinke’s reflections on the smartphone offer helpful advice as to how people today need to be vigilant regarding the impact of their favorite new technologies.”
—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”
—Jackie Hill Perry, poet; writer; hip-hop artist

“In contrast to the television that dominates the modern living room, the smartphone is typically far less conspicuous in its presence. Perhaps on account of this subtle unobtrusiveness, surprisingly few have devoted sustained reflection to the effect this now ubiquitous technology is having on our lives. In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”
—Alastair J. Roberts, theologian; blogger

“Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is one of the most important little books a twenty-first-century Christian could read. Highly recommended.”
—Bruce Riley Ashford, Provost and Associate Professor of Theology and Culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

“For many, the phone is an object of increasing anxiety, exhaustion, and dependency. The wise Tony Reinke leads us practically to find freedom from the phone without requiring us to huddle away in a monastery somewhere in the middle of Montana. If you want to know how to steward your technology and your life for Christ and his kingdom, read this.” 
—Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention

“If you feel uneasy about your constant relationship with your phone (and even if you don’t, but wonder if you should), you will find Tony Reinke to be a reliable guide for how we should assess the impact of our phones on ourselves and our relationships. A marvelous book that tackles a massive subject in clear and compelling language!”
—Trevin Wax, Managing Editor, The Gospel Project; author, Gospel-Centered Teaching, Counterfeit Gospels, and Holy Subversion

“Two things strike me about this book. First, Reinke writes with great humility, including himself in the narrative to help us see him not only as a teacher but also as a fellow struggler. Second, this is not a guilt-ridden slog through what not to do. Tony keeps pulling us up into the glories of Christ and even helps us to dream of new ways to glorify God through our digital technologies. Helpful, hopeful, humbling, and inspiring, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a book for this age and wisdom for generations to follow.” 
—Trillia Newbell, author, Enjoy; Fear and Faith; and United

“Image is everything, and for a woman who has built her identity on the sands of how she’s embraced online, the eventual letdown will come like a crash. But there’s a better way forward, a way to use our phones in selfless service, to glorify God in our connectivity, and to image Christ by our phone behaviors. For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”
—Gloria Furman, author, The Pastor's Wife; Missional Motherhood; and Alive in Him 

“As a teenager and a smartphone user, I needed this book. Tony Reinke is compelling and convicting, yet continually meets us with grace. My generation needs this book, because we need to get technology right. If we don’t, the cost is great. 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You should be a must-read for every smartphone user, especially for us younger ones.”
—Jaquelle Crowe, lead writer and Editor in Chief, TheRebelution.com; contributor, The Gospel Coalition; author, This Changes Everything

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands.

He served for 33 years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than 50 books, including Desiring God, Don’t Waste Your Life, This Momentary Marriage, A Peculiar Glory, and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.",#,1433552434,4.7,12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/dp/1433552434/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&qid=1496404584&sr=8-56&keywords=phone,phone_#N/A_1433552434,#N/A,2017-05-10 00:00:00,5.0,"“The smartphone is causing a social reversal: the desire to be alone in public and never alone in seclusion.” It is truthful statements like these that (should) cause concerning evaluation of technological uses in our lives. When the iPhone burst on to the scene, and now with the wave of smartphones, we had a new technology that not only transformed our lives, but was given the ability to infiltrate them in an unbridled manner. While the technological revolution is still new enough that we are unable to anticipate the full effects. However, we have enough information now to be thoughtful in our examination of technology’s impact upon varying areas of people’s lives. Tony Reinke’s look at such issues in 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is noteworthy.
If you do not know Tony Reinke, you need to. He is the author of one of the best books on reading, Lit!, a book that I freely recommend. Currently he servers as a senior writer for Desiring God. However, it’s his background as an investigative journalist combined with a deep Christian worldview that make him extremely capable in writing this book. Both Lit! and 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You confront technology’s transformation, not only of society, but also of individuals.
Few of us probably give serious thought to how our technological use, specifically the smartphone, creates issues in our lives. Sometimes those are manifested through our relationships, other times the issues are found in our emotional stability and turning from the things of God, or the impact is found in our physical failures. Because of the lack of examination, we often fail to connect our issues with our technological usage. Tony Reinke confronts readers on these very issues.
As an investigative journalist, he conducted his own survey with 8,000 people, interviewed a wide variety of people (including some well-known theologians). This is not a book then that was hastily put together. Instead the author has researched the topic, developed conclusions, and put them together for others. His conclusions will no doubt be confrontational. Assertions such as society’s addiction to distraction, desire to be comfortable in personal vices, and the increased fear of missing out are difficult realities that few want to admit to. Yet, his assertions are not only confirmed by his own research but by our own experience. This is not a mere report of information though. Instead, Reinke has put together the information in such a way that readers can evaluate both its truthfulness and reliability, but also evaluate one’s own life in light of this information.
What makes 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You such a worthwhile read is its theological interpretation, personal confrontation, societal implications, and individual applications. Tony Reinke does not merely present findings, facts, and figures, but instead he uses a solid theological basis from the Bible to interpret those findings and deduce applications. Thus as he writes about what is happening in our society through the increasing smartphone use, his information becomes very personal as it confronts the reader’s individual habits and ultimately soul.
12 chapters of the smartphone’s impact upon our society suggest that the author is anti-technology. However, each chapter closes with some quick thoughts on reigning in technology and the final conclusions of the book are meant to help readers to live smart with their smartphone. Such implications serve his goal to answer “What is the best use of my smartphone in the flourishing of my life?” Therefore, he is not suggesting that readers get rid of technology, but instead learn how to embrace technology with discernment.
Perhaps Tony Reinke’s next book should be one that lays out 12 advantages of technology with an overview of how to engage with technology while putting up barriers of protection in the process. For now though, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a necessary book for our current culture and I would encourage all to place this book on the ‘to read’ list . . . and while you’re at it, pick up a copy of Lit! as well. You will learn much from both books.

I really appreciate that it is from the perspective of someone relevant in today's culture who uses technology like the average person, and not someone saying ""I remember in my day, we didn't have phones like this"". It is also not a book encouraging you to get rid of your smart phone, but one that teaches you how to use this technology in a healthy way that also glorifies God. There are things I expected to be in the book, but also eye-opening ideas that I have never thought about before. I find myself thinking of these principles in multiple ways that have been truly helpful. I have told many people about this book and have also wanted to buy this book for loved ones.

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions. Tony Reinke’s reflections on the smartphone offer helpful advice as to how people today need to be vigilant regarding the impact of their favorite new technologies.”
—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”
—Jackie Hill Perry, poet; writer; hip-hop artist

“In contrast to the television that dominates the modern living room, the smartphone is typically far less conspicuous in its presence. Perhaps on account of this subtle unobtrusiveness, surprisingly few have devoted sustained reflection to the effect this now ubiquitous technology is having on our lives. In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”
—Alastair J. Roberts, theologian; blogger

“Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is one of the most important little books a twenty-first-century Christian could read. Highly recommended.”
—Bruce Riley Ashford, Provost and Associate Professor of Theology and Culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

“For many, the phone is an object of increasing anxiety, exhaustion, and dependency. The wise Tony Reinke leads us practically to find freedom from the phone without requiring us to huddle away in a monastery somewhere in the middle of Montana. If you want to know how to steward your technology and your life for Christ and his kingdom, read this.” 
—Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention

“If you feel uneasy about your constant relationship with your phone (and even if you don’t, but wonder if you should), you will find Tony Reinke to be a reliable guide for how we should assess the impact of our phones on ourselves and our relationships. A marvelous book that tackles a massive subject in clear and compelling language!”
—Trevin Wax, Managing Editor, The Gospel Project; author, Gospel-Centered Teaching, Counterfeit Gospels, and Holy Subversion

“Two things strike me about this book. First, Reinke writes with great humility, including himself in the narrative to help us see him not only as a teacher but also as a fellow struggler. Second, this is not a guilt-ridden slog through what not to do. Tony keeps pulling us up into the glories of Christ and even helps us to dream of new ways to glorify God through our digital technologies. Helpful, hopeful, humbling, and inspiring, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a book for this age and wisdom for generations to follow.” 
—Trillia Newbell, author, Enjoy; Fear and Faith; and United

“Image is everything, and for a woman who has built her identity on the sands of how she’s embraced online, the eventual letdown will come like a crash. But there’s a better way forward, a way to use our phones in selfless service, to glorify God in our connectivity, and to image Christ by our phone behaviors. For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”
—Gloria Furman, author, The Pastor's Wife; Missional Motherhood; and Alive in Him 

“As a teenager and a smartphone user, I needed this book. Tony Reinke is compelling and convicting, yet continually meets us with grace. My generation needs this book, because we need to get technology right. If we don’t, the cost is great. 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You should be a must-read for every smartphone user, especially for us younger ones.”
—Jaquelle Crowe, lead writer and Editor in Chief, TheRebelution.com; contributor, The Gospel Coalition; author, This Changes Everything

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands. Yes, our phones have changed us for the worse, but this book will change us and our phone use for the better.”
—David Murray, pastor, Grand Rapids Free Reformed Church; professor of Old Testament and practical theology, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary; author, Jesus on Every Page and Reset

“The more widespread and influential something is, the more Christians should think carefully about it. In this wisdom-filled book, Tony Reinke helps us do just that with the smartphone. Without descending into technophobia or paranoia, he shows the various ways in which phones are changing our lives, highlighting both the problems with this and the solutions to it. A timely and thoughtful book.”
—Andrew Wilson, pastor, Kings Church Eastbourne, East Sussex; author, If God, Then What? and Unbreakable

“Rarely is a book as practically impactful as it is theologically rich. In an age in which daily we are drawn into a digital vortex, Tony Reinke warns of the implications and challenges us to examine whether our phones have displaced our spiritual priorities in Christ. With unflinching honesty, Reinke shares his own technological struggles, and in so doing, moves us to a posture of reflection, prayer, and even repentance. Thoroughly engaging and immediately applicable, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a must-read for our time.”

So what started as just a ""resource"" ended up being an eye-opening, life-altering book for me personally. (And a DEFINITE recommendation for teens and parents alike.)

It is obvious that Reinke did vast amounts of research. Every page has footnotes, which I found to be icing on the cake. I really enjoyed reading some of the footnotes, as well a looking up the referenced or paraphrased verses. He blends scripture and secular articles seamlessly.

One thing I particularly loved about this book is the humility and transparency with which Reinke writes. He is the first to admit that he is a ""techno-junkie,"" which makes the book read very well since it is not a ""YOU SHOULD DO THIS"" type of book, but rather ""Here are some things to be aware of because this is what I have been faced with first hand."" Another thing that makes this book incredibly unique and vital for today's phone-saturated world is that Reinke writes this book with the most important perspective: through the lens of eternity.

How does our usage of our phones and other technology affect our eternal impact? How does our unchecked usage of social media weaken our relationship with Christ?

He is quick to provide scripture and explain the implications using social media/apps/technology without an eternal purpose. He provides several lists of questions to think about and ask yourself about phone use/social media posting. I admire the fact that Reinke is not a phone-hater, but desires to explain the consequences of unchecked phone use. He does highlight some positives for using the phone and what the valuable asset that it can be in ministry; however, that is not the point of this book.

As one reviewer mentioned that you could read just the conclusion and get the gist of the book, I highly disagree. Yes, Reinke does a great job of recapping his book, BUT you would absolutely miss out on all gospel applications, the root of our heart-problem, and the opportunity to let the reality of social media usage sink in. You cannot afford to SKIM this book, and you certainly cannot afford to SKIP the meat of the book that is chapters 1-12.

If you own any digital devices, or find yourself in a time-suck with technology of any kind, I strongly encourage you to read this book. We all know we spend to much time on social media, and Reinke points out that we KNOW we do, yet FAIL to do anything about it.

I really enjoyed this book. It has made me more aware of my habits online. It has made me think twice about posting on social media. I have now set boundaries over my phone in attempts to redeem my time. This is a must read for you and everyone you know.","A humble, transparent, life-altering 'Must Read'",https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/product-reviews/1433552434/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Renee Young,phone_#N/A_1433552434_Renee Young_488_2776, , ,AM,

Whether you love technology or not, this book provides you with a good look at the culture that we are living in right now. I work at a high-adventure, Christian camp in the mountains of NC and one of the things that we have seen here is the freedom that students and chaperones feel being away from technology for even a limited amount of time. It's so easy to get disconnected from your own culture while right in the middle of it. And we often need to step back and get a better perspective. We become like fish not knowing that the water is wet!

I appreciate the fact that the author admittedly enjoys and uses all kinds of technology (including always having a smartphone) and can speak honestly about his journey with it. It means more coming from a guy like that.

Tony has obviously put a lot of time and energy into this book, for which I am very thankful, but I have to say that best thing about this book is that it is thoroughly theological. He will draw us again and again to the fact that we were created to experience the glory of God in relationship to Him and to His people. And the bottom line regarding the utility of technology is whether or not we are using them to better fulfill God's purpose for ourselves and others. If not, then we need to seriously think through how we are living in this culture.

I like this so much that we hope to give away a copy to every youth pastor who brings his students to Snowbird Outfitters this year.

In this book, Tony Reinke plucks these devices from the penumbra of our critical awareness and subjects them to the searching light of Christian wisdom. The result is an often sobering assessment of the effect they are having on our lives, accompanied by much prudent and practical counsel for mastering them. This is a timely and thoughtful treatment of a profoundly important issue, a book that should be prescribed to every Christian smartphone owner for the sake of our spiritual health.”
—Alastair J. Roberts, theologian; blogger

“Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is one of the most important little books a twenty-first-century Christian could read. Highly recommended.”
—Bruce Riley Ashford, Provost and Associate Professor of Theology and Culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary

“For many, the phone is an object of increasing anxiety, exhaustion, and dependency. The wise Tony Reinke leads us practically to find freedom from the phone without requiring us to huddle away in a monastery somewhere in the middle of Montana. If you want to know how to steward your technology and your life for Christ and his kingdom, read this.” 
—Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention

“If you feel uneasy about your constant relationship with your phone (and even if you don’t, but wonder if you should), you will find Tony Reinke to be a reliable guide for how we should assess the impact of our phones on ourselves and our relationships. A marvelous book that tackles a massive subject in clear and compelling language!”
—Trevin Wax, Managing Editor, The Gospel Project; author, Gospel-Centered Teaching, Counterfeit Gospels, and Holy Subversion

“Two things strike me about this book. First, Reinke writes with great humility, including himself in the narrative to help us see him not only as a teacher but also as a fellow struggler. Second, this is not a guilt-ridden slog through what not to do. Tony keeps pulling us up into the glories of Christ and even helps us to dream of new ways to glorify God through our digital technologies. Helpful, hopeful, humbling, and inspiring, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a book for this age and wisdom for generations to follow.” 
—Trillia Newbell, author, Enjoy; Fear and Faith; and United

“Image is everything, and for a woman who has built her identity on the sands of how she’s embraced online, the eventual letdown will come like a crash. But there’s a better way forward, a way to use our phones in selfless service, to glorify God in our connectivity, and to image Christ by our phone behaviors. For this, we must evaluate our glowing screens and train our discernment to see the difference between the sight-driven habits of our age and the Scripture-lit pathway of faith. Every chapter of this book is like the right kind of push notification in our lives. Stop, read, process, and apply with care.”
—Gloria Furman, author, The Pastor's Wife; Missional Motherhood; and Alive in Him 

“As a teenager and a smartphone user, I needed this book. Tony Reinke is compelling and convicting, yet continually meets us with grace. My generation needs this book, because we need to get technology right. If we don’t, the cost is great. 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You should be a must-read for every smartphone user, especially for us younger ones.”
—Jaquelle Crowe, lead writer and Editor in Chief, TheRebelution.com; contributor, The Gospel Coalition; author, This Changes Everything

“It took more than a generation for the quaint ‘horseless carriage,’ with all its magic and horror, to become the ordinary, unexamined ‘car.’ But the device we once called a ‘smartphone’ has reached its status as ‘phone’—a common, everyday inevitability—with such breathtaking speed that it has left us little time for reflection on the true power it has in our lives. Tony offers us a distinctly Christian take on the little wonders in our pockets, seeing their goodness, beauty, and power, but also applying godly wisdom and well-researched cautions to help readers use their phones without being used by their phones.”
—John Dyer, author, From the Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of Technology

“Experience practical theology at its finest as Tony applies a thorough understanding of the Scriptures to a thorough understanding of our culture, resulting in a beautifully written and balanced guide to the dangers and opportunities in the palms of our hands. Yes, our phones have changed us for the worse, but this book will change us and our phone use for the better.”
—David Murray, pastor, Grand Rapids Free Reformed Church; professor of Old Testament and practical theology, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary; author, Jesus on Every Page and Reset

“The more widespread and influential something is, the more Christians should think carefully about it. In this wisdom-filled book, Tony Reinke helps us do just that with the smartphone. Without descending into technophobia or paranoia, he shows the various ways in which phones are changing our lives, highlighting both the problems with this and the solutions to it. A timely and thoughtful book.”
—Andrew Wilson, pastor, Kings Church Eastbourne, East Sussex; author, If God, Then What? and Unbreakable

“Rarely is a book as practically impactful as it is theologically rich. In an age in which daily we are drawn into a digital vortex, Tony Reinke warns of the implications and challenges us to examine whether our phones have displaced our spiritual priorities in Christ. With unflinching honesty, Reinke shares his own technological struggles, and in so doing, moves us to a posture of reflection, prayer, and even repentance. Thoroughly engaging and immediately applicable, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is a must-read for our time.”
—Kim Cash Tate, author, Cling: Choosing a Lifestyle of Intimacy with God

About the Author
Tony Reinke is a journalist and senior writer for desiringGod.org. He is the author of Lit!: A Christian Guide to Reading Books; Newton on the Christian Life; and 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You.

John Piper (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and the chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for 33 years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than 50 books, including Desiring God, Don’t Waste Your Life, This Momentary Marriage, A Peculiar Glory, and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.",#,1433552434,4.7,12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/dp/1433552434/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&qid=1496404584&sr=8-56&keywords=phone,phone_#N/A_1433552434,#N/A,2017-04-28 00:00:00,5.0,"There can be no argument that our society is inundated with technology. As I write this, I am wearing an exercise monitor that automatically syncs with my phone. I am typing this on a laptop while watching a smart television. All of my vehicles have Bluetooth technology where at the touch of a button on the steering wheel I can say “call (insert name)” and I am driving and talking hands-free to someone perhaps all the way across the country. Want to listen to music? Access your phone. Want to read an e-book? No problem. Download one in mere seconds. Want to watch a movie? There is an app for that as well.

Technology is all around us, waiting to be utilized. As with anything in life, technology can be used for good and for evil and for many things that perhaps exist in the muddy middle. In a world full of social media and emojis, how do we navigate the technological surge that most assuredly will not abate anytime soon?

I recently finished reading a new book by Tony Reinke called “12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You”. Normally, upon completion of a book, I write a review sharing my thoughts on the merits of the author’s arguments. Because I believe the subject matter Reinke addresses is of the utmost importance, I want to share my thoughts on Reinke’s excellent effort in a slightly different manner than a “normal” book review. The issues addressed by Reinke hit home in a manner no other book on the subject of the use of technology has to date. We have a teenager in our home so should I say more? The answer is unequivocally “YES”!

A little bit of background as to why this is such an issue of importance in my own home. We are a family that has embraced technology. My wife, daughter, and I have the latest in cellular phone technology. We each have a tablet and a laptop. As noted before, our three vehicles are full of technological accoutrements. We Pinterest, Facebook, Tweet, and all number of other social media functions. No big deal, right? Everyone does that stuff these days.

The issue we have faced of late is what I believe the premise of Reinke’s work is all about, namely identifying the proper balance of technology. Reinke saliently states, “Unhealthy digital addictions flourish because we fail to see the consequences.” It is after all so easy to spend untold hours scrolling through Pinterest or even in the name of fighting the holy battle for the Kingdom of YHVH, hashing it out day and night on Facebook forums. Sharing the message of biblical truth is good. Addiction to social media at the expense of building healthy personal relationships – not so much.

Perhaps the most important issue other than the blatant neglect of personal relationships my family has been addressing is that of what Reinke aptly notes as the secret vices of social media. I mentioned earlier we have a teenager. For parents who may be oblivious to what is readily available at the fingertips of your children via their smartphone, let me clearly state it is not all righteousness. In fact, it is far from it. Since Reinke addresses this issue so well, let me share his thoughts on these secret vices. He states that technology “makes us think we can indulge in anonymous vices, even conceptually, without any future consequences. Anonymity is where sin flourishes, and anonymity is the most pervasive lie of the digital age. The clicks of our fingertips reveal the dark motives of our hearts, and ever sin – every double-tap and every click – will be accounted for.”

Stop and ponder on that for a moment. If that does not hit you in your gut then I want you to read Reinke’s statement at least 5 more times and let it sink in, especially if you have children with access to smartphone technology or other similar technology. It is very easy for children (and yes that includes teenagers) to scroll through Pinterest and share questionable pictures. It is amazingly easy to “stumble” across YouTube videos that contain lewd and disturbing material. A little chuckle here, a little that’s no big deal there and the seed of secret vices can become a not so secret habit as sharing questionable and no so questionable material then lures in others to begin or continue their own secret vices.

What is a parent to do? I do not recommend the ostrich head in the sand approach. Reinke deplores such a response, noting that falls under the do nothing strategy Satan is hoping we all employ. I do not suggest complete withdrawal from all things technology either. We live in a technology laden world. It is important for our children to be technologically savvy. After all, the job market will demand competency in this regard.

Parents need to come alongside their children to help them understand that while technology is not inherently evil, turning the corner towards improper addictions and behaviors is often just a few clicks away. It is vital for parents to be vigilant in providing accountability to their children. The specifics of what that accountability looks like may vary, but at a minimum, set in stone a regular review of your child’s online and smartphone activity. If necessary, employ readily available blocking apps and monitors. Help your child understand the purpose of these restrictions.
We have employed an electronics contract in our home whereupon we all agreed to the following list:

1) I agree to use devices only during the specified times with permission
2) I agree to put way devices at designated times, such as end of day, mealtimes, during schoolwork, church activities, etc.
3) I will remove myself and tell a parent or an adult immediately if something does not feel comfortable online.
4) I will not give out personal information including full name, passwords, addresses, or phone numbers to unknown individuals online.
5) I will not download apps without permission.
6) I will not lie or be dishonest about what I am doing on my phone because deceit could damage my trusting relationships.
7) I will not text, email, or say anything through this device that I would not say in person.
8) I will not take inappropriate pictures or post/share inappropriate pictures of myself and/or others.

Again, such a contract might look different for your family and situation. With that said, I recommend instituting such a contract with everyone in the home signing it. Place it in a prominent place. To do nothing as a parent to rein in and direct in a godly manner proper habits when it comes to technology is a recipe for disaster. Providing godly parenting is a must.
If you are struggling either personally or as a family with technology, I highly recommend Reinke’s book. It was a true godsend for our family at a time when we were in the midst of dealing with our own improper addictions to technology and heading off at the pass some bad habits that were beginning to form with our child’s smartphone habits. This is a book that strikes the perfect balance between recognizing the proper place of technology and noting as well how things can quickly go awry. I trust the personal approach to this review was helpful in identifying specific ways to utilize the truths provided by Reinke in this timely book.

I received this book for free from Crossway Books and the opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255 : “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”",Outstanding and Timely Book,https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You/product-reviews/1433552434/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Michael C.

“Are Christians using technology to transform the world or is technology transforming Christians in unhealthy ways? Especially since the era of Franklin and Jefferson, when inventing things and technological ways of organizing things became a way of life, Christians have needed to be alert to such questions. Tony Reinke’s reflections on the smartphone offer helpful advice as to how people today need to be vigilant regarding the impact of their favorite new technologies.”
—George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus, University of Notre Dame; author, The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship

“12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is an incredibly convicting and profoundly insightful read. Smartphones have become a part of our lives, but Tony explores the devastation to the human mind and soul due to devotion to technology. He calls us to examine not merely the use of our smartphones but the motives that inspire it. This is a necessary book for our generation, to remind us that our phone habits will either amplify or get in the way of our most important longing of all: the soul-satisfying glory of our Savior.”

(The correct answer is her, of course!) We worry that the other person is missing out on real life by focusing so intently on virtual reality.

I read Tony Reinke’s 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You with that worry in the back of my mind. The book delivers on its title by demonstrating in successive chapters how smartphones influence our thoughts and behaviors. We

1. are addicted to distraction,
2. ignore our flesh and blood,
3. crave immediate approval,
4. lose our literacy,
5. feed on the produced,
6. become like what we “like,”
7. get lonely,
8. get comfortable in secret vices,
9. lose meaning,
10. fear missing out,
11. become harsh to one another,
12. and lose our place in time.

More than talking about what smartphone usage does to us, however, Reinke outlines a theologically rich, spiritually practical take on these matters. Indeed, the question the entire book seeks to answer is this: “What is the best use of my smartphone in the flourishing of my life?”

Technologies such as smartphones are marvelous tools, increasing our productivity and online connectivity. The question is, how can we make use of these tools without succumbing to their negative effects?

I asked a lot of questions and spent quite a bit of time on multiple websites and store links. I finally settled on this, the AT&amp;T EL52203 DECT 6.0. I've had it for 2 months now and I like it better than the cordless phone set I had to replace (it was old). With this new set, you can check your answering machine messages (and delete them etc.) from your other handset; you don't have to go to the machine itself to check messages. You can also check messages from a remote location by accessing your 'remote #' - a two digit number you program into your phone, then access when you are away from home. Just call home and when the machine picks up, dial in your 'remote #' and you can hear your messages. You can read what is says on the phone very clearly. The sound on the phone is great also: it is clear with no interference, no 'other people talking', no clicking, no buzzes, nothing.....nothing but the person on the other end. Sooooo glad I bought this set and highly recommend it to others.",Best Cordless Phone Under $50,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-EL52203-2-Handset-Cordless-Answering-System-with-Caller-ID-Call-Waiting/27251410,AbbeeNormal,phone_AT&T_27251410_AbbeeNormal_218_1146, , ,WM,

The keys are covered on this model rather than stamped on (previous model). Most buttons had worn off on the older model. Easy to set up, get messages at the phone &amp; remotely. Cons-the contrast on the display is not the best. The most annoying feature is the last number to call in will not show up on the caller ID list until another call comes in. This was not the case with the older model. When the call comes in, caller ID does display. When the call is ended the ID will not show up. At work it quite frustrating. Sometimes I need to call that particular person right back &amp; will have to look up their number or call the phone from another line. There may be something I've missed in the manual.

The ""quiet mode"" is awesome and easy to turn on or off. The only thing that wasn't great was that the messages that recorded on the answering machine were a little garbled (poor quality recordings).

The phones worked great for 2 or 3 weeks and then started showing ""no line"" on the little LCD screen when it should say ""handset 1"" or ""handset 2"". I tested the phone out by calling with my cell phone and it would not ring and just heard a busy signal. If I tried to make an outgoing call with the phone it would give me a dial tone but any number I called would give me a busy signal. Basically the phones would not make or receive calls and I would always get a busy signal.
I would have to unplug the phone base from the electrical outlet and then plug it back in and it would go back to working normally with ""handset 1"" showing in the LCD screen. But the phones just started to ""no line"" out on me more and more. I tested my phone line with an old phone....it's not the phone line. It's these phones.

It took a full 23 hours for this one item to be available for pickup (versus the 1.5 hours on an item i picked up at Office Depot).  In addition, the outside of the phone package looked VERY rough (i'm not sure if the package had been opened before but there was a rip along the side).  Since the item was all wrapped up in a Walmart plastic bag i didn't notice this issue until i was in my car.  

It is my suggestion that the Walmart.com folks put their BEST foot forward by providing more timely service AND not picking items off the shelf that look rough.

Thank you very much.","Good product, fair service.",https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-EL52203-2-Handset-Cordless-Answering-System-with-Caller-ID-Call-Waiting/27251410,befaithful,phone_AT&T_27251410_befaithful_127_667, , ,WM,

The problem is massive amounts of Bloatware between AT&amp;T and Samsung. That would be fine if Samsung would have made or updated it with the internal fully mounted sd card option. If you like to use more than a few apps on your Android device this is not the phone for you because of space limited by bloated OS and loaded apps. Also the signal strength on this phone is not bad but it's not great either and it lacks some functionality like the ability to create some commonly expected shortcuts.

i will keep this phone a year or so then i will trade up. i had the gophone windows nokia lumia and it had tons more storage on it, i had numerous apps. i only traded because fb messenger app is no longer available to windows phone. so i got this express 3 about 3 weeks ago and i have already had to unmount my sd card and remove all my pics and delete some music in order not to run out of space, no room on this phone for games or much media. i am very disappointed. do your research and if you are going with a gophone find one with more storage. also, my onedrive is very slow to upload, i went to a concert and had to wait almost 14 hours before all my photos and videos uploaded to one drive, then i had to share them, save them to my pc and delete as i was getting low storage warnings. this is def not the phone for anyone who likes taking videos/pics.",like apps/storage keep looking,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Samsung-Galaxy-Express-3-GoPhone/51352483,vjb30,phone_Samsung_51352483_vjb30_245_1209, , ,WM,

I bought it thinking, hey, this is a samsung...must be good right? Well, it was for the first couple weeks...then it became slow and unresponsive at times. The Phone itself isn't bad, the body design is light and small enough to fit in your pocket without feeling like you're carrying a brick, (I'd advise a case, as the phone feels like a feather might break it). But then comes the internal design...the fun part. The processor starts out good, but after a couple weeks...well it's like the phone's running on XP, it slows down. If you're using the phone for texting and calling, it'll work just fine, but if you're looking for something to play games on or video chat...keep walking this phone is NOT for you. The camera is sub par quality, the speakers are not very loud, even with a volume booster it's hard to hear most music/videos. The text's can be responsive at times,but if you let the screen sleep and have the text open, you'll need to reopen the screen to see if you have a new one...as it won't notify you. The music volume on their...is well, decent if you have good headphones, but that's really it. If you're looking for a phone that can run pokemon go, keep moving you'll load then never move. I've also had to do about 2-3 factory resets on the phone and mind you I've got a anti-virus,cleaners and defraggers on there. STILL runs slow. If you're looking for a decent cheap phone, go for the LG Phoenix 2, it has better specs and will probably last longer.

Pros-Cheap,stylish,smooth case
Cons-Slow after short usage,cheap processor,overheats,low volume

Really good.  As of now, I am listening to songs ported through the phone's headset jack to the Aux port on my car stereo.  The phone's advanced sound options do more harm than good, for me, so I am happiest with those features dis-abled.  The phone acts like a high end model but with less sensors.  No compass app will work but you'll never be lost...this phone has GPS and turn-by-turn direction apps, namely AT&amp;T Navigator and Google Maps.  The phone has enough memory for essential apps only, so plan on spending $20 for a fast micro SD memory card.  An example, the SanDisk 32 Meg extreme U3, currently selling for $18.  If card is not fast enough..... phone will reject it.
Battery is good and you can replace it yourself without the need for the cost of a tedious phone repair expense.  Phone operates on current Marshmallow operating system which is peppy and will run your favorite games and banking apps.  Keep in mind purchasing the $20 micro SD memory card with it.  I wish I had.  Good WiFi and calls sound good.  Visual voicemail app does not work so I use Google Voicemail app and it works.  Otherwise, press and hold the 1 key to access your voicemail....easy peasy.
Windows users... Cortana app works great on this phone and you can activate her by pressing and holding the Menu key.  Office apps such as Word available.  Some cool looking glass launcher themes are available for transparent, glass-like buttons.  If you still miss live tiles on Windows phone, you can add widgets to this phone so reallly...you can call in love with a non-Windows phone that Will sync with your PC.  Colors on this display are so beautiful they seem to glow.  My sensors are pleased as is my mind with this GALAXY EXPRESS 3 AT&amp;T GOPHONE.
THANK YOU!",Sound is good.  Screen awesome.,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Samsung-Galaxy-Express-3-GoPhone/51352483,BILLYCOLT,phone_Samsung_51352483_BILLYCOLT_332_1792, , ,WM,

( The battery cost almost as much as this phone-$2.00 less) After having new phone service installed I needed to be able to reprogram our phones, thus I purchased this one. It was available in the store, but costs about $1.00 more than advertised online. It wasn't very expensive so I was skeptical...
The phone has several features I enjoy: Call Blocker built in. A large Phone book for numbers. A speaker Phone that works very well and is clear. Holds a full charge for 3 days with regular 3-5 minute calls made. Has many settings, such as ring tone, ring volume, etc... It works well with charter phone service also. You get a very clear call and one person has even commented to me about the quietness on our phone line now. ( I am sure some credit goes to Charter Communications for that.)

Overall worth the small amount spent 10X over. I have dropped it twice at least, no issues at all.

I read a lot of reviews on the Walmart site and felt it was a good bet.  I love the red!  Makes it hard to lose and it looks spiffy too.  The sound is clear.  It has the caller ID and speaker phone I was looking for.  I was able to figure out how to program in my frequently called numbers without using the instructions.  The price couldn't be beat.  I bought two.  My only disappointment was that they were sold out of the base and remote sets in this brand.  These say that they are ""expandable"" so I'm hoping that  the base set becomes available so I can link them to  rooms without a phone jack.

I was hoping the quality and volume of the sound coming from the phone wouldn't make me regret this choice.  I'm using this in a VOIP situation, so I realize the call quality can be heavily dependent on the call connection itself - a hit or miss with my VOIP service lately.  I found the volume of the sound for the handset was a little weak.  Even when using the speaker phone of the handset itself and not the base, the volume was still a little soft.  I never tried using the phone when mounted in the base to test speaker quality when in the base.

I tried to use the redial feature where you can select beyond only the most recent call made.  This phone doesn't have that even though I have other similar phones that do.  

The display was a little weak and hard to read unless looking directly at the display and not in direct or bright light, or not too dark either.  You have to  hit it just right.  Again, I'm comparing this to similar products that I normally would be using.  For that reason, I'm being critical of the phone's features, but it will do for now as a substitute.

Overall this wasn't a bad solution for my temporary need, in spite of a few short comings.  The phone could be better and I'm glad it wasn't a lot worse.","Ok, but not the best solution",https://www.walmart.com/ip/VTech-CS6919-15-DECT-6.0-Expandable-Cordless-Phone-with-Caller-ID-and-Handset-Speakerphone-Red/45074431,Jifi,phone_VTech_45074431_Jifi_264_1345, , ,WM,

The reason i gave it a 4 star is because trying to figure out how to link a second phone is not listed in the manual that comes with the phone! It took a little bit of googling to figure it out. If you have a second phone you need to hold in the find phone button until the light blinks place the first head set on the main charger till it beeps and says handset 1 on the lcd Screen. Then you are going to repeat the process for each additional phone.,Great phone!,https://www.walmart.com/ip/VTech-CS6919-15-DECT-6.0-Expandable-Cordless-Phone-with-Caller-ID-and-Handset-Speakerphone-Red/45074431,Zan29,phone_VTech_45074431_Zan29_101_487, , ,WM,

I bought two at WalMart for my wife and me, our first smartphones, along with two 32GB micro-SD cards. We love the LG design with all the buttons on the back instead of the sides. It's a fully functioning Android Marshmallow, no compromises on the OS. Despite these being ""Go"" phones they can be put on an ATT or Consumer Cellular plan; we're on Consumer Cellular. It's now 6 months later and our phones just updated to Nougat (Android 7) automatically; there are some very expensive phones that won't be getting Nougat - this is just amazing. One of the few downsides of this phone was its not-so-great battery life with Marshmallow, but with Nougat I can see already that battery life will be very nice. 4G performance is good. It's not the fastest processor out there, but very usable. Caveats for picky people: screen quality can be different from phone to phone, so make sure you get a good one (look for evenness of the white ATT screen when it boots). The camera shoots great quality video and reasonable quality still photos (strangely the video quality beats the still quality); in low light though it's hard to get good photos or videos, but hey it's a $70 phone. I can't say enough about how much we enjoy these!

In just 3 hours the phone dropped from full charge to half and it was not in use. 
The keyboard layout is awful. I spend far more time backspacing than I do typing. 
Camera specs on the box gave me false hope. Pictures are grainy and difficult to make out, even in well lit areas. 
10 minutes into setting the phone up, I noticed a considerable amount of lag, which was the first red flag with this phone. 

I love the design and the ease of use, but that's about it. I'm sure this phone would be wonderful for someone who is just diving into the world of smartphones, but for an advanced user, there are far too many flaws.

The camera is probably one of the worst I've ever seen on a phone, but the display, hand feel and general operation are superb at this price point. 

NFC / Android Pay works well. However, there is no ability to cast or connect to wireless displays. This means, no screen mirroring with Roku.

The battery is very small and will discharge quickly, so keep a charger handy. 

1.5GB of RAM and Marshmallow 6.0 work well together, as does LG's ""double-tap"" to wake and rear-mounted volume and power buttons.

Like some folks, I've gone through severals smartphones over the years. Personally, I like having the option of switching between two phones (a casual phone for personal use and a smaller ""I don't mind if I lose or break it phone"" for work and play). Just swap out the sim card between the two phones as needed.

... When shopping for my backup phone, the size and specs sold me:  5-inch screen (1,280x720-pixel resolution),16GB internal storage, 1.5GB RAM and the MicroSD card support (up to 32GB) but the 2125mAh battery had me concerned. I mean it doesn't matter how good the overall specs are and phone performs, if your charge runs out, you're screwed. As with other LG phones I've owned in the past, I really enjoy the Double Tap ON/OFF feature.

 ... Just feel like a little larger battery would have been much more effective for the size and hardware. By the way, I know I have available options: purchase spare battery or plug it into to a cigarette light or outlet but it's a slight inconvenience at times. According to the phone's battery usage, the screen sucks up around 48% and I have it set on 30% with a shut off time of 2 minutes.

... Have only had the phone for a week but I did play music on the MP3 player while cutting grass with headphones on for 3 hours, with a couple of 10 minute phone calls and 2 text messages and the battery dropped 40%. Most days, I get online for roughly 10 minutes (youtube videos, 10 text messages and 40-60 minutes of phone calls). I'm not a gamer. Hopefully the phone will make it through the day with light use such as me.

... As far as the camera goes. With mid to low lighting (with or without flash on) you'll most like be disappointed. I'm not a big selfie taker but when I did with this phone, the quality was bad. Good lighting definitely makes a huge difference, much better. Just would have expected a little better quality with 8-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front-facing camera. 

... My other current phones are Alcatel Idol 3 and ZTE ZMAX 2. Both perform extremely well without having to back off on any battery sucking functions of the phone. The ZTE ZMAX 2 is an excellent budget phone. Even purchased it at Walmart. Don't know why they stopped carrying it? Just wish it was a little smaller size for my needs. Overall for a mid priced budget phone, the LG Phoenix is ok. Oh well, good luck!",Battery Life (?) and Camera (?),https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-LG-Phoenix-2-Prepaid-GoPhone/49660166,C2011,phone_LG_49660166_C2011_430_2365, , ,WM,
