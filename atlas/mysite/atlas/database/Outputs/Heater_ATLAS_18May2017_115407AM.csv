It has built in baseboard heating that I used over the 2015-2016 winter. With the baseboard system I heated my bathroom and bedroom only to keep costs down. My monthly electric bill was $120. This past 2016-2017 winter I just set this heater up in a corner and let it run, turning it off when I left. It took 2 or so hours for it to really heat up my entire apartment, but it kept me comfortable and was barely noticeable. Not too noisy. I didn't need to wear my jacket around the apartment anymore, which was nice. The best part, my monthly electric went down to $80 during the cold months I needed it.

The only con is that the tower scrapes along the base when it is oscillating, which can be annoying to listen to. Because I set it in a corner in the kitchen I didn't need to have it oscillating, so it was fine.",Heats a small apartment well,https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-5307-Oscillating-Ceramic-16-Inch/product-reviews/B005M03ER4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Sam Marsh, , ,AM,

 ,Stiebel Eltron,Heater,"Stiebel Eltron’s elegant surface-mount CK heater is perfect anywhere quick heat is needed. Designed and made in Germany, this quiet fan heater quickly warms an area or maintains a comfortable temperature. Perfect for both retrofit and new construction, the European downdraft design heats a space evenly. CK heaters easily replace older flush-mount heaters and are ideal for bathrooms, basements, offices, playrooms, 3-season porches, cabins, campers or RVs, and mobile homes. The built-in fan is extremely quiet in operation at only 49.7 dBA. A thermostat with an adjustable knob for setting temperature is located on the right side of the CK. In rooms larger than 215 sq. ft., the CK can be operated through a conventional wall-mounted room thermostat. The CK is designed with a frost-protection setting. The lowest thermostat setting will maintain above-freezing temperatures in an appropriately sized space. The external casing is made of stove-enameled sheet steel. The sides are made from plastic. The CK heater is designed to have its components recycled at the end of its useful life. Stiebel Eltron is a world-leading German manufacturer of technically sound products since 1924.
CK 15E is 120-Volt, outputs 1500-Watt, draws 12.5 Amp, and must be hardwired

 ,Stiebel Eltron,Heater,"Stiebel Eltron’s elegant surface-mount CK heater is perfect anywhere quick heat is needed. Designed and made in Germany, this quiet fan heater quickly warms an area or maintains a comfortable temperature. Perfect for both retrofit and new construction, the European downdraft design heats a space evenly. CK heaters easily replace older flush-mount heaters and are ideal for bathrooms, basements, offices, playrooms, 3-season porches, cabins, campers or RVs, and mobile homes. The built-in fan is extremely quiet in operation at only 49.7 dBA. A thermostat with an adjustable knob for setting temperature is located on the right side of the CK. In rooms larger than 215 sq. ft., the CK can be operated through a conventional wall-mounted room thermostat. The CK is designed with a frost-protection setting. The lowest thermostat setting will maintain above-freezing temperatures in an appropriately sized space. The external casing is made of stove-enameled sheet steel. The sides are made from plastic. The CK heater is designed to have its components recycled at the end of its useful life. Stiebel Eltron is a world-leading German manufacturer of technically sound products since 1924.

It's quiet and small and has adjustable settings in addition to the adjustable temperatures. I had a previous heater that I bought at a discount store that lasted me three years, but it always smelled like it was about to catch fire when I turned it on.

That's about par for all the small heaters I've had. I have no idea why they don't last more than a couple of years. I used it in a 8 x 8 bathroom and kept it dusted. Otherwise, when it worked, it heated pretty well for a small 1500 watt heater. It wasn't too noisy, but loud enough that you could hear it cut on in the next room. The handle provided is not very easy to carry it with. The red light stays on whenever it's plugged in. It tended to blow the GFI outlet fuse every time I turned it off.

When I found the The Lasko 1500-Watt Ceramic Compact Heater at Home Depot with just the right features of heat, fan, thermostat, nice energy ratings, I ordered 3. After we got them, several other folks saw & felt them in operation & really liked the size & setting options for heat & cooling so I ordered 3 more for some folks who sit near windows that get cold in winter & hot in summer. Well, I ended up ordering 3 more after that by request!!! We have over 200 employees & I noticed these little heaters give off enough heat for multiple cubicles. I've attached a photo collage of a couple in operation & one getting ready to be opened. Thanks for making the perfect little heater. I think it will be perfect for my daughter in TN to use in her garage when she's working on projects out there in the winter or summer.",this little heater/fan is a BIG HIT at our work desks :),http://www.homedepot.com/p/Lasko-9-2-in-1500-Watt-Electric-Portable-Ceramic-Compact-Heater-754200/100669067,bjslaskoheater, , ,HD,
