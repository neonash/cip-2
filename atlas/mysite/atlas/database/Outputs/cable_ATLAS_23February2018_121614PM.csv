Way better than running a long extension cord. One great thing about armored cable is that the rats cannot chew through it, like they can on an extension cord. It has three really nice wires inside and these have colored insulation. When you hook one end of the wire to a breaker, the electricity comes out the other end. You can hook up all kinds of things to this wire and they will work just fine. Just make sure you don't overload the wire, since it is not meant to carry too many amps. When you get a 250 foot roll. keep it wrapped up and pull out just what you need. If you unwrap it, the roll just springs apart and it gets knotted up, 250 feet of wire can really get tangled up.
