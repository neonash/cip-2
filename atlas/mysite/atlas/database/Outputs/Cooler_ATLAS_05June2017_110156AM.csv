I like the handles and split top, however; this cooler will not hold ice for 5 days. I filled the cooler with food, drinks that were from the refrigerator so they were chilled. I added ice around 3p on Friday and by Saturday morning there was no ice left. I did leave the cooler outside, in the shade where the high temp was 82-84 degrees all weekend, but I continuously had to add ice. The ice did not last over night at any point Friday through Monday.

I haven't actually used it yet, but I like the large capacity. We have another cooler, but it is smaller and doesn't have wheels. After you get ice and drinks and food inside it becomes quite heavy, that's why I wanted wheels. We go to the beach a couple times a year and I believe I can fasten a couple items to the extended handle. The lid is also very secure and having 4 cup holders mounted in the lid, keeps them from sliding off, plus like having a small table.
We also have family in New York, and this will either sit in the back seat or trunk. This will keep our bigger items cold for long time.","Big cooler, great value!",https://www.walmart.com/ip/Igloo-60-Quart-Ice-Cube-Roller-Cooler/23735487,JKMac,Cooler_Igloo_23735487_JKMac_145_756, , ,WM,

The lid is tempting to sit on, although it clearly says not to--if you do, it will probably crack and deform, as ours did, which is one of the reasons we replaced it with the new one. It's an unusual size that often fits in places where other coolers don't. We use it for drinks and it holds plenty of them. On the old cooler, the handle eventually wouldn't retract fully--another reason we replaced it. Because it's deep and tall, it holds many drinks, but sometimes you have to dig around to find the one you are looking for. Lid closes well and it seems to hold ice for quite a while.

I read the reviews and it did leak some. I changed the o ring and it stopped. It holds ice for several days, and I'm very pleased with my purchase and product for the money.

Last week I was hooking up to my 5th wheel RV and it slipped out of the hitch and all 1200 lbs landed on my cooler. Having this happen in the past the RV fell on my truck bed and caused several thousand dollars in damage. This time my ozark cooler saved my truck and as a result the cooler now has battle scares. I wish I would have taken pics when the trailer was resting on the cooler but my first instinct was to lift it off.  It was crushed in and I thought my cooler was ruined. The caved in lid popped out and still works as if new.  Now I have a reminder to help me make sure the RV is locked in and can't fall out when I use it again. I have not used any other coolers like the Yeti or rtic but would
Highly recommend the Ozark Trails as the best bang for the money.

Ice solidified into larger blocks after hours on the water.  I got home and out of curiosity just kept the lid closed to see how long the solid ice chunks would stay.

However, it did not last the whole weekend before a screw stripped on the latch.  I exchanged it for a new one in the store but this one had a different gasket design.  The original was one continuous gasket while this new design was not and had a gap.  It leaked when ice was sloshing around, but I was able to take the gasket partially out and reset it so that it did not have a gap anymore.  This fixed the leak but   

However, I noticed the inside of the lid was slightly warped.  I am returning this one as well.  I think they are on the right track but their quality control is a little iffy at times.  The latch also has me worried about longevity with the design they chose.  However, other brands have the same design and they seem to hold up fine so that might be unfounded.  Overall, if you spend the time to really inspect each cooler before you buy it this could be a good deal, but you shouldn't have to be quality control in my opinion.","On The Right Track, Not There Yet",https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-52-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229404,Will,Cooler_OZARK_49229404_Will_205_1006, , ,WM,

The cheap plastic ones have their allure and uses, but for a rotomold cooler, I don't think you can go wrong.  It seems to hold ice for a decent amount of time.  See youtube for varied accounts of this cooler's ice keeping capability.  I received mine with a cracked drain plug and I received a replacement two weeks later.  A standard garden hose sized plug works and so does a garden hose connected to divert drainage if that's your fancy.  I believe the Gander Mountain PermaChill Cooler is the same cooler yet it costs significantly more.  The parts for the PermaChill (Latches) will fit the Ozark Trail.  From what I read, the latches are the weak link.  I give this cooler 4 stars because I'm a pragmatic optimistic pessimist (Yea, it's an oxymoron).  I don't think one can go wrong with this cooler.  If you want Yeti performance at twice the money, go buy one.  If you're a weekend warrior and want a little better quality cooler than the myriad of plastic options, this cooler is for you.  It's made in China, but what isn't these days.  Several days of ice keeping from full are definitely possible with this beast.  I say beast because once it's full, it's a heavy load.

Air tight.
Cons- first time out held ice for only 5 days, States it will hold ice for 7 days. Average temp outside was 75 degrees. Some condensation arround the orange section of the plug. No leaks though.
I didn't have a yeti to compare it to but was a little disappointed with ice retention. Over all this is a well built cooler but still a bit over priced for the performance. The true test will be in this summer during the heat.

pros:
held Ice well
good fit and finish
Not yeti quality but 1/3 the cost and less likely to walk away
Heavy..could be pro or con depending on how you look at it! :-)

cons:
handles need to be longer..loaded it smashes your fingers against the top when one person is loading with the handles.

check to make sure your rubber feet are tight. They are bolted on and mine were loose. Had one come off in the back of my truck. Easy fix.

The reason for the disappointment is it won't hold ice. We have used it four or five times going to the lake and the state park. 

We kept it in the house and before we would use it put cold packs in it to get it cold, but the result was the same. Each time it would only hold ice for a little while. 

Also, one day on the boat I noticed the top layer of plastic on the lid was bubbling up.

Really hoped this would have worked out.

I don't typically use a cooler for more than a day of fishing but it does seem to hold the ice well.  My first use I put 20lbs of ice in it, the loose nugget kind, and after 3 days there was still some ice and this is in Florida and opening the lid multiple times. The build quality was not perfect, the right latch was not as centered as it could be and I did have some of the most frequent complaints about the drain plug leaking. Mine was extremely slight and I haven't really investigated that yet but it was really minor in my opinion.  Overall, I'm pleased with it.  The Perma Chill brand that Gander Mountain makes is almost identical to this, the only difference I could see is the color and it has 2 places to lock in the corners versus the Ozark had one in the middle and Gander Mountain's is more expensive by about $100 but the replacement latches, handles and plugs that they sell will work with the Ozark.  My opinion:  It's worth it if you need a good cooler for a good price right now (If you can find one).  If you can stand the almost 90 day wait, go with RTIC, they are only a few dollars more than Ozark, still way cheaper than Yeti, Bison, Engle, Pelican etc. and better built.",Probably as good as the more expensive brands,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-52-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229404,1fishkiller,Cooler_OZARK_49229404_1fishkiller_266_1340, , ,WM,

I followed the directions - i precooled the chest.  In addition to ice, i purchased the refreezable freezer blocks to really make it work.  I loaded the chest before i took off across texas and the ice was melted before i got to my destination.  Items were cold but ice melted just like a regular ice chest.

The 26 qt cooler will hold a 12 pack of 12 ounce cans, 6 -  (16 ounce) bottles of water, and a 10 pound bag of ice full to the top.
I put it in my suburban while in Florida(75 degrees at night/90 degrees during the day) last week and left it in the vehicle(black suburban).  I do not know exactly when the ice completely melted but after 48 hours, I checked the cooler and the ice was all melted, HOWEVER, the water was still very cold and the drinks were still cold enough for a cold drink.
So for a 10 lb bag of ice keeping drinks cold for 2 days in a hot vehicle is pretty good.
It definitely performed better than the ""5 day"" Coleman 50 qt cooler for $30.  My Coleman would NOT keep the same amount of ice in the same conditions for 8 hours at the beach!
I will do a beach test next week.
Whether it is worth the price of $96 will be up to you.  I think it is a good investment.

As advertised as far as I'm concerned.  The down side was when I went to drain it, I discovered that there was no plug.  My bad for not noticing, but this is a bigger deal on these coolers.  The reason is that they are very heavy (necessarily) to start with.  Add in about 20 lbs of water, and they are more than my wife can manage on her own.  So, just to drain the cooler required removing the contents, just to get the water out.  But wait, there is more!  The gasket system is impressive, in that when I went to open it to drain the water, the lid was essentially glued closed.  I kept checking to see if I had forgotten one of the very tough latch straps, but it wouldn't budge.  I eventually had to lever it open with a screwdriver.  To be fair, the next bag of ice didn't present the same problem, so perhaps it was just something ""new"" about it.  It's going back.  We love our Rtic cooler that hits these high points with a drain plug... and double the price.  Expensive drain, yes, but it really makes a difference.  I'll look for a redesign with a plug.
This review is, btw, for the smallest version.  I can't imagine how anyone would want to deal with the weight of the larger models (whether this brand, or Rtic or Yeti).  Sure, some brawny kid can show off by dead lifting one, but they are a two person job above these smallest coolers.",Going back.. missing a drain plug,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-26-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229405,bookernoe,Cooler_Ozark Trail_49229405_bookernoe_293_1471, , ,WM,

Pro's- Perfect mid range size. You can fit a case of drinks in it with ice and it will stay cold for days. It's very solidly made and can double as a spot to sit. Love the bottle opener built into it and the ruler on the lid. 

Con's- Doesn't have a drain plug. For $100, feels like they could've added one like the Yeti or RTIC. Not a big deal as u can easily pour out the water. The lid doesn't sit flat unless you latch the cooler and the latches do take some effort to close and open. On a positive note, that would keep a small child out of your beverages. 

Overall, it's a well made cooler that you will likely enjoy if you are in the market for a reasonably priced, hardcore cooler.",Great size,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-26-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229405,Colt,Cooler_Ozark Trail_49229405_Colt_154_782, , ,WM,

So I have been searching for a good deal on a rotomolded cooler for quite awhile now. Once I found this one I knew my search was over. Although I have not conducted an ice test, it has made it through a 3 day weekend which is all I will ever need it to do. The latches are a little tight for my wife but no biggie. I do feel like quality control may be lacking which is understandable for the value of this cooler. After inspecting the few in stock I noticed some had more noticeable seems where it was molded together. Don't know if it affects performance or not but I did find one that seemed to be put together a little bit better. Once again this is probably just cosmetic",Best deal out there!,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-26-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229405,RobM,Cooler_Ozark Trail_49229405_RobM_148_766, , ,WM,

I kept the 73 Qt, but had to return this because it was so defective that it should never have reached a consumer in the first place. I am so disappointed in it.
The top and bottom pieces did not align properly, so that not only was it near impossible to latch closed, but it also left a more than 1/4"" gap between the two pieces, which I'm sure would cause the ice to melt quicker.
I now own an Orca (75qt) and a Yeti (35 qt) and friend's RTICs (45 and 20 qt) as well that I am comparing these too. These will stay firmly closed when unlatched and are easier to latch with the knuckle T latch. If my OT 26 Qt had not been defective, the latch style of these (and several other rotomolds on the market) is more challenging to align and is honestly the biggest dealbreaker. 
The next problem with the 26 qt is the annoying handle. It locks too firmly into place in three different positions which meant that I had to fight with it each time I wanted to change the handle position. Required both hands to mess with and the weight of this cooler itself is not enough.
This size did not have non-slip feet. The feet for it were actually super slick. Once loaded may not be a big deal.
I did not get to test the performance of the cooler compared to the others because of the issues, but the 73qt performed as well as my Orca in ice retention while camping in high humid 90's in the South this past weekend in direct sunlight outside. I did not notice any drain condensation issues on it. We did not test any of them for their full length the manufacturers' claims, but I don't think any of them would make it. (I also prepared them by keeping them inside for days prior to trip and pre-chilled them with 3 frozen ice jugs inside each the night before filling) They both had ice melting immediately because of the conditions, but still retained some after 4 days.
Other inferiorities of these compared to Orca, Yeti, and RTIC is the way the lids attach to the base. My Ozark Trails 73 qt has exposed nuts that can fall off and be lost whereas the others are more durable and concealed. A friend's kid came to me holding the nut in his hands telling me my cooler was falling apart the first time we used it. The quality of the rotomold is not as good. There are holes in the OT ones. I'm also not sure about the thickness or the insulating material. You are also going to have to pay sales tax to buy the OT, so you need to consider that when you factor in the value. The OT brand by far has the poorest QC, you may get a great one or a total dud. Any one of the many pieces that create the final product may vary from the next. You don't know what you are going to get when you order it online. I ordered an RTIC 45, but it is backordered. In the end, RTIC is the brand I would recommend by far for the best price and the good latches, hinges and other materials. (However, they aren't made in USA like Orca or Yeti, they will take your money for months before they send you the product, and their customer service etc is overwhelmed and unhelpful.)",Poor Quality Control,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-26-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229405,LizF,Cooler_Ozark Trail_49229405_LizF_590_3074, , ,WM,

No running water to be specific.

I couldn't be more pleased with its performance. Instead of traditional bags of ice, I just froze a bunch of drinking water in plastic bottles. As it melted, I used it as drinking water. Half of them still had ice in them long after I got home.

The drain plug is in a great spot for good drainage. The wheels make it very easy to tote around even on gravel, sand, and loose soil. The telescoping handle is great, but a little on the flimsy side. I wouldn't man-handle it too much. Use a little caution and it should be fine.

The cooler itself offers a lot of room and is of good construction. The lid closes securely and doubles as a seat with cup holders.

For the price, you really can't find a better cooler. If you pack it properly and treat it with a small amount of care, it will keep items cold for up to 4 days and should hold up to many uses.

It won't beat those really expensive coolers, but it will be in the same ballpark for ice retention. It's isn't built as well as them (gasket lid, stainless hardware, etc) but having a regular hinge is much better than

My previous wheeled cooler had the wheels going the other way, (both on the narrow side) so you had to lift it by the handle to pull it along. This one simply tilts, so you don't need to be partially lifting the cooler to drag it along. Also, my old cooler barely made it through a day. Using the same cooler tactics that I did before (ice it down ahead of time, only put cold food/beverages in it, keep it full, minimize number of times you open it, make sure lid is closed, don't drain melted water) I can keep ice for a few days now.

The telescoping handle is a joke.  It comes up, but will not lock into place, so if you are pulling or pushing the cooler down a ramp or a hill, the handle closes down and you are stuck with the cooler on the ground having to start all over again.

Used a heat gun to soften the inner liner and pressed the speakers in to place, while still being able to use this as a cooler.
This cooler is very well made and has the large 8"" wheels.  These are perfect coolers to modify.  Battery lasts for over 16 hrs and is bluetooth enabled, all wireless.  Perfect for the beach or camping.  I can still get a couple of days of ice usage with the mods.
