It's fully automatic (fills and drains itself, washes and spins in the same tub) unlike some of the other brands. It uses only cold water so that might be an issue with white clothes if you must have them looking their brightest, but all my clothes are dark, and I always did set my full-sized washer to just use cold water always to help minimize fading. I used to get away with doing 1 load/ wk with the full-sized but this is smaller so I do loads 2-3x/ wk now which I discovered I actually prefer since putting away the laundry is less tedious now because there's less of it (putting away laundry had always been my least favorite chore). You can connect it to a regular w/d hookup or a sink (it comes with optional wheels and a funky hose). I just bought a regular hose and hooked it up to the w/d connection. Even though the water inlet is plastic, make sure to put the hose on extra tight or it will make a mess as soon as you turn on the water. Hand-tight is not enough. Use a wrench and do it at least 1/4 turn past hand-tight. It Pairs well with the Panda dryer which they are small enough to fit together in a 3 sqft w/d room meant for a combo w/d (which I opted not to get since they are known to have issues).",Great washer.

I live in an apartment complex that only has one washer and dryer for about 20 units, and it doesn't work 75% of the time, so I started looking into portable washers. I bought the Panda washer from the Amazon Warehouse, but it arrived totally messed up so I ended up returning it. I finally found a Haier HLP21N on Craigslist and bought it, and have been so impressed with it.

I did 7 or 8 loads of laundry on the first day that I got it and it carried on like a champ - no issues. Definitely read the manual before using though - it will save you some headache. I was worried that mine wasn't working because the water wasn't coming through, but that's actually how it's supposed to work - the water only comes through when it needs to and it closes off the valve once it has enough. After I found a manual and read through and realized how it worked, I was good to go. It can't take a full load of laundry that you would put in a full sized washer, but it is still pretty good for a little thing.

I love that you don't really have to worry about it after turning it on; it does the wash, rinse, and spin all on its own unlike the two side washers that you have to manually move. The spinner works really well too - my clothes are barely damp when I pull them out, and I just put them on a drying rack and they dry within a day with no stiffness.

It is a little louder than I expected but I think it's just my paranoia of bothering my neighbors. I live in a studio apartment so I can hear it if I'm in a different part of the main room, but if I go into my bathroom or closet it's barely noticeable.

Living in an apartment I forgot how convenient it is to be able to do clothes in your own home, but now that I'm able to I'm not sure how I'll go back. I would highly recommend this little machine to anyone living in an apartment who is tired of having to go down to the basement or to the laundromat to do laundry. Before laundry was a chore that I would wait so long to do it ended up being a disaster, but now I can just do a small load every other day and I actually almost enjoy doing laundry because I know it's not going to be a huge chore.",Amazing machine for apartment living,https://www.amazon.com/Haier-HLP21N-Pulsator-1-Cubic-Foot-Portable/product-reviews/B002UYSHMM/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Jka,washer__B002UYSHMM_Jka_447_2231, , ,AM,

Love the convenience of not having to go to the laundromat anymore and clothes/linens come out very clean.

Up to now, I've stopped the cycle and separated the clothes. Also, the screw holes for the metal plate that needs to be attached to the bottom of the machine to minimize noise don't quite line up.

It's a little odd at first, but after a while it becomes like living in another dimension where people evolved the process of doing laundry differently. My clothes smell a hell of a lot more fresh all the time, and that's pretty dang great. It's a powerful little piece of machinery.

The washing process takes four times as much work as putting your clothes in a regular washing machine, and you can do probably a quarter of the load size of a regular washing machine. You MUST have a drying rack. The spin cycle does not fully dry your clothes, it just de-soaks them. You will have to devise a water supply/drainage system suited for your particular needs. I know people like the bathtub method. Mine is supplied by the sink in a half-bath (using a 15/16"" to 3/4"" faucet adapter), and it drains into the toilet. The hoses are hung neatly on small utility hooks when not in use. Keep a towel nearby, you may get wet.

For what it is, it is an amazing machine. I would scrap the instructions and follow some of the instructions listed in product reviews. It basically comes out of the box, ready to use... essentially zero assembly unless you are going to bother with running hoses, otherwise just add water at obvious times (wash and rinse).

For me this will be a machine that I keep on a sailboat to wash items like bathing suits, t-shirts and workout clothes. My first load had a variety of items to see how they would end up drying in the end: cotton golf shorts, one poly/cotton golf shirt, boxer shorts and one T-shirt. It could have easily handled more, but I was just experimenting. I only added a tablespoon of soap and filled the water about halfway. I did do two separate spin modes as I read elsewhere that it doesn't dry as well if overloaded on spin. It only takes 3-4 minutes to spin a few items of clothing about 75-85% dry.. 95% dry in the case of the poly/cotton golf shirt.

I can see using this machine not only on a boat, but also camping or in a dorm room...

The one time that I was able to use it, it washed and rinsed great. The spin cycle is easy to use , clothes come out almost dry. I have always kept a retractable clothes line in my bedroom since I don't like to dry any of my clothes. One big problem is that the drain hose is flimsy and it leaks from the inside of the machine a lot. There should be some where that a replacement hose can be bought that isn't as flimsy (cheaply made) but I haven't found it yet. I've only been able to use it once because of the leak. I wouldn't recommend it till the hose problem is resolved. They need to make a better hose for it. I forgot to mention that I ordered a Giantex portable mini compact Twin Tub and received instead Costway Twin tub.

I purchased this for an RV. Did a test load in the house. We did a load on the road and loved it. Then the second time we did a load on the road, the washer wouldn't drain. Well, that was a pretty significant problem, as we still needed to rinse the clothes. So we had to tip it up and get it to drain and do this a couple of times, scratching our shower in the meantime. I put the clothes in the spin dryer and it drained, so I don't know what the problem was. They ask to be contacted to make problems right, but I can't risk this kind of failure again under the circumstances that we need to use this.

About 5 minutes after removing it from the box I was washing my first load.. The reviews were right about the SHORT power cord and drain hose also that the hose that comes with the washer is just about useless (I am going to buy a turkey baster like the other review suggests). I did buy a hose that was in the ""also bought with this section"", put it on my bathroom sink, washer in the tub so it can drain and I started washing, drained, rinsed, drained, put 1/2 the load in the spin dry.. AND COULDN'T BELIEVE how fast the sopping wet laundry was 95%DRY when I took it out! I put the clothes on the pull up laundry rack on the porch and by the time I got done with the next load the clothes had dried!! I am so excited about this! The ONE ISSUE IS THAT IT SMELLS LIKE OIL, MOTOR OIL. Anyone else notice this smell, or is it just my machine?",Best $100 I have spent online!,https://www.amazon.com/Giantex-Portable-Compact-Washing-Machine/product-reviews/B01ALBMIEI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Amazon Customer,washer_Giantex_B01ALBMIEI_Amazon Customer_174_877, , ,AM,

I really cannot tell you how impressed I am, but I am sure going to try.

I've had the Wonderwash for about a week now and I've done laundry every other day. It's so quick and easy that I start it while waiting for my coffee to brew, let it drain while I make breakfast, do a rinse run while my eggs finish cooking, plate up my food while it drains, rinse one more time, and eat my meal while it drains the final time. It doesn't even need that final rinse, I'm just picky.

It is absolutely perfect for my scrubs. I can wash and hang a couple of uniforms every couple of days and never run out again. No more waiting for the laundry room in my apartment to have a free machine.

I've converted a closet into a make shift drying area with dollarstore plastic drop cloth, clothesline, and clothespins.

This machine has successfully washed scrubs, delicate, jeans, workout clothes, towels, sheets, and tonight I ran my tennis shoes through it! The absolute success of it, across the board, has me writing this review while it drains.

The machine is almost entirely plastic so it is super light weight. It snaps together easily for use. It uses very little water and detergent. Best of all, it really cleans.

When not in use, I wipe the drum dry and stash it in the same closet I use to hang clothes. This is a must have for travel nurses. No more hunting for open laundromats at 2am, or checking the facilities machines every hour hoping to get some laundry done.

I see this being great for camping too. I can't wait to take it on a trip. For now, it certainly sees enough use. Love love love this.

TIPS AND TRICKS (Because I can find a dozen reviews and very little advice)

°Add water and soap before clothes.
Keep a hand towel nearby for inevitable dribbles.

°If using hot water, pressure builds up (that's a feature, not a bug!) and sometimes the lid will start to leak. After a few turns, release the lid, lock it back down, and keep going. You may have to do this a couple times based upon how hot the water is.

°This is where that hand towel comes in. Give the drum a quick wipe to reduce splatter.

°Use a permanent marker to indicate the grooves on the drainage tube (see picture). This saves you the messy fumble of trying to line it up while water leaks everywhere.

°Use less water to rinse than you did to wash. The clothes are already wet, and too much water causes the unit to wobble and thud loudly when it is turned. I have found that my rinse cycles take about half the water of my wash cycle.

°Wash with hot and rinse with cold to save the ""lid dribbles"" when you don't need them!
I rinse twice. After my wash, I add a spoonful of fabric softener to the first rinse, and plain water to my second. My clothes smell fantastic.

°If you are line or coat-hanger-drying indoors, set up a fan to decrease your drying time exponentially. Also, it makes the whole room smell like clean laundry which is awesome!

°Worried you're not rinsing out all the soap? With dry hands, rub your washed clothes between your fingers and then rub your fingers together. If they feel slippery rather than just wet, rinse again. And stop using so much soap, jeez.

Hope that helps.",Impressive across the board,https://www.amazon.com/Laundry-Alternative-Wonderwash-Non-electric-Portable/product-reviews/B002C8HR9A/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Kiris,washer_#N/A_B002C8HR9A_Kiris_575_3211, , ,AM,

What it is and what it's not, IMHO. I did several loads of wash today and was really surprised at how much this little washer actually holds. I travel in an RV and usually only wash a few items at a time and often like to boon dock so this seemed like something I should check out and I'm glad I did. But before I get to high on praise let me clear a up few things. If you are really expecting to wash a load of clothes clean in 3 minutes buy sloshing them around in a bucket, all I can say is dream on dreamer, because you're going to be disappointed.

Example...I threw in a couple of jeans shorts, 2 tops 3 or 4 pair of socks and some underwear and they all fit in there very loose and nicely. Let me say that the dirtiest item there was a pair of shorts that my dog jumped up on with his muddy paws. After three minutes of washing that mud didn't even budge. However, after washing for three minutes soaking them for 10m and then washing them again for 5, my things came out really nice and clean! I was very pleased. But I have to tell you, the last time I had an infant to care for, as I recall, that little bugger was squirting awful messes out both ends, before I could possibly clean it all up. That said, how anyone can wash baby clothes in this washer for 3 mins and say they actually come out clean! Is a conundrum to me!

What I found worked for me. Mind you I have a double sink with a spicket that can be moved completely from right to left. So what I did was put the washer on the left side of the sink and allowed it to drain out and into the right. This also allowed me to put a one gallon, plastic, vinegar bottle in the right too! I would put the clothes in the tub, adding about a 1/4 c of powdered laundry soap. Fill up the bottle and turn it completely upside down into the top of the washer, letting it sit there on it's own to drain into the wash Then I would add another gallon. This brought the water right up to the middle of the washer. I did this to allow the clothes to thoroughly agitate. As others have mentioned, you cannot rotate this thing to fast but a nice even passe works nicely. And why some people are saying this is taxing on your arm is beyond me. I found it to be very easy and smooth, choosing to turn it five or six times in one direction and then reverse it. But mind you I wasn't bending over a bath tube either. My washer was sitting at a very comfortable waist high, height!

Using the 2 min wash, 10 min soak, 3 to 5 min wash method, I would then empty it and with the draining tube still on run a whole gal of water through it before removing the draining tube and filling it again with, this time, with 2 gals of water and rinsing for at least 3 mins. Longer for heavier items like a pair of jeans, bath towels etc. Then I would just drain it again and take off the top and pull the clothes out into the right side sink squish them down a few times let them set a min or so. Then ring them out and hang them up. No real stress involved but the whole process did take roughly 30 mins per wash load. However, I came out with some really nicely cleaned and rinsed clothes! Guess it mostly depends on what your expectations are and how much effort you are willing to put in. I didn't find any of this to be a tough job.

At this point I should also mention the elephant in the room. Does it leak?! Well the first two loads went off without any leakage. After that I noticed a very slight drip where the draining tube fits into the washer, which wasn't a problem for me it was sitting on top of (side note NOT DOWN IN) the sink. So that wasn't a deal breaker for me. I did also notice that if I took the time and worked with the drain tube to fit it perfectly the drip would stop. But who cared? It was dripping in the sink.

All in all I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this, especially to campers, RV'ers or off grid homesteads.Heck I'm having dreams of a wash fest, where I get a bunch of campers over, pull out the wine and beer and take turns cranking! Yeah! That's the ticket! Heck sounds like a good time to me, rofl. Not sure how much laundry will actually get done, but hey!

Hope this review has helped in some small way. I say go for it! It will pay for itself in no time, even for just a small load now and then. And it has a very small footprint. About the size of a 5 gallon bucket. So it is easy to store.","WonderWash, an honest review.

Placed outside or in the tub is best. Cause it Does leak a little due to pressure inside.

Slow turns, make it plop. If it's not plopping, it's not gonna clean .

It works great. I like not having to worry about gas or oil. I feel that the pressure is good enough for what I need it for. It is strong enough to gouge wood - but that is due to me not paying attention to what I was doing. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five star rating is that you cannot lock the trigger on. I have to keep switching hands and in that process it is easy to let go of the trigger. I find that leaving the trigger off for several seconds before squeezing it again gets enough pressure to get it to run again, but I am afraid that might end up burning out the motor over time. I realize this is probably a safety feature, but if my leaf blower can have a lock on trigger why can't this? The machine is very easy to move around and the length of power cord and hose make it convenient to get around. I bought a metal connector separately because it was recommended by several users.

I bought it to clean my dog kennel and let's just say I swapped back to the $2 handheld spray nozzle I bought at Dollar General after 5 minutes. 1st, it has no pressure. 2nd the soap cup won't turn off - sprayed soap on ""soap"" or on ""rinse"". Unfortunately, I burned the box before trying it so I will have to purchase a box to return it. On a positive note, the seller was awesome and product arrived as stated with all the attachments.

To clean them I've been going to a local shop that uses an ultrasonic cleaning machine. The machine removed most of the static and cleaned up some but not all of debris-related skips. But at $2.50 a pop and a drive across town I thought I'd give a home remedy a try. After pondering between the Vinyl Styl and the Spin Clean, I decided to go with Vinyl Styl because of the way everything stores together. I cleaned 20 LPs from the 70's & 80's and when I dropped the needle on the first record I was stunned at how silent it is - no static whatsoever, it sounds brand new! The kit cleverly stores everything together in one storage case which is really convenient and well thought out. The spindle keeps fluid off the label, however I did dry off the gasket between records. That's another thing - keep a microfiber towel handy to manually wipe down each record before you remove the spindle as there is a lot of fluid residue left on the record. I used a microfiber cloth that came with another record cleaning solution. I also used a back-and-forth spinning motion to clean the records making sure to clean them both clockwise and counter-clockwise. The brushes inside the unit have a tendency to creep up out of their slots but I just pushed them back down - more of an inconvenience than anything else, they don't damage the record. And you can see the cleaning fluid doing it's job, it changes color and debris collects in the tray. Recycling the fluid is difficult, it's hard to transfer from the washer back into the bottle so plan to buy extra fluid to supplement what you lose (it's now available at Amazon).",Whoa - this works far better than I imagined!,https://www.amazon.com/Vinyl-Styl-Groove-Record-Washer/product-reviews/B01M0LRLM5/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Dean K.,washer_#N/A_B01M0LRLM5_Dean K._312_1706, , ,AM,

Even when used as instructed, the center labels still got wet on the edges, resulting in some bubbling,discoloration and wrinkling. When you leave the records in the stand to dry them, they dry just fine but leave a lot of streaking on the deadwax which looks terrible and I don't necessarily want my needle scraping through that.

I usually clean my records by hand which is sometimes a very slow process. I decided to try something to speed up the process. Wasn't worth my time. I had to go back over the 30ish records by hand to clean them again.

I did enjoy the overall build of it. How the drying rack was stored in the bottom of tub and the provided filters and funnel so you could reuse your cleaning solution was a nice touch.

o Pour 16 oz of cleaning fluid into the white tub.
o Screw-down the record clamp onto the LP. This protects the label and provides an axle.
o Place the LP into the tub between the submerged brushes.
o Spin the record by hand about 5 revolutions. The submerged brushes clean the grooves.
o Remove the record, remove the record clamp and place the clean record in the 15-record rack to dry.
o REPEAT FOR EACH RECORD
o Pour the 16 oz's of cleaning fluid through a filter in the funnel back into its container.

OPINION
o The system works well, but will not remove all traces of contaminants on the LP.
o It is faster and just as good as wet cleaning by hand.
o The record clamp is a great idea and makes the handling of the records easier.
o The drying rack is genius. It provides an input queue and a drying rack.
o The cleaning fluid provided is good, but you can easily make your own. I use distilled water, isopropyl alcohol and a couple drops of dish-washing liquid.

It’s a near complete rip off of a long time available German product called Knosti Disco Antistat. Vinyl Styl is using the exact goat hair brushes and a slightly modified clamp. Even the funnel, funnel screen and filters are identical to the Knosti. But despite the modifications, problems with the design remain. The clamps are slightly larger than the Knosti and actually cover the label fully, plus they use an o-ring rubber washer on the clamp rather than the flat rubber style of the Knosti. This all sounds good, right? Problem is that neither design truly prevents the label from getting wet. The o-ring helps but does not eliminate the problem. Plus, the latest Knosti introduced a crank design that allows the user to rotate the record without having to touch it, whereas Vinyl Styl are using the old bit by bit rotation method.

Now, the big problem I have is their poor customer support. I purchased a unit from Amazon and received it without the brushes installed. They were tossed into the box like an afterthought, and when I put them in the unit they did not snap in or fit properly but remained very loose. When a record was pulled out of the unit, the brushes came with it. I contacted Vinyl Styl and they confirmed this was a manufacturing defect, that the brushes are supposed to be pre-installed and fit firmly. I sent the unit back to Amazon and got another, but it was from the same fulfillment center and had the same problem. Vinyl Styl said the distributor must have gotten a faulty batch. They said they would promptly send me a properly configured unit and then I would send them my defective unit. Well, that was the last I heard and follow up inquiries went unanswered, so I just sent it back to Amazon again for a refund and will do without. A shoddy ripped off design, manufacturing problems and poor customer service are not going to help Vinyl Styl’s reputation. Buyer be warned.",Shoddy rip off of another product and the company has poor customer service,https://www.amazon.com/Vinyl-Styl-Groove-Record-Washer/product-reviews/B01M0LRLM5/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Scott Davies,washer_#N/A_B01M0LRLM5_Scott Davies_351_1985, , ,AM,

I've watched demo vids on the Spin Clean as well as the Deep Groove, and it's clear that the latter showcases a superior construct. The wet-clean process also enables my old records to sound reborn again in every aspect.

Comes with a 16oz bottle of cleaning fluid but it uses half a bottle to fill the reservoir so even with filtering to recycle it you will have fluid losses so may not get as many re-uses as one would hope for.

Stackable Model # GUD27ESSJWW
The ""one star"" was given because a value for overall rating was mandatory. If I had a choice, the overall rating would be -5 stars.
DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE EVEN IF GE PAID YOU!! The 1st new unit was installed on 12/17/16 and had increasing problems. First problem: washer spin cycle was so loud it sounded like the rotors of a helicopter on full throttle. Second problem: machine stops mid-cycle during the spin cycle. Third problem: spin cycle would not stop and kept going for another 20 minutes and had to be stopped manually. Called GE about the problems. Was told that we would receive a call from their service person to schedule service. Never received a call back from anyone. When service was finally scheduled, it was at least a week later and after multiple requests by the dealer. Serviceman diagnosed it as a transmission problem. Since it was a new machine, we requested GE exchange the broken machine for a new one. Request was denied. Reason? They said the machine was under warranty. But who in their right mind would want to keep a new machine that comes broken?!! Spoke to Terry at GE Customer Relations Dept. who said there is no way we could proof that the machine came off the delivery truck broken. What is she insinuating...that we broke the machine on purpose because we want to sit on the phone waiting for over half an hour to speak with someone? After weeks, the dealer was finally able to exchange the broken machine for a new one. The second new machine came today and was installed. Guess what! It is still broken. This time it is the dryer. During the dry cycle, when the drum is rotating, a rhythmic loud noise comes out of the side of the machine, like a hammer banging. We will be contacting GE AGAIN! What happened to quality control? GE should compensate us for time spent waiting on the phone to speak to a GE rep, time away from work waiting for their service person, and frustration and angst from this entire experience.",Horrible Machine and customer relations service,https://www.amazon.com/GE-GUD27ESSJWW-Unitized-Spacemaker-Electric/product-reviews/B00W4KJO4M/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,King,washer__B00W4KJO4M_King_359_2013, , ,AM,

I even put my queen size comforter in it and, aside from having to push down the top a little at first to get it wet and working with the rest, it plowed right through and didn't skip a beat. The agitator does a great job and rolls the clothes around like they are nothing. I love the air dry feature, since I have a small dryer. When I have to do multiple loads I can run the air dry feature until the dryer is done with the first load, allowing for a shorter dry time on the second load. I also really like the fact that it has a hot water outlet. If I ever move to a place that has washer and dryer hook ups, that will be very useful.

They are expensive, heavy, and take up a ton of space. While I do have 3 children, I felt that we needed to downsize. I read lots and lots of reviews about these portable washers and decided this was the way to go. The 1.6 seemed too small so I went with the 2.1. This washer is amazing! It was easy to set up, but the instructions on how the machine operates and the different cycles is HORRIBLE! It's confusing at best. Anyway, I was able to lift and set up the washer by myself. It's soooo light compared to the one I got rid of! I have a cart underneath it as other reviewers have mentioned and I think it's a good idea. It gives the machine a little height and enables one to see underneath the washer.
I have done about 6 loads today. All Full loads including an adult sleeping bag. (My old washer died and the clothes had been piling up!). It has gotten the clothes just as clean, if not cleaner, than my then expensive front loader. It's quiet and efficient and small. I really like the fact that you can't overload this one. My kids would shove so many clothes in the other washer that they barely got clean. The agitation is also efficient and really gets the job done. I'm so pleased I went with this style and particularly this machine!","So far, so good!",https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Chef-MCSTCW21W3-Topload-Compact/product-reviews/B01N995WDY/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,M.
