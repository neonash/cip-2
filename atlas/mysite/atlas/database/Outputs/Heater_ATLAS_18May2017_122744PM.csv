It has built in baseboard heating that I used over the 2015-2016 winter. With the baseboard system I heated my bathroom and bedroom only to keep costs down. My monthly electric bill was $120. This past 2016-2017 winter I just set this heater up in a corner and let it run, turning it off when I left. It took 2 or so hours for it to really heat up my entire apartment, but it kept me comfortable and was barely noticeable. Not too noisy. I didn't need to wear my jacket around the apartment anymore, which was nice. The best part, my monthly electric went down to $80 during the cold months I needed it.

The only con is that the tower scrapes along the base when it is oscillating, which can be annoying to listen to. Because I set it in a corner in the kitchen I didn't need to have it oscillating, so it was fine.",Heats a small apartment well,https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-5307-Oscillating-Ceramic-16-Inch/product-reviews/B005M03ER4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Sam Marsh, , ,AM,

We have used this for 3 fall/winter months in a poorly insulated bedroom that is 16' x 12' and it keeps it perfectly warm all the time and can make it really toasty when you need that heat blast. I love that it turns off automatically at the right temperature or if it gets knocked over or tipped. And it works to cool the room down with the fan feature when you want the room cooler.

 ,Stiebel Eltron,Heater,"Stiebel Eltron’s elegant surface-mount CK heater is perfect anywhere quick heat is needed. Designed and made in Germany, this quiet fan heater quickly warms an area or maintains a comfortable temperature. Perfect for both retrofit and new construction, the European downdraft design heats a space evenly. CK heaters easily replace older flush-mount heaters and are ideal for bathrooms, basements, offices, playrooms, 3-season porches, cabins, campers or RVs, and mobile homes. The built-in fan is extremely quiet in operation at only 49.7 dBA. A thermostat with an adjustable knob for setting temperature is located on the right side of the CK. In rooms larger than 215 sq. ft., the CK can be operated through a conventional wall-mounted room thermostat. The CK is designed with a frost-protection setting. The lowest thermostat setting will maintain above-freezing temperatures in an appropriately sized space. The external casing is made of stove-enameled sheet steel. The sides are made from plastic. The CK heater is designed to have its components recycled at the end of its useful life. Stiebel Eltron is a world-leading German manufacturer of technically sound products since 1924.
CK 15E is 120-Volt, outputs 1500-Watt, draws 12.5 Amp, and must be hardwired

The oscillating feature distributes the heat evenly so there are no ""cold spots"" in the room. This isn't just an/off type heater. There are several choices for heating - Hi/Low fan, oscillate, no fan, thermostat, and timer. It's also very quiet. I ran out of heating oil and was very worried about being cold. This heater is not only efficient, it's given me peace of mind.

It does a superb job! I am disabled, so the remote control is a very handy feature. Its relatively quiet and does not bother me when i watch tv. The real test will come later on when the temperature drops around 0 degrees. I suspect that it will do fine. This heater had a high review rating, and my buying decision depends a lot on these reviews.I like the idea of the fan shutting off after it reaches a preset temp.The power cord is ample long enough for my needs.The heater works well on the floor as the digital reading can be seen easily. The heater can be placed on a table but the higher up you place it. the harder it is to read the temperature as the readouts are on top. With the heater set on automatic, using the remote its easy to drop or raise the temperature even when i'm half asleep and in the dark. This is a very well made heater and i would very highly recommend it to anyone who wants a durable heater that should last a very long time.","I use this heater in a small room (8' x 12').
