It was packaged well, with enough Styrofoam to protect it from standard shipping abuse. It was not difficult to set up, though it was a little time consuming. Overall, it took me about 20 minutes to unpack and install everything. It comes with extensions for the exhaust. It is also heavier than it looks, (which is not a bad thing) having a large amount of metal in it. I did my first two loads of laundry with it. 3.75 cubic feet doesn't sound like a lot of space, but it is more than it sounds like. Where I live, the coin op laundry uses the so called ""water efficient"" washing machines that only use 1/3 to 1/2 the water per load, but to get things cleaned, you have to either wash them 2 to 3 times or wash your clothes in very small amounts (""water efficient washing machines"" is an oxymoron.) With that said, this dryer fits a little more than a single load from those washing machines which is about 1/2 to 1/3 less than the accompanying dryers in the coin op. Based on the cost of electricity vs. the cost of the coin op, this will cost less to operate than using the coin op dryers. I also have a cat that is currently shedding a lot. This dryer did a better job of removing the cat hair from my clothes than the coin op dryers (probably because the drying cycle takes longer, allowing more time for the dryer to remove the hair.) The high heat setting on this dryer is temperature that is between the low and medium heat settings of a standard dryer, so it does take more time to dry things. That and smaller capacity are the only down sides I have found. However, for use in an apartment without washer/dryer hookups and a dedicated space for them, that is minor trade-off for the smaller foot print. It is also surprisingly quiet, so I could easily start a load drying and go to bed without being disturbed by it. Overall, this is a really nice appliance to have. I wish I had bought one much earlier. My cat was even scared by it's operation. He did his careful examination form a distance, then got closer and now he's sleeping on top while it runs. I think the minor vibrations are relaxing to him. Cats are both curious and humorous.",A truly convenient appliance to have.,https://www.amazon.com/Panda-Portable-Apartment-stainless-Window8-8lbs/product-reviews/B0092JSGXI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Techno Wizard,dryer_Panda_B0092JSGXI_Techno Wizard_413_2194, , ,AM,

She used to hang up her clothes either outside or in her basement. This became impossible as the aides had to change her sheets and cloth bed pads daily; additionally, it was used for daily bath towels, and clothes. Through all of this it has lasted a little over 3 years. We just re-order it.

What ultimately happened is the ball-bearing broke. When my husband took the back of the dryer off there were little steel balls just loose in the back.

It cleans my clothes better than anything. I use an oxy laundry detergent but just a dab because you don't want anything too sudsy. I usually use cold to temperate water unless it's socks and undies then I let them wash, sit for 5 mins and wash again. Sparkling white. The washing cycle agitates wonderfully and the spin cycle almost completely dries the clothes. They're barely damp. I turn on my fan and they are dry in a half an hour. I have to put the machine up on a small table that's about the same height as my bathtub because there's no pump to get the water out of the machine, it drains via gravity. I thought about buying a small pool pump but for now it's fine. I've saved 30 dollars a week not going to the laundromat anymore and it's convenient and easy to use. I let it dry after I'm done (keeping the lids open) and I spray it with lysol because I don't want mold to grow on it. Also, keep the lint filter clean after every wash before you rinse so you don't get the fuzz on the clothes in the rinse cycle. I use my long hose hand held shower head to fill it but it has leads for a small hose. My sink would work but it doesn't come apart to attach a hose. I've never had a leak with this item and I did buy a warranty just in case. But so far all is great!!!!! I've recommended this to other people as well.",... a year and I have to say I am amazed with it,https://www.amazon.com/Giantex-Portable-Compact-Washing-Machine/product-reviews/B01ALBMIEI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,J.

It's hard to get all the soap out of it you even drizzle just a little bit of soap into your clothes and a lot of soap doesn't want to come out seems like you have to rinse and spin them multiple times and even then it might not all come out and that's using about half a teaspoon of soap,Not that great,https://www.amazon.com/Giantex-Portable-Compact-Washing-Machine/product-reviews/B01ALBMIEI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Lena K Angel,dryer_Giantex_B01ALBMIEI_Lena K Angel_125_586, , ,AM,

This little washer packs a mean punch. I love it. I have 2 small children so laundry builds up fast. I am not a fan of laundromats and there is no washer and dryer connection in my apartment. This machine is small, but gets the clothes cleaner than any washer I have ever used. Yes, the hose doesn't fit on any faucet in my apartment.. Lol. But is an easy fix with a quick trip to your local hardware store. I seen someones review on here where they used a turkey baster as a water hose adapter.... That works as well.. Lol. It is well worth the money.. I received the machine clean and in perfect shape. I've done well over 10 loads in one day, with no issues. Only a little soap is needed... and for draining convenience, I suggest you put the machine in the bathtub, if possible. I will be purchasing a mini/portable dryer, so no more laundromat for me (unless I'm washing blankets)... I recommended anyone interested to purchase this product, its so convenient and does an amazing job.
