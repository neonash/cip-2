To fix this take the SD Card out put it into a card reader on your PC and use a Disk Partition app and redo the partitions with default options and reformat it with default options. You can then put it back into the phone and this time select to use it as external storage. It may want to reformat the SD card again that is fine.

It is pre-loaded with adware that cannot be removed: banner ads as well as full-screen ads. A factory reset revealed that the adware was indeed pre-installed (before the reset, I had only installed two extremely reputable apps, so I was certainly not the source of the adware).

Some Googling showed that others have had the same experience with the same pre-installed adware. One Amazon review from three months ago referencing the adware even has a response from BLU: acting as if they didn't know the adware -- that took me less than 10 minutes to track down -- came installed on phones they themselves sell. Absolutely disgusting.

I have gone ahead and changed all passwords for all accounts accessed through this phone: if there's adware, spyware is not an unrealistic concern. Indeed an internet search shows this is a very real worry -- I have not investigated for myself, but better safe than sorry. If you want peace of mind after buying this phone, that's what you're going to have to do. Not a very positive aspect of the purchasing experience.

I will start off by saying, I have the Prime version and have not found the ads to be annoying or overly intrusive. With that out of the way,...

This phone has an amazing boot animation with shows off the color depth and range of the screen. Setting it up was easy, like you would expect and without any hiccups. I was coming from a Moto X Pure so I had some expectation of being under-whelmed by the phone. However, I must say I have been pleased with the performance of the SOC and the UI is very intuitive. The Moto Gestures are still in the UI, ""chop for flashlight, twist for camera"" and the ""Moto Display"" is still there. However, coming from the X Pure, this phone lacks the IR sensors to detect a hand wave over the screen, so your actually have to move the phone in order to get the Moto Display to come on.

At first I was a little disappointed with the 5.2"" screen, because I felt I was losing some screen real estate coming from the X Pure. However, there is the nifty One Button Navigation which takes away the on screen navigation keys and allows you to do everything with the finger print scanner. So, it felt like I gained most of that 0.5"" back, when I turned on the One Button Nav. Once you get used to using the One Button features and gestures, going back to on screen buttons feels very awkward and cumbersome.

The one almost complaint I would have about the phone, is that you have to be very particular when selecting an SD card if you want the phone to use it as internal memory. I thought I had picked out a card which was fast enough, however I kept getting various application errors and would sometimes have issues with the devices I had Bluetooth connections with.

This phone would have to be one of the best mid-range devices on the market at the moment. And for the price, with or with out the Prime ads, it is a great value for the money.

One thing the buyer should be aware of, is that Moto/Lenovo seems to have gotten behind on their security patches and software updates. So if this is important for you, it might be something to consider. The unit I have, is still running Android 7.0, the kernel version is from Feb 6, 2017 and the Security Patch is from January 1, 2017

**UPDATE** Upon rereading my review, I realized I had not mentioned anything about the camera quality. I have to say the camera takes really good pictures, especially for this price point. While it does have the same sensor as another ""flagship"" phone, do not expect it to take flagship level pictures. However, both of the cameras do really well in regards to pictures.",Great Value and Features,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-5th-Generation-Lockscreen/product-reviews/B01NBRN2YI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Ray G.,smart phone_#N/A_B01NBRN2YI_Ray G._495_2692, , ,AM,

Previous phone was a Samsung. The Moto G line is probably the best budget phone out there for the features it offers. The speed is good for start-up and shut-down. The camera is nice and takes good quality photos. I recommend that folks considers these phones versus the higher price tag phones based upon their intended use and features they want. The nice feature is the fingerprint unlock so now the toddler cannot easily grab the phone and mess with it.,It's better dollar for dollar than your IPhone,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-5th-Generation-Lockscreen/product-reviews/B01NBRN2YI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,JFG,smart phone_#N/A_B01NBRN2YI_JFG_98_532, , ,AM,

After initially considering the $700 or so iPhone from Verizon, and I heard the new one in a few months will be around $900, I decided to do some research. Not only did I decide on a different wireless company but also decided on the Moto G Plus and I couldn't be happier on both counts. The Moto screen is larger than the iPhone 6s and seems to be perfect for me... any larger and it would be too big. I love the fingerprint unlock and downloading apps without connecting a cable to my computer and iTunes is great. The iPhone 6s cannot do all of that. It has other great features that I like, such as putting the phone face down if you don't want to be disturbed or picking it up to change it from ringing to vibrate or shaking it twice to turn the flashlight on or off, and many more. Finding out about features like that was easy since there is a Moto app on the phone that walks you through helpful features. If the iPhone did these thingsI never knew for five years since Apple doesn't communicate those things. Bottom line is I like the Moto much better and save hundreds of dollars also. Why the iPhone costs four times much is beyond me. And for those interested, I'm using Republic Wireless. The coverage has been great so far and I got the $20 a month 1 GB service. There are less and more expensive plans available depending on data use.",I love the Moto G Plus 5th generation compared to the iPhone I had,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-5th-Generation-Lockscreen/product-reviews/B01NBRN2YI/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Winestone,smart phone_#N/A_B01NBRN2YI_Winestone_274_1437, , ,AM,

Unfortunately, some people will buy this phone (for around 50 dollars) and expect to somehow get a Galaxy S8, and frankly those folks are going to be disappointed. HOWEVER, for what it is supposed to be, it’s great. This is most definitely a product for a specific kind of cell phone user. If you happen to that kind of user, you will really like it.
It comes with a somewhat “conservative” quad core processor, so don’t expect miracles with respect to processing power, but most games and limited multi-tasking will be OK. The 8 GB of built-in storage is decidedly on the lightweight side, and that actually only gives you about 4 GB for your own stuff out of the box, but the ability to add an SD Card and have Android “adopt” it to be internal storage makes up for that. It accepted an additional 32 GB for me with no complaints. Storage problems solved.
An earlier version of this device sort of, maybe, kind of, perhaps barely had enough RAM to run Android Lollipop, and it would on occasion limp along noticeably while it did. The Virtue Pro comes with 1 GB of RAM, which is more than enough to do a very acceptable job of running its fairly lean Android Marshmallow build, along with a concurrent app or two, even if it may not set the world on fire while doing so.
Dual SIM capability almost seems like gilding the lily on a device like this, but it is in there. Actually, it is difficult to find ANY cell phone these days that doesn’t support dual SIMs. Bluetooth works rather well, but USB OTG and screen casting are not going to be found. Battery life is OK, although maybe not spectacular. If you are going to be talking non-stop all day long and expect that to happen on a single charge, this may not be the phone for you. It does charge quickly enough that you could top it off without too much trouble. It is NOT 4G LTE, but it DOES support the lower end of 4G speeds with HSPA+ (think 3G on steroids). If you’re going to use it with Netflix or any other streaming service, perhaps better to do it over a Wi-Fi connection, although I was pleasantly surprised at how well HSPA+ can actually do in a pinch.
The tiny screen has decent resolution and good picture quality as long as you aren’t expecting full HD. The tiny control buttons could be a bother if, like me, you have LARGE hands. The screen also seems to be a really effective fingerprint dirt and smudge magnet, so it might require more frequent cleaning. The camera functionality is good for casual photos and selfies if you are so inclined. Sound quality on voice calls is decent as well. It doesn’t have every feature under the sun, but the features it does have work the way they should.
It fits in your pocket with room to spare. The shell is made of some high impact plastic, which makes it incredibly light, and makes the TPU case most phones come with these days pretty much irrelevant. People who say it almost feels like a toy in their hands are quite correct. It comes with a (flexible plastic variety) screen protector pre-installed, although I would like to see tempered glass as an option since I prefer the tactile sensation of real glass on a touch screen. Everything you need is in the box. Just add a SIM Card (and an SD Card for extra storage) and you’re good to go.
It is a good music device for a long run, bike ride, or a trip to the gym. It’s amazingly light, and mine pairs flawlessly with my Bluetooth headset. It would be PERFECT to give to younger children for their first phone, not only because they have smaller hands, but because, well, things happen with kids and cell phones. Aside from losing them with regularity, kids sometimes accidentally manage to feed their first cell phone to their dog, or drop it in a swimming pool. I have personally known these things (and more) to happen. It’s probably better if it happens with a 50 dollar phone rather than a 500 dollar phone.
Heck, you could just keep one of these as a spare in case your uber-priced flagship phone decides to catch fire one day and you need a phone while waiting for the replacement. The Virtue Pro is a good phone, it is reasonably priced, and at the possible risk of contradicting the cell phone purists, it is a FUN kind of device.","Nice phone, nice price.",https://www.amazon.com/Figo-Virtue-PRO-4-0-Smartphone/product-reviews/B01NAII7JB/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,George Nezlek,smart phone_#N/A_B01NAII7JB_George Nezlek_792_4341, , ,AM,

Camera quality is moderate under weird lighting conditions, but for the majority of the shooting a normal person would do, it holds up. The front camera quality is above average, notice less problems there.

Almost missing a star since I've noticed some software glitches using Spotify on bluetooth and wifi connections. Sometimes the app won't 'see' devices (I have two Chromecast Audios and a regular Chromecast) to connect to over wifi or it'll randomly drop bluetooth connections to my car's stereo / have trouble connecting after I turn my car off and then back on again.

I only bought this phone because it comes with insane levels of customization for the UI. Being able to choose between an iPhone style app layout or Android stock or using your own launcher is pretty great.

This is the phone of choice for somebody who wants a moderately priced flagship killer. This phone comes with some amazing capabilities due to the EMUI OS.

The battery really dies overnight. I charge it on the morning and by midday it all ready at 25%. I would understand that if I where using it all the time, but really hate being on the phone all the time and basically use it for calls.

The volume turns on or off by itself, as if the buttons were stuck or something. I noticed that when that happens the turn off button wouldn't work so the screen would stay on. First time it happened I reset it and then it wouldn't turn on again. I plug it to the charger and after some time it turn itself on.

The some other stuff kept happening. It world reset by itself and when it turned on my apps where all rearranged. Some apps kept having trouble and get stuck with out working.

Those problems I would expect from a year old phone, but not a week old.

Over all, it sucks! I have an Asus Republic of Gamers and it works awesome! But maybe Asus should stick to computers.

The only good about this phone is the camera, but even that kept freezing.

It still works! except the gorilla glass 3 screen shattered. I plan to replace that screen for $20, since the LCD digitizer still works perfectly (ZERO dead pixels) and use it for a backup phone. But this gave me a perfect excuse to upgrade to the newest Zenphone ZS570KL.. With 4gb ram, my old phone would boot up faster than any of my coworkers I-crap, Samsung or LG phones. The new model features 6gb, and I expect that it will be even faster. The old phone would stream effortlessly any video from YouTube, Netflix, real time tv on the Xfinity app and Big10toGo app. With the increased specs, I am confident that this phone will outperform the old one. And please remember to compare apples to apples. The ZS570KL is the stripped down version of Asus flagship cell phone, but still will outperform any of the ""other guys"" flagship phones for $400-$500 less. And did I mention that I ran the previous phone over with a car TWICE and it STILL WORKED?
Asus customer service is well known across the IT industry. I did have the previous phone sent to Asus for a battery issue, and within 14 days, I received my phone back with a new battery AT NO COST. Shipping or otherwise. If YOU damage a product, do not expect Asus to replace it at no charge (although I personally know of a few cases that they have...). Anyone who deals in electronics or computer parts knows that Asus sets the industry standard in both qualityand customer care. Don't believe me? Call any computer repair or retailer, or even somewhere like NewEggs customer service and ask. The only negative responses on here were for the Zenfone 2 Laser cell phone, which did have issues.

I went along and connected my service to this phone and it did connect perfectly no issues there. The problems start 3 days after connecting this phone, for one the camera shutter sound can't be turned off, second my phone had a bit of a glitch when it came to recording there was always lagging, third, on the fourth day after connecting it it began to freeze up for a couple seconds at a times, but as a couple days went by it would freeze minutes at a time to a point where the screen would go white or the screen would take on its mind of its own. It started to freeze up multiple times through out the day until I couldnt risk it anymore because it began typing in the text messages and selecting photos to send out which OBVIOUSLY nobody wants to deal with, I printed a return label restarted my phone to delete all of my information which took 2 hours because it was basically a war with the phone to access it and actually be in control of the screen. Finally its in the return box, with all of my information deleted and of course still glitching.

This item is being sold as new when it's obviously refurbished.
1: Original product packaging was obviously opened and poorly resealed.
2. No product manual present in box.
3. Inside the phone were signs of handling; stickers partially peeled off, fingerprints.
4. ITEM IS DEFECTIVE; The touchscreen worked less than 50% of the time, and the battery life is atrociously short, and I can't tell if it's because the battery isn't new or if there's so much bloatware running in the background that it just consumes the battery.
5. OTHER DEFECT: the screen dimmer malfunctioned and would not maintain the brightness levels set by the user.

Came without all the stuff (stupid games, etc) that take up memory. Easy to operate, clear voice on both speaker for ear & other. Takes great pictures (for what it is) with a zoom function. And, it has reception in many places which are sketchy for it.

Battery life has been very good and I usually get at least 24 hrs out of a charge, but I don't leave either apps open or mobile data constantly on, except for when being used. I do leave wi-fi always on as well as rotate screen, etc. Of course, the more apps & functions I use, the shorter the time the charge lasts.

My only complaint is that the charging cable is cheaply made & two of them, both OEM, have failed.

I bought this phone honestly not sure what to expect from the call quality since I saw it was only ""partial coverage"". When I saw that I was like eh I don't call people talk to people through text so eh that's whatever. In regards to the 4G LTE being partial I haven't noticed any problems. I bought this because the size of the screen mainly and also being on a pretty recent Android OS. Right out of the box. As soon as I bought it I was able to update to Android Marshmallow.

Call quality. This is my biggest concern now. I bought this phone expecting the call quality to be good enough and where I could get away with it. Sadly I was was majorly wrong. On T-Mobile people say I am super far away from my phone even though it is right next to my ear and I am talking at a normal level. Now that I am job hunting and getting calls from week to week it has bothered my dad so much that he gave me his old Nokida Windows phone to use when doing phone calls. I was kinda expecting Alcatel to somehow patch or update this phone so that the call quality on T-Mobile would be better but nope.

Size- I have very small hands so 4.7in is amazing. I love being able to use it in its entirety with one hand. That is the main reason why I bought his phone. All the phones now a days are huge for me with their 5.5in screen. I do not like having to do hand gymnastics to swipe down from the top.

*Taken from Obi Wans review since I agree with what he said.* The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc)

Processor/ Ram. The phone lags a bit when playing Love Live Sunshine if I am playing for a while. I did not test any other games.

Storage- 16 gigs is more than enough for me. I installed a SD card encase I ran out of space and wanted to add music onto it.

Photo quality. It takes nice photos. More then what I need for my Instagram. @Nick2D2

Video quality. In sunlight very good. In dark very poor. It does not process low light well at all.

4GLTE Partial Coverage - In regards to the 4G LTE being partial I haven't noticed any problems

With all of that aside. I would recommend this phone if you like to call people instead of texting and are not on T-Mobile.",Coming from a T-Mobile user.,https://www.amazon.com/ALCATEL-OneTouch-Idol-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B0118EWIXS/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Nick2D2,smart phone_#N/A_B0118EWIXS_Nick2D2_482_2521, , ,AM,

They sent me a flyer to upgrade my phone at a fee, that I checked out was the same as if purchasing a new phone. Their support is not the best and they definitely dont stand behind their products. They never even asked me to send in the defective phone, said they didnt have parts on a phone they send me 3 months ago, and yes it was a different phone from the one i first purchased.

The dual speakers are great. Camera is good, plenty of storage, and it is such a good size. My problem is that with both phones, when I have upgrade from 5.0 to 6.0 software something corrupts the sound and video ability. Videos will play at almost twice the speed if they play at all. And then the amazing speakers will not play any audio for music, podcasts, or videos. But the phone will ring (although it sounds buggy, not normal rings or alarms, they sound... just strange) and you can still talk on the phone with people. So some part of the update corrupts part of the AV of the phone. And from what I can find no one has been able to fix this in any way.

I was coming from an Android 2.3, so I was dying for an upgrade. I also needed it to have attractive hardware, decent speakers, be unlocked, and not too big, which is surprisingly hard to find because lots of phones these days are practically tablets. This phone met all my needs and more. My only compliant is the God-awful camera. I knew this before I purchased it. I know that's what had to be sacrificed to sell this phone at such an affordable price. But I really wish there was some way to improve the camera without having to go out and get a bulky add-on lens.

I've had mine for over a year now and I still love it. That's impressive for me because I usually want to replace my new phones less than six months after purchasing it. I did have one problem with it about seven months into owning it where it would automatically shut off, but it was still in warranty so I sent it to the Alcatel tech support and had it back in eight days working as good as new. I think I can still send it to them for additional repairs, but at a fee now, and that is so valuable to me.

If you're looking for an unlocked GSM phone that does the basics, is super light, isn't huge looks good, and comes with a warranty and you're willing to deal with a terrible camera, I'd recommend this phone.","Over a year later, and I still love it!",https://www.amazon.com/ALCATEL-OneTouch-Idol-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B0118EWIXS/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Karjiana,smart phone_#N/A_B0118EWIXS_Karjiana_255_1334, , ,AM,

Sure, I can go to the App Store and look for a camera app that allows you to do cool moving photo like iPhone, but they all want access to my phone (why, I ask, should an app be given permission to view my email or any other phone app and file just so I can take a picture with your app?). Why isn't this app pre-loaded with LG software (that has 3-4 second moving photo)?

I needed a phone with a more reliable GPS, and the NFC option (for things like Android Pay) greatly enticed me (though I've yet to really try it out just yet). After having the phone a few days, here are my thoughts:

+ The Xperia L1's GPS includes GLONASS (Russian satellite support), something the entire Moto G series desperately needed. Satellite lock is almost instant and very accurate. The L1 also has a magnetometer (digital compass) which was absent in the Moto G series.
+ The Xperia L1's screen, while lower pixel density (267ppi vs 294 on the G4 Play), has much better color saturation. The screen is also half an inch larger, ideal for using Nougat's multi-window mode.
= The L1's 13MP camera is about on par with the Moto G4 Play's 8MP camera when using auto-focus. However, the manual shot mode on the L1 does appear to have a decent array of options which might give it a competitive edge in the hands of an experienced photographer.
= The Xperia L1 comes with Android 7.0 out of the box, while the G4 Play claims it will update to 7.1.1 through standard OTA. Motorola has had numerous delays in deploying this update, hence the initial need to use a custom ROM. There aren't too many differences, honestly, and the L1 is already getting a steady stream of support updates, making them evenly matched in software.
= Bluetooth problems seem to be inherent on all Nougat devices right now, including Google's own flagship Pixel devices. The G4 Play running Lineage 14.1 will often disconnect from Bluetooth when connecting/disconnecting a Wi-Fi network, and phone calls on Bluetooth can occasionally force a reboot. Meanwhile, on the Xperia L1, the connection is stable but much shorter. Audio becomes finicky as far away as 5 meters on a device with a max range of 30 meters.
= The L1's USB-C connector is still using the 2.0 standard, giving it roughly the same data transfer and charge rates as the G4 Play's MicroUSB port. However, the Type-C port feels a lot sturdier than the old MicroUSB port, which justifies the necessity of newer (better) cables.
- The L1's MediaTek 6737T, despite having better benchmarks than the G4 Play's Snapdragon 410, has considerably more lag. This was a major disappointment for me as someone who uses their phone for EVERYTHING. Apps take a bit longer to open, and the keyboard has a slightly poorer response rate.
- The L1 has a glass screen with a hardness of 6. However, it's so thick that if you try and place a tempered glass screen protector on top of it, the touch screen struggles to register much of anything. This means you need to go without and be a lot more careful than you would need to be with the G4 Play, which happily accepts tempered glass screen protectors.

Is the Xperia L1 worth $200? I would say it's worth close enough to $200 not to matter. It more than makes up for the limitations of the Moto G4 Play, though it would have done better with a processor to match. It can beat out some phones in its class (like the Nokia 3), but other phones (like the upcoming Moto E4) might give it a run for its money (provided Motorola does not make the same mistakes twice).","Worthwhile if upgrading from an inferior model, but do your research.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-L1-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B06XGYQWZN/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,M.

I always thought the Xperia X could be iPhone 6 plus killer, everything is better on that phone compare to the iPhone. Camera (far superior with 23 MP rear), size and resolution. It is also less expensive than this phone, I paid $175 for it when it was on sale on Amazon.

In all respects, the Xperia L1 is a much lesser phone, but yet costs more. Cameras has less resolutions (13MP vs. 23MP) and feels plastic cheap in the hand. About the only thing that is better is the L1 uses USB-C for connection and charging, which is a better technology than micro USB. But that also presents a problem: you can find micro USB cable anywhere, but USB-C is a bit hard to come by. L1 also has less on-board memory, only 16GB instead of 32GB.

Android is also much more exciting than iOS, the radio app alone should be a key consideration. Something the iPhone world could only dream off. I took some pictures with the Sony X and they are phenomenal. If you need a phone now, Sony XPeria is a very good choice.

So I think if you are considering getting a Sony Xperia, look at the X.

My first Sony smartphone ever. I changed to Sony from iPhone followed Samsung. Really disappointed by the exterior design of Apple since Steve Jobs' death, or the terribly tuned Android System in the Galaxy S7. This L1 is so great that it makes me writing this long review, also my first review for online shopping. Sony's software engineers did great work making that Android System so comfortable and very user-friendly.

This L1 is cheaper than the other two phones, but it feels faster than my Galaxy S7, which has a lot better hardwares even is made 1yr before. There is no glitch or crash, and everything is so smooth to run.

I can only give 4 stars because of the camera. After all, it's an affordable smartphone, I don't expect too much. However, the camera is the only slow thing on this phone.

The phone is as big as the xperia x in a case (little bigger than I like but wife thinks its fine and the rounded back helps, the plus of this is the screen seems a lot bigger. Where the x has rounded corners and rounded front glass the L1 the front is flat making the front corners more square and have a sharper feeling (could be negated with case). The phone is easy to set up and responds well (signalwise in a rural Ohio with ATT) you may want to check what bands are available in your area, some of the other models support more (when setting up the phone in store took a little as they don't see many Sony phones and are unfamiliar and curious) It is fine for your internet browsing, you tube videos, calls, texts, etc. the lower ram does hurt it's performance if you are trying to watch movies on this. This phone also does not support fast charging if you are use to that it will seem like a step back. One thing Sony does that a lot of other companies do not do, is it has the FM radio unlocked, plug in headphones and you can listen to the radio (is not as big of drain on battery nor does it use data to listen unlike streaming, a nice plus) I would recommend this phone for people on a budget or looking for a basic phone and something different.

The sound quality is not too good. I can hear the other side, but sometimes not very clear. Watching videos is a pain because of the poor sound.

Is it as nice as my Xperia XZ? No. But it's still awfully nice.

Sony's design language is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing. Personally, I adore it. The L1 is reminiscent of my last Clie PDA, thrust into the future. Build quality is excellent for this price range, and quite good relative to more expensive phones. There were no creaks or gaps to speak of, and the display is clear and bright.

Their implementation of Android is not only current, but very thoughtfully left alone, for the most part. It isn't quite stock Android, but the UI very rarely gets in the way of letting you do things. Coming from an XZ, the slower CPU isn't too apparent in normal productivity use, but there is a substantial difference when you get into games and other apps that are more resource intensive.

While I'd normally complain about the tiny 16GB storage, the addition of a MicroSD slot (which aren't present on some flagship phones, let alone one in this range) is excellent. Dropping a 200GB SanDisk card full of media gave me hours to put this phone through its paces.

So, would I buy one? If money was a constraint, absolutely. I'm not giving up my XZ for it (and may still pick up the new XZ Premium), but as a replacement for a device that's two years old, or a first Android device, it's an outstanding choice.",I can't believe it's so cheap!,https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-L1-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B06XGYQWZN/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Kevin Nicholls,smart phone_#N/A_B06XGYQWZN_Kevin Nicholls_248_1392, , ,AM,

All of them were excellent but this is my favorite so far. I did not order this phone from Amazon, I bought it at a retail store because my most recent smartphone was misplaced and I needed a replacement immediately.

I generally do not run any background apps and always close them when not in use. I have noticed some minor bugs with all of them except this phone including some difficulty connecting to wifi networks when not in close proximity. They tend to show 3 or 4 bars of signal when detected but when I select ""connect"" it drops to one little dot and fails to connect. This will generally happen repeatedly until I either give up or move to better range of the router and it has been something I have learned to get used to but this doesn't occur with the L1. I think it has something to do with the new Mediatek processor.

I was always irked by the need to pair with my bluetooth headset anew on my MacBook Pro every time I had paired it to my previous Xperia models which I thought was caused by Apple unpairing from it, but I do not have that problem with this phone. It seemed a strange bug, and I just got used to it. Now I can switch back and forth from my devices with my bluetooth headset very quickly and smoothly.

I don't see the small apps when I tap the square and I don't miss them, now the square seems to only bring up background running apps so I can close them and save battery and performance. To me this is a welcome change. In all other ways it is the same old Sony user interface, simple, Spartan and neat. It has been the UI that has kept Sony Smartphones in my pocket for so long as my dependable tool in every situation.

The display isn't 4k. It doesn't seem to me to be necessary to have an extremely high definition display for a handheld device, even for consuming entertainment media. It just eats through the battery and costs a lot. The display is still quite nice and in fact, I have noticed another improvement over my previous Xperia phones. When I select the dimmest back lighting with the slider it is much dimmer than with those previous models. It always seemed to me to still be more than adequately bright on the dimmest setting before and I had wondered if I could extend the battery life yet more by having it dimmer. Now I can. The touch sensitivity seems to me as responsive as any previous Xperia model.

Very pocketable 5.5 inches. I have had a couple of phones which were excessively thin and have wondered if an extra couple of milimeters of thickness would be OK if it meant a slightly bigger battery. Well the battery is still only 2620 MaH. However with the toned down specs, smooth performance and average display it still seems to last as well as previous models if not better (excluding the T2 ultra which was just a beast). With the near lack of a bezel it is the perfect size for me as the T2 ultra was just too big.

Excellent build quality. The matte black version feels great in my hand and at this price point for an unlocked phone I suspect that negative reviews are paid for by competitors. It feels like a very high quality device and not at all cheap feeling like a Samsung phone. It is elegant and yet durable. For $200 US, this phone is peerless.

The camera is only adequate. This may be the most important detail for me. I am a photographer and I travel with several cameras and lenses, including some highly portable combinations so I simply have no need for an overblown and expensive smartphone camera. If I need to snap a quick shot of something, it is fine and has a flash in case lighting is insufficient for a shot. For those of you who need an incredible camera on your smartphone, I will try to keep my disdain to myself and suggest one of the models designed for selfies for your instagram but this model will achieve decent shots if you need it to.",Quality can be had affordably with a well considered design.,https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-L1-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B06XGYQWZN/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,CS Divetravel,smart phone_#N/A_B06XGYQWZN_CS Divetravel_737_3972, , ,AM,

There is a good deal of junk installed on the phone as it arrives and some of it can't be deleted (or I couldn't trivially delete it anyway).

-- Battery life has been pretty good, but during extended use-time or while it's charging, the top half of the phone gets hot.

The protector wouldnt come off easily, and in the process of asserting some muscle to it the screen crumbled. So, after less than a year I am throwing it away.

This cell phone pouch is made from tough polyester with edging that is double stitched. The pouch that holds the cell phone is lined with a smooth material that will resist scratching the cell phone screen. However, since the pouch does not completely enclose the cell phone it is still subject to dust, dirt, sawdust, etc. which could eventually cause scratches to the screen. My cell phone measures 3"" wide by 5 3/4"" long and was a snug fit. The pouch includes a small notebook, 2"" X 4"", with approximately 50 sheets of gridded paper and a small flat style pencil. See Photo 1 and 2. The only negative I had was the belt clip. The clip is a flat piece of spring metal that was difficult to put on over a belt and more difficult to get off.

My Android phone was snug in the pouch. In fact it was a bit difficult to pull the phone back out until I figured out that I can nudge it up from the bottom of the pouch.
The pouch protects the phone very well from bumps or hits however it does not provide much protection to the phone from dusty environments such as sheetrock work or saw dust.
The Velcroed enclosure flap holds the phone and note pad in securely without too much fear of the flap lifting unintentionally.
The design of the case was well thought out with pouches and loops. The loops could hold small hand tools such as small screwdrivers with pocket clip. The note pad and pouch is a nice idea but as stated before, not ideal in dusty conditions. The pouch size is adequate.

She only had 3 pics, 5 apps and a handful of contacts and the phone would constantly remind her that the storage space was running low, it says on the box you get up to 8GB of memory but you actually only get 4GB because of all the junk they have using up the memory and  you couldn't shut the reminder off, when she would try to go on any of her apps it wouldn't even let her on anything even though the space wasnt completely used up it was only running low, and then it froze up, i had to take it to an Att&amp;T store to have it reset because i didn't know how to do it, and buying a SD card is only good if you want more pics on your phone, its no good for apps. So after the reset she could only put like 3 apps back onto the phone. Also I noticed in another review someone had problems answering phone calls,  we had that problem as well. When someone was calling you could tap, swipe, whatever and you could not answer the dang incoming call!! how frustrating!! So yea this phone isnt even good for a 10 year old!!

The camera is pretty mediocre, but did a fine job when I went on a road trip without a good camera, even with photos of scenic mountains.

i will keep this phone a year or so then i will trade up. i had the gophone windows nokia lumia and it had tons more storage on it, i had numerous apps. i only traded because fb messenger app is no longer available to windows phone. so i got this express 3 about 3 weeks ago and i have already had to unmount my sd card and remove all my pics and delete some music in order not to run out of space, no room on this phone for games or much media. i am very disappointed. do your research and if you are going with a gophone find one with more storage. also, my onedrive is very slow to upload, i went to a concert and had to wait almost 14 hours before all my photos and videos uploaded to one drive, then i had to share them, save them to my pc and delete as i was getting low storage warnings. this is def not the phone for anyone who likes taking videos/pics.",like apps/storage keep looking,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Samsung-Galaxy-Express-3-GoPhone/51352483,vjb30,smart phone_Samsung_51352483_vjb30_245_1209, , ,WM,

The battery last at least two days with average usage.  The S3 mini had to be charged every night.  With only 8 gig memory though, there is not alot of room left on the phone, but it does have a slot for a memory card which is where the pics automatically load to so it is not an issue for me.  If you need more memory, go with the Samsung Galaxy Express Prime, it comes with 16 gig and a 5 inch screen, I just did not want that large of a phone.

Really good.  As of now, I am listening to songs ported through the phone's headset jack to the Aux port on my car stereo.  The phone's advanced sound options do more harm than good, for me, so I am happiest with those features dis-abled.  The phone acts like a high end model but with less sensors.  No compass app will work but you'll never be lost...this phone has GPS and turn-by-turn direction apps, namely AT&amp;T Navigator and Google Maps.  The phone has enough memory for essential apps only, so plan on spending $20 for a fast micro SD memory card.  An example, the SanDisk 32 Meg extreme U3, currently selling for $18.  If card is not fast enough..... phone will reject it.
Battery is good and you can replace it yourself without the need for the cost of a tedious phone repair expense.  Phone operates on current Marshmallow operating system which is peppy and will run your favorite games and banking apps.  Keep in mind purchasing the $20 micro SD memory card with it.  I wish I had.  Good WiFi and calls sound good.  Visual voicemail app does not work so I use Google Voicemail app and it works.  Otherwise, press and hold the 1 key to access your voicemail....easy peasy.
Windows users... Cortana app works great on this phone and you can activate her by pressing and holding the Menu key.  Office apps such as Word available.  Some cool looking glass launcher themes are available for transparent, glass-like buttons.  If you still miss live tiles on Windows phone, you can add widgets to this phone so reallly...you can call in love with a non-Windows phone that Will sync with your PC.  Colors on this display are so beautiful they seem to glow.  My sensors are pleased as is my mind with this GALAXY EXPRESS 3 AT&amp;T GOPHONE.

I bought it thinking, hey, this is a samsung...must be good right? Well, it was for the first couple weeks...then it became slow and unresponsive at times. The Phone itself isn't bad, the body design is light and small enough to fit in your pocket without feeling like you're carrying a brick, (I'd advise a case, as the phone feels like a feather might break it). But then comes the internal design...the fun part. The processor starts out good, but after a couple weeks...well it's like the phone's running on XP, it slows down. If you're using the phone for texting and calling, it'll work just fine, but if you're looking for something to play games on or video chat...keep walking this phone is NOT for you. The camera is sub par quality, the speakers are not very loud, even with a volume booster it's hard to hear most music/videos. The text's can be responsive at times,but if you let the screen sleep and have the text open, you'll need to reopen the screen to see if you have a new one...as it won't notify you. The music volume on their...is well, decent if you have good headphones, but that's really it. If you're looking for a phone that can run pokemon go, keep moving you'll load then never move. I've also had to do about 2-3 factory resets on the phone and mind you I've got a anti-virus,cleaners and defraggers on there. STILL runs slow. If you're looking for a decent cheap phone, go for the LG Phoenix 2, it has better specs and will probably last longer.

Pros-Cheap,stylish,smooth case
Cons-Slow after short usage,cheap processor,overheats,low volume

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT YOU CAN NOT HEAR THE OTHER PARTY WHEN YOU ARE ON A PHONE CALL.  No matter how loud the volume is up you and not hear the other person clearly.  You will have to use the speaker mode or the ear piece.

It has pre installed apps that isn't removable which a sd card seems to help.  There isn't any type of case made for it that actually fits it properly and the screen is easily cracked, I was playing a drum simulator app on it and wasn't tapping on the screen where mine is cracked, and being a phone and not an actual drum set I wasn't tapping hard and the screen cracked. With that said and all, the phone ,screen and battery all still work. Also the carrier at&amp;t is a good service and have excellent plan options and helpful customer service and easy to use apps pertaining to at&amp;t only.

I was able to update it after setting it up, Im guessing it was an ATT update. The phone comes with Marshmallow 6.0.1 and it has asked for a lot of permissions. First phone I have used with Marshmallow, so it has taken me a little time to get used to it. Also my first Huawei phone and so far so good.

 So far it has run smoothly and the battery life is excellent. I don't play any games on the phone and rarely use it for music or video, so your battery life might vary. Its only dropped 35% in the last 13 hours....

The phone helped walk me through transferring my contacts, pictures, video and texts from my old phone to this one. ( wi-fi required ) I was thankful for that!

 My biggest concern was where to find a case? Luckily the Walmart it was purchased from had a case made by Body Glove for the Huawei Ascend XT for $20.
 I only saw 2 colors to choose from, black and dark purple (grape). Fits it really well and make me worry less. Its not the most fancy of cases but internet searching didn't find anything. 

Phone calls have been clear for the most part but I have noticed some calls sound kinda tinny coming through the ear speaker. As far as the main speaker its loud but doesn't sound the best turned up all the way, it also sounds tinny to me.

The phone apps scroll up and down, I prefer side to side but not a deal breaker. It comes with a little bloatware but most can be disabled. It installed the apps I use really quickly from playstore.

It comes stock with the Google Sound Search ( widget) which recognizes music thats playing and names the artist and song. I don't know if thats old technology but I thought it was pretty nice.

The camera offers a lot of options for taking photos and photos so far have turned out good. Ive included a photo of the case and package.",Nice phone and found a phone case to fit,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Huawei-Ascend-XT-GoPhone-Prepaid-Smartphone/54306979,Figure4,smart phone_AT&T_54306979_Figure4_352_1851, , ,WM,

Reviews were scarce at the time cause the phone was so new but I figured if Huawei was good enough for Google, then it should be good enough for me. Besides, at the BF price it was basically a disposable phone.  I should mention that I am NOT an AT&amp;T customer but instead use TMo, so to unlock the phone you must NOT turn on the phone with the included AT&amp;T Sim, which is nano sized, by the way. Instead, you go to their website - https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/ and enter the IMEI # and in 2-3 days they email you back the code. 
  So, now that I have my TMo sim card in the phone and turn it on, it will ask for the unlock code and after entering it, the phone is now on TMo. This phone has band 12 for 4g LTE so it is fully compatible. The phone is large, which I like, but not too large for my manly hand to handle. I also got a Body Glove case for it at Walmart but if you ask an associate about it, they may tell you they don't carry it, Just go look on the shelf where the universal cases are at and you'll probably find one. It says"" Huawei Ascend XT"" in BIG letters right on the front. It's a little pricey at $20, but it's the ONLY case available right now. Screen protector from Amazon and now I'm good to go.
  I like to use my phone with PdaNet (Paid Version) so that I can access the internet with my laptop or tablet from anywhere. It connects right away through USB or Bluetooth but is a little glitchy through Wifi. The screen is bold and beautiful and sufficient for watching Youtube videos. Volume is more than adequate. Call quality hasn't been an issue when I've used it , but I don't talk on the phone much anyways.
  The only negative I have with this phone is the UI that Huawei uses over the Marshmallow 6.0. It takes some getting used to. But overall, I am very happy with this phone purchase, so happy that I went and bought a second one so that I have a back-up - just in case I lose this one too.

Good: The battery is amazing. Runs Marshmallow. Decent camera. Runs apps with no lag. Sound/speaker quality is better than expected. Pretty impressive for the price. Screen quality is good.

Bad:The box says 16 GB internal memory, but it only has 8 GB. The ability to move apps to the sd card has been disabled by the manufacturer. I'm concerned about  not having enough rooms for apps. The phone comes with quite a bit of bloatware.  We disabled what we could, but it the apps cannot be removed. For these reasons, I gave it three stars.

Honestly, I am torn about this phone. For a starter phone, this is good. I wish it had the memory that it advertises. The body is all plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap. Currently, it's almost impossible to find a case for it unless you are willing to shell out $40 for sellers driving up the price on Ebay. Ironic, since most of us got the phone for $49 on Black Friday. I will update my review once we use the phones more.",Memory is not as advertised,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Huawei-Ascend-XT-GoPhone-Prepaid-Smartphone/54306979,GadgetGal74,smart phone_AT&T_54306979_GadgetGal74_186_1001, , ,WM,

- Phones comes with nano sim card, but porting your phone over is a breeze with a simple call to AT&amp;T.
- Android OS is somewhat current with Marshmallow 6.0.1 One update was detected on first check and installed successfully.
- Internal storage is limited to 16GB minus OS leaves you with 8GB. Then you subtract apps, etc.. I have less than 4GB free now. However SD card expansion fixes that issue as my 64GB card is supported. Storage is not an issue if you get an SD card.
- Phone is very responsive and display is crystal clear. 6"" is great
- Finding a phone case was challenging online. I ended up going with the more expensive Body Glove case available in WalMart store for $20 (which has worked great). Although I was looking for something online in the range of $4-7 but they just don't make them yet for this phone

I walked past the prepaid section and this device immediately caught my eye. The $150 price tag indicated that this phone might  have some considerable specs (for a Go Phone, that is) and when I saw that the phone had 2GB of RAM and 16 GB ROM, I knew I had to buy it.

That said, this phone is brand spanking new, so don't expect to be able to find any cases for it for a while. Heck, even AnTuTu benchmark was unable to verify what phone I was using. Google calls it a ""Copper Plus"", the box says ""Ascend XT"", but searches for ""H1611"" yielded the most results.

This phone has a 6"" screen. Plenty for me. I read some of the reviews and was a little worried about buy the phone. But Walmart had the phone on roll back for 76.00. so I couldn't refuse. I also purchase the insurance in case the phone started acting stupid. But so far, everything good. I don't know why some people are having problems with this phone. Unless they are doing things with the phone that they have no business doing with the phone like jail breaking or rooting. Maybe they downloaded some applications that ain't compatible with the phone and causing the phone to act stupid, Or they got a lemon. I did notice that the phone was a little slow in the beginning so I went into setting and found a setting to change the phone performance mold. Now the phone seem to be quicker. I would suggest getting an micro SD card to store music and videos on it because the phone has about 8gig of storage that is usable.the camera take good pictures for my liking. I'm not an professional photographer so I'm looking for high performance camera just something to take occasion pictures. Now I do have some complaints about the phone. But for 76.00 I really can't complain. This isn't a 800.00 Samsung Galaxy 8. But my complaints are the battery doesn't come out so I can't carry a extra battery with me. So I'll have to use a external battery pack. Also it's hard to find a protective case locally so I'll have to go online for it. And by biggest complaint is not with the phone, but with the service. I have the att go plan. And on the go prepaid plan, att has the hotspot disabled so u can't use the phone hotspot feature. So if you want to hotspot then don't get the go plan. U will need to get att contract plan.  I wish I would have knew that before I brought the phone. Would have look some where else. But I do love the phone though.

This phone is loaded for the price and very fast when making calls or sending texts. 
I've only had it a couple of weeks but am a heavy user due to my job. The battery lasts me 2 days before I need to recharge it. It fits easily into my hand despite a 6"" screen size and does not feel slick so I use no case. Still fits into my front pants pocket easily. Call quality is very good and music playback is good enough for me. Easily paired the bluetooth with my car audio. GPS works quickly and accurately.

It is a big phone, 6"" screen, so some may not like that but it ihas a bright, clear screen that is easy to see.  The battery life is amazing, I can definitely go all day without recharging, in fact I have actually gone 2 days and still had 24% left. The camera is good as well (even better than my Grand Prime), and the processor keeps everything moving smooth.  I gave it a 4 because even though it is supposed to have 16Gb of memory it only lets you use 8. The only other complaint is not really the phones issue but rather a supply issue ... cases ... there is very little selection at this point, although Walmart does sell a Body Glove cover that I am using along with the tempered glass screen protector, so there is a few options for now.

The setup process is easy and AT and T will transfer the SIM card for you for free if the SIM in your old phone is too big (like mine was).

The only thing I don't like so far is the call volume.  It's very low and muddled sometimes and forget putting it on speaker unless you want to hold the phone to your ear the entire time.  

We initially couldn't find a phone case but we ended up going Walmart hopping around town today since we have several and found black Body Glove cases for $19.97 that was specifically for this particular phone.

I figured I would end up giving it to the kids or using it to replace my failing B&amp;N Nook.  I was skeptical about how I would like it considering how I'm used to the Samsung Galaxy series, and I find most other phones to be lacking in the camera, screen quality, and general performance.  So I was very suprised by the Ascend XT.

The screen is good, earning at least an A- from me.  It's not 1080p, but I don't hold my phone 6 inches from my face and look for pixels.  Colors and contrast are good enough, and the outdoor visibility is good thanks to one of the best auto-brightness systems I've come across.  And it's an IPS display, so the viewing angles are great.

The camera is also good.  I give it a B+.  The 8MP hardware doesn't match the 8MP from my 5 year old Galaxy S2, but the images are decent.  Where the camera impressed me is the app itself.  The HDR mode was easy to use and does yield images that on par with my old Galaxy (which still works and I used for comparison).  It has a very easy to use voice activation for taking photos.  And it includes a document scanner (cropper) which I use frequently.

And for the performance we start the story with a slight disappointment.  It has 2GB of RAM and way more CPU cores that my old S2, but it was just barely faster.  Still good performance for the price, and way better than other budget phones.  But I was expecting more.  Then fast forward past a couple over-the-air updates, adding a high-speed SD card, and installing the Nova Launcher.  The phone is now noticeably faster and operates with more available RAM.  So it now impresses me with it's multitasking, responsiveness, and how it handles the light gaming I do.  It still won't keep up with the newest flagship models, but it blows away everything else I've seen for under $100.

As for bloatware - there's some, but I was able to remove or disable pretty much all of it very easily, and it wasn't really that bad to begin with compared to some other phones I've seen.

Durability is good.  I did get a screen protector, but do not use a case.  It's had at least 3 bad falls so far, and suffered only scratches on the corners.  

So my overall score is 5 stars.  Now, if I were to score it on the same scale one would use for something like the S8 or the Nexus phones, then I would rate the Hauwei Ascend at barely 3 strars.  But they aren't on the same scale.  Most flagships are at least 4 or 5 times more expensive than this phone.  So once you consider that this one is less than $100, it's an unbeatable value.",Surprisingly good phone; unbeatable value,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Huawei-Ascend-XT-GoPhone-Prepaid-Smartphone/54306979,Duncan,smart phone_AT&T_54306979_Duncan_511_2604, , ,WM,

The touch pad was a good size.  The things I rated it low on were: 1) The speaker is not good.  Way too much garble.  This makes it hard for my husband to understand what is being said.  If he doesn't put it on speaker phone, the volume doesn't go loud enough for him to hear well...unless of course the person on the other line peaks rather loudly.  2) The Hotspot turns off as soon as you disconnect your other device from it.  3) The mobile data turns itself on whether you want it on or not.

I wanted to get it as a backup phone in the event something happened to one of our other phones.  This phone is being sold as an AT&amp;T GoPhone and appears to be a Walmart exclusive, but it just as easily could be used on any of AT&amp;Ts plans.

So, here are my impressions of the phone.  I will start with the hardware.  The case of the phone is one piece plastic which has a nice rounded feel to it.  This phone feels and looks better than most plastic phones that I have seen.  The power and volume buttons are placed on the right side of the phone with the power button being just below the volume buttons.  This makes it easy to hit the volume button when going for the power button and vice versa.  The speaker is on the bottom of the phone and is nice and loud and has a good sound to it.  The screen is 6.0” and is 720x1280. I find the display to be quite good and bight.  The icons will be bigger on this phone than on another phone with higher resolution.  I did not have a problem with the display being only 720x1280.

The phone performs quite well in most circumstances, I did find some lag in typing on some web pages, but most were quite responsive.  I had no problems playing casual games and the phone handled games like Temple Run 2 quite well.  I couple of issues that I noticed were 1) sometimes when sliding from one homescreen to the next, the widgets would redraw on the homescreen that you are sliding to.  This is probably due to Huawei getting aggressive with battery life, 2)  it is too easy to tap the home button to go home or close an app and cause Google Now on Tap to launch if you have it activated.  This feature is supposed to perform a search related to what’s on the screen when you hold down on the home button.  I found it way too easy to activate this by just doing a normal tap on the home button.

Huawei has skinned Android with their eMUI 4.1 skin, which was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  There are a couple of things to note on this.  In the App drawer you cannot create folders and group your apps together, you can only do that on the home screen.  I am used to having shortcuts and notifications available when you pull down the notification shade.  Huawei separates outs the Notifications and the Shortcuts into 2 separate tabs. This means that you see more of your notifications, but if you want to toggle WiFi or some other service on or off, you have to tap the Shortcuts tab to do that instead of it being at the top of the notifications screen.  

One of the odd things I found on the Ascend XT was how they deal with the wallpaper.  The default lock screen wallpaper rotates between 20 different images and if you want to change the wallpaper on the lock screen, it has to be the same as the home screen.  There are 2 ways to get around this, one is to install an alternate lock screen app or to remove the contents of the MagazineUnlock folder and put your photo in there.  The photo has to be 720x1280 and named like the photos that you removed from the MagazineUnlock folder (hopefully you moved them to another folder and not deleted them).

This phone has a 3,000 mAh battery (which is non-removable) and it has no problem getting you through the day.  I have used this phone all day with a good 4 hours or more of Screen time and did not exhaust the battery.  This is probably due to the screen resolution being 720x1280, meaning it does not have to refresh as many pixels as some other phones with higher resolution and battery optimizations that Huawei is doing behind the scenes.  If you are not a heavy phone user, you could probably get two days use on a full battery.

The call quality on this phone is very good I had no problems with dropped calls and the calls sounded very clear.  The rear camera is an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash.  It takes good photos with plenty of light, but when things are a little darker you will see a lot of detail missing in the photo when you zoom in.  The Ascend XT will handle a 64 GB micro SD card without any problems.

So, what are my final thoughts on this phone, it is a good phone and it is worth getting at $100, which is Walmart current price on this phone.  With a $100 phone you are not going to get the quality, speed and refinement of a flagship phone that costs 7 0r 8 times more.  But if you are on a budget or don’t want to spend that $800 for the next best thing, give this phone a try.  My only regret is that I wish I had bought another one at the Black Friday price.",A very good phone at a great price,https://www.walmart.com/ip/AT-T-Huawei-Ascend-XT-GoPhone-Prepaid-Smartphone/54306979,Randy,smart phone_AT&T_54306979_Randy_925_4677, , ,WM,

2. The Body Glove case appears to be only sold at Walmart for $19.88.  The store I purchased it at and the store I frequent often are really busy stores and did not have them.

It is a little bigger than I expected, but I am getting use to it.

It is very responsive and works flawlessly with all the software I have installed on it.   The colors are very sharp and clear and the screen resolution is superb.   I originally bought this to be a 'fill-in' phone until the new microsoft phones come out, but as great as this has been I don't even feel the need to look elsewhere.  If anything I may be looking to get a high end Motorola phone cause if this phone is any indication of how well this company makes phone I can only imagine the high end ones are even better.

The Marshmallow operating system is what really saves the day with a lot of added and time saving features over Lollipop.
Durability is only fair as the old style wrap around frame is subject to denting and therefore cracking the screen which is made of gen 3 Gorilla glass.
Non slippy back is a good feature but in the end you will likely want to get rubberized impact protection.
Annoying features are its oversized for its small screen, the screen is for some reason a dust magnet while battery live is poor and charge time even when completely turned off....it recharges VERY slow.
Where it shines it phone sound quality and the ability to work well even with just one bar signal strength.
Also it has a very good camera which is a plus but somewhat odd considering.
Online performance is good IF you avoid the Opera browsers which really put a drag on internet performance, best browser for data saving and speed is the UC browser.
Overall for what it is it is a $29.00 phone at best so it is all about how bad you want it and wether or not you are using rose colored glasses.

This phone reluctantly replaces my favorite LG Premier because Verizon doesn't support it, but moving to the Moto from the Premier is like going from a BMW to a Fiat.",Very dated design,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Verizon-Moto-G-Play-Prepaid-Smartphone/53970798,Hamunaptrah,smart phone_Verizon Wireless_53970798_Hamunaptrah_250_1396, , ,WM,

When the data is on and your not on a call, your connection is 4G LTE. But when you get a call, the connection switches to a 1X connection and disconnects your data. My car relies on a always on data connection for my safety and Verizon restricting this is unacceptable. The actual sim that comes with this phone isn't even an authentic 4G LTE sim. I am really disappointed in Verizon.  From forums I have read I came to understand that post paid accounts are allowed the always on data connection but prepaid isn't. This is also a negative mark in my book. So don't waste your money if you are looking for a modern prepaid device. This one is from the caveman cell phone era.",No always on data connection for prepaid,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Verizon-Moto-G-Play-Prepaid-Smartphone/53970798,Shelley,smart phone_Verizon Wireless_53970798_Shelley_145_763, , ,WM,
