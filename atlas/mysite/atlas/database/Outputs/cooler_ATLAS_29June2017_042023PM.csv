Made from durable molded plastic, its ThermOZONE insulation is environmentally safe and uses Xtreme 5 Technology that keeps ice for up to five days.

A telescoping handle and two durable wheels make transporting a fully-loaded cooler effortless. The lid incorporates four molded cupholders and can support 250 lbs., allowing it to double as a seat. Choose between a black/gray or blue cooler (color options are subject to availability). About Coleman Company Inc. Fueled by poor eyesight and blind ambition, W.C. Coleman began his company with the invention of his gas lamps in 1905. Twenty years later, the company saw a country at war and an Army without adequate stoves. The Coleman pocket stove is today considered one of the two most important innovations in non-combat equipment in the war effort. It is this commitment to quality and innovation that continues to push the Coleman brand to create essential and reliable products that are convenient and easy to use.

I think it does keep ice a little longer than some others I've owned but there are definite things about it that I have problems with. Like many reviewers, I have issues with the handle collapsing when I try to use it. It's very difficult to move if you want to use the wheels. The wheels seem flimsy but so far have held together. My biggest pet peeve hasn't been mentioned by anyone else I've seen. I have a lot of trouble opening this ice chest. Maybe it's just me and I see a lot of other Coleman coolers have the same type of opening. However, lifting it is a challenge sometimes. It's especially hard at the end of a trip when the chest isn't very full and is light weight. The handles on the side don't stick out far enough for me to get good leverage.

THE PURPOSE:
I needed a reasonable size container that was heat efficient and cost effective for use wuth a sous vide circulator. A lid is required to retain heat and ensuring minimal water loss from evaporation.

THE SOLUTION:
For small batches, I use an 8 quart cooler (with a Perspex lid I made for it) to great effect - very useful for single or small items, but not practical for large loads. It did however start the search for a cooler that would fit the bill, and this one came to the fore pretty quickly.

The Anova sous vide circulator mounts easily in a corner. The lid was relatively easy to cut out and sand to fit the shape so that it could be opened and closed with the equipment in place, and it has plenty of room: at Thanksgiving, this was given over to the vegetable program, so it operated with water at 183 degrees for over 4 hours, cooking vegetables for 14 people (five different gallon bags for most of that time), without a hint of problems.

ISSUES with this solution:
- I will have to seal the cut-out in the lid, as hot moisture accumulates in there during cooking. Not a big deal (a small tea-towel over the gap fixes the problem), but less efficient than perfect.
- There is a hole in the lid! I was looking at making a perspex lid to slip in place, but the ""right"" solution is more expensive than a second cooler...

ADVANTAGES with this solution:
- decent sized water bath that holds temperature effectively
- almost completely eliminated water loss through evaporation
- sturdy handle made moving the whole kit and caboodle a breeze when needed, without fear of hot water spillage
- lit still latches closed

All told, almost perfect for my needs.",Excellent option for Anova sous vide cooking,https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-16-Quart-Excursion-Cooler/product-reviews/B00GZQ80BE/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,T.

I read the instructions and did a test drive and have kept it in my airconditioned bedroom only opening it once in 24 hours to check the ice level since I purchased it. The ice does not last 7-10 days. If you chill it and ice it down for 24 hours and then put all cold items , beverages, in the ice chest, and definitely use the 2:1 ratio, I can get 2-3 days of ice in my air conditioned house. My a.c. window unit is actually right by my ice chest. So in the heat and opening it several times to retrieve beverages I can't imagine the ice would last more than any cooler you could buy at Walmart. I am going to buy the Pelican ICE and try using that and ice to improve results. It's a nice cooler but worth probably $30. Definitely not $200. After reading so many fantastic reviews, I was excited and expected a fabulous product. I don't know what it would cost to ship it back. I am considering it.

I put the ice chest in my garage and it sat there until 9am the following morning when i wrote this review and took the two photos. But as u can see I still have ice and the Rockies are Blue.

All the reviews and research I've done on the web showed these to be better and a cheaper cost then the equivalent sized Yeti. The one I received had manufacture defects, the main hinge had what looked like corrosion that was flaking off into the cooler it's self, the rubber gasket on the lid that makes it air tight had a 3/8 inch gap, also had shipping damage on the outside corners of the cooler. The cooler came loose in a clear platic bag inside of the factory Pelican box. My cooler was sold and shipped by Amazon so I called them and they were prompt to schedule a replacement, sounded good until I looked at my orders and it shows that the replacement isn't expected to ship for another month. I'm not happy with Pelican and very unhappy with Amazon's lengthy replacement in shipping a new one. I will update when the new one is recieved.

Update***
The new Pelican Elite 70 came in two weeks before Amazon's stated ""expected to ship date"" very happy with this. As for the replacement cooler, this one came as how you would expect you find any Pelican products ""without any defects and very sturdy none of the issues that are shown in the pictures. I have not had it long enough to test ice retention only reason for 4 stars, some reviewers had issues with their drain plug so filled it to the top with water closed the lid and let it sit for a few hours.

Each milk jug weighing approximately 4 pounds and I have 3 of them in the cooler. I have to change the jugs every other day and the bottom of the cooler has approximately a quarter of the volume of the bottom of the cooler is water.

Yet it is not another gimmick crap product you typically see for this purpose. I have tried 3 different substitutes for doing this in the past year. All of them were either too bulky, didn't hold enough beer, didn't hold enough ice, or the access zipper was in the top making it a ridiculous task to retrieve a beer. Like many people, I refuse to pay bar prices for 12 OZ cans of beer to a golf course that I just overpaid for a round of golf. So I would cram cold ones into the various compartments of my bag spilling ice all over the place which ends up melting and getting grips wet. Not anymore!! And I can still access all the other pockets for extra balls, tees, etc... Other cooler bags systems I tried that can hold a 6 pack were way too bulky to do that and I actually broke a zipper on my old bag trying to get it closed. I live in Southern California where it gets hot out. Last round I played was in the 90's(temperature) and I drank the 6th beer in the parking lot after the round and it was Ice Cold, so there is plenty of room for enough ice and a 6 pack.

It rolls easily, too. I gave it three stars, though, because of two design flaws. First, the telescoping handle doesn't lock up, so it can collapse in use. Second, while there are molded handles on each side, carrying it that way requires both hands. It needs a swing handle so it can be more easily carried, like up a flight of steps. With the current design, you are left w putting down everything else and just carrying this, or awkwardly carrying it by the long telescoping handle. Or ka-thumping it up the steps.

Just got back from a week long trip to Vegas, which included a couple day trips to the Valley of Fire. These ice packs worked perfectly to keep the bottled water and food cold. I used 3 packs in a 17x10x12 soft cooler with about 20 16.9 FL OZ water bottles and by the end of the day out at Valley of Fire (about 8hrs) in 105-110 degree heat and while the cooler remained in the car while we hiked you could see that some of the bottles of water had also started to freeze a little. Both trips to the Valley of Fire I experienced these same results. On the way back home I visited Nelson's Ghost Town where for 4 hours the cooler sat in a closed up car with outside temps close to 110 degrees and a 15 hour drive home without allowing the food or ice packs inside the cooler thaw. Also by the end of each use 8+ hours the ice packs were still at least 50-75 percent frozen. Note: Average recharge time with my situation was about 24-36 hours.

The seal is unbelievable, good luck trying to open it when changing altitude on a road trip or camping trip you'll have to open drain plug toget rid of the suction.

Still wasn't sure about the size, as I live in a remote area, and do not have an available store to view it in person. When we picked it up from the shipping location, it was large, but fit in the back of my 2014 Jeep Patriot, with the orca facing front towards the door of the hatchback. However, it will not fit in terms of being able to open the cooler while inside, and does take up all of the room in that area, maybe some to spare. So I really wasn't looking to have it in my Jeep but forgot about the occasional transport issue. I'm so glad it fit to get it home and unbox. We have a weather king modular building office, with a front porch area, if you are familiar with that, and are looking to get a cooler. It fits on the front porch with some room to spare to get things in and out, and has two side drains. One on each side, which I was not aware of from what I read or saw online. I did notice that some coolers are now coming out with a hose attachment for drains, which caused me to pause before buying and consider the other cooler company. However, I will seek to modify this somehow to stretch a hose type fitting. To drain. It would be nice to have an on off feature which maybe with tubing I can have some type of pvc style switch. So in terms of advancements in this product line, if the designers were to read this, I would look for that in a future cooler. It has a segment indent inside the cooler where a separator could be placed, but I haven't quite seen that available for this model, and it does not come up in the amazon recommendations, which hey, Amazon, you might want to do for the various sizes, is to link those accessories. For the side net, its odd that its in the back, which makes you want to place the cooler, not up against the wall, but out a little bit, if you want to use that. I would like to be able to alternate it, from back to front, or perhaps smaller ones on the sides too. This model does not seem to have the accessory belt, that the smaller versions has, which I would totally buy. I'm not moving this much, but I might consider the wheel kit, which again does not link by size, to the appropriate wheel kit per model on amazon. All that aside, those are things that are not about the function of the cooler itself. hahaha. But those are thoughts that I have. The cooler itself is very cool LOL. Its holding ice, and I was worried that most of the reviews typically fill the cooler to maximum ice capacity, and we are trying it, with one side ice, and one side storage items. Thus far, I have two and half, ice bags 20 lbs, as I like to chew on ice throughout the day. Its cold, barely any water by day three, and still perfect looking ice and the food seems happier. I do have the basket, which I ordered, and wished it was included. Its pretty good. It does kinda go off track if you are moving it and not paying attention. But its cold, and my food is nice and cool, and I live in super Arizona heat, super sun, with the tan version. The tan color is much more pleasant in person than it looks online. If I got the white, it would likely be red dust colored by the end of the day. But the tan looks good, and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb screaming I'm a cooler. I would like the ability to lock the cooler down without locking the lid, in a stationary place, in addition to the top lid lock, so I can leave the lid open, but the cooler still secure. If I were to say why I chose orca over the other popular model, I would definitely vote for the orca tail handles and logos hahaha. And that the reviews assured me it was top of the line like the other. Only possibly better. I'm satisfied with this cooler and my partner loves it. I will be looking for food storage containers, to separate meats, from drinks at some point, when I have spare time, sipping my ice cold beverages in the hot Arizona midday.",Great Cooler,https://www.amazon.com/Extendable-flex-grip-handles-comfortable-portage/product-reviews/B00GUR1N1W/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Jello,cooler_#N/A_B00GUR1N1W_Jello_782_4008, , ,AM,

Meet the original YETI the Tundra. This was our baby. Where it all started. Where we took our frustrations with cheap coolers and over-engineered the hell out of them. We ended up creating a whole new category of coolers with legendary toughness and famed ice retention. And now we make the rugged, all-purpose Tundra in enough sizes to fit any outdoor adventure. There’s a good bit of its DNA in all the other gear we make too, in the form of patented and envied innovations. We’re proud to see the Tundra has grown up to be the father of all coolers.

You can also sprinkle some rock salt in top and have slushy type drinks. Once your yeti is cold inside the insulation will keep it cold.

Meet the original YETI the Tundra. This was our baby. Where it all started. Where we took our frustrations with cheap coolers and over-engineered the hell out of them. We ended up creating a whole new category of coolers with legendary toughness and famed ice retention. And now we make the rugged, all-purpose Tundra in enough sizes to fit any outdoor adventure. There’s a good bit of its DNA in all the other gear we make too, in the form of patented and envied innovations. We’re proud to see the Tundra has grown up to be the father of all coolers.

NeverFail Hinge System: Two hinge pins and interlocking design prevent the hinge from ever breaking.

T-Rex Lid Latches: Patented design uses heavy-duty rubber so you'll never see another busted latch.

Certified Bear-Resistant FatWall Design: Extra-thick walls hold up to three inches of insulation for unmatched ice retention.

ColdLock Gasket: A freezer-quality gasket circles the length of the lid to block out the heat and lock in the cold.

LipGrip Handles Stay out of the way and make carrying your catch seem less of a chore.

DoubleHaul Handles Made with military-grade polyester rope for extra durability.

Rotomolded Construction: Makes it armored to the core and virtually indestructible.

Vortex Drain System: Leakproof, rugged, and designed for quick and easy draining.

PermaFrost Insulation: Pressure-injected commercial-grade polyurethane foam in the walls and lid makes sure your ice stays ice.

This cooler fits perfectly on my sit-upon fishing kayak. I am not one to prepare freeze dried meals while camping so I needed a cooler that would keep perishable food on ice for up to three days. I packed the cooler with frozen water bottles and filled in the gap's with lose ice.
At the end of three days the remaining frozen water bottles were beginning to thaw and there was still a small bit of loose ice in the cooler. The beverages were cold. I vacuum seal the food in individual meal serving size packets so it won't get waterlogged thus eliminating the need to dump the ice water.

I read the reviews and it did leak some. I changed the o ring and it stopped. It holds ice for several days, and I'm very pleased with my purchase and product for the money.

Last week I was hooking up to my 5th wheel RV and it slipped out of the hitch and all 1200 lbs landed on my cooler. Having this happen in the past the RV fell on my truck bed and caused several thousand dollars in damage. This time my ozark cooler saved my truck and as a result the cooler now has battle scares. I wish I would have taken pics when the trailer was resting on the cooler but my first instinct was to lift it off.  It was crushed in and I thought my cooler was ruined. The caved in lid popped out and still works as if new.  Now I have a reminder to help me make sure the RV is locked in and can't fall out when I use it again. I have not used any other coolers like the Yeti or rtic but would
Highly recommend the Ozark Trails as the best bang for the money.

Topped it off with two packs of ice and for good measure I added in a few of the artic ice sub zero packs.  

Ice solidified into larger blocks after hours on the water.  I got home and out of curiosity just kept the lid closed to see how long the solid ice chunks would stay.  Grabbing just one can a day, the ice blocks stayed solid for about three days and the ice water frigid for four.  The cans were still tolerable after four days which was pretty impressive.

However, it did not last the whole weekend before a screw stripped on the latch.  I exchanged it for a new one in the store but this one had a different gasket design.  The original was one continuous gasket while this new design was not and had a gap.  It leaked when ice was sloshing around, but I was able to take the gasket partially out and reset it so that it did not have a gap anymore.  This fixed the leak but   

However, I noticed the inside of the lid was slightly warped.  I am returning this one as well.  I think they are on the right track but their quality control is a little iffy at times.  The latch also has me worried about longevity with the design they chose.  However, other brands have the same design and they seem to hold up fine so that might be unfounded.  Overall, if you spend the time to really inspect each cooler before you buy it this could be a good deal, but you shouldn't have to be quality control in my opinion.","On The Right Track, Not There Yet",https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-52-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229404,Will,cooler_OZARK_49229404_Will_205_1006, , ,WM,

The cheap plastic ones have their allure and uses, but for a rotomold cooler, I don't think you can go wrong.  It seems to hold ice for a decent amount of time.  See youtube for varied accounts of this cooler's ice keeping capability.  I received mine with a cracked drain plug and I received a replacement two weeks later.  A standard garden hose sized plug works and so does a garden hose connected to divert drainage if that's your fancy.  I believe the Gander Mountain PermaChill Cooler is the same cooler yet it costs significantly more.  The parts for the PermaChill (Latches) will fit the Ozark Trail.  From what I read, the latches are the weak link.  I give this cooler 4 stars because I'm a pragmatic optimistic pessimist (Yea, it's an oxymoron).  I don't think one can go wrong with this cooler.  If you want Yeti performance at twice the money, go buy one.  If you're a weekend warrior and want a little better quality cooler than the myriad of plastic options, this cooler is for you.  It's made in China, but what isn't these days.  Several days of ice keeping from full are definitely possible with this beast.  I say beast because once it's full, it's a heavy load.

Cons- first time out held ice for only 5 days, States it will hold ice for 7 days. Average temp outside was 75 degrees. Some condensation arround the orange section of the plug. No leaks though.
I didn't have a yeti to compare it to but was a little disappointed with ice retention. Over all this is a well built cooler but still a bit over priced for the performance. The true test will be in this summer during the heat. As mentioned in previous reviews, the handles could be a bit longer for one person transport (your fingers tend to smash between the handles and the lid). Overall it's nice, but not a yeti.

pros:
held Ice well
good fit and finish
Not yeti quality but 1/3 the cost and less likely to walk away
Heavy..could be pro or con depending on how you look at it! :-)

cons:
handles need to be longer..loaded it smashes your fingers against the top when one person is loading with the handles.

check to make sure your rubber feet are tight. They are bolted on and mine were loose. Had one come off in the back of my truck. Easy fix.

I don't typically use a cooler for more than a day of fishing but it does seem to hold the ice well.  My first use I put 20lbs of ice in it, the loose nugget kind, and after 3 days there was still some ice and this is in Florida and opening the lid multiple times. The build quality was not perfect, the right latch was not as centered as it could be and I did have some of the most frequent complaints about the drain plug leaking. Mine was extremely slight and I haven't really investigated that yet but it was really minor in my opinion.  Overall, I'm pleased with it.  The Perma Chill brand that Gander Mountain makes is almost identical to this, the only difference I could see is the color and it has 2 places to lock in the corners versus the Ozark had one in the middle and Gander Mountain's is more expensive by about $100 but the replacement latches, handles and plugs that they sell will work with the Ozark.  My opinion:  It's worth it if you need a good cooler for a good price right now (If you can find one).  If you can stand the almost 90 day wait, go with RTIC, they are only a few dollars more than Ozark, still way cheaper than Yeti, Bison, Engle, Pelican etc. and better built.",Probably as good as the more expensive brands,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-52-Quart-High-Performance-Cooler-Grey/49229404,1fishkiller,cooler_OZARK_49229404_1fishkiller_266_1340, , ,WM,

The reason for the disappointment is it won't hold ice. We have used it four or five times going to the lake and the state park. 

We kept it in the house and before we would use it put cold packs in it to get it cold, but the result was the same. Each time it would only hold ice for a little while. 

Also, one day on the boat I noticed the top layer of plastic on the lid was bubbling up.

Was extremely pleased. The size is awesome and it fits in the back of a truck with no problems. Fit the 1/4 beef we needed to transport and kept everything frozen with no issues whatsoever Inside is as roomy as you can get with straight sides. Has a side plug for emptying and a strap on the lid for added support. Lid fits snugly and the color scheme is perfect for outdoor use. I didn't want a white color because they discolor so easily and look horrible after a couple uses. With the dark green bottom on this you won't have to worry about that.

I like that the hinge system has extra support tines on the back. The cup holders on top also fit traditional sized cups and have a bit of a raised edge to give more holding depth. It is also useful as a table or board game holder with space for snacks and drinks on the side. Top has a handy built in tape measure on the top as well that goes up to 36"".

However, if you pack the ice and food into the ice chest correctly (We used paper bags to hold bags of ice as well as loose ice) and limit the time it spends being left open or get everything out and put everything back with limited openings, this ice chest worked great!!! The other issues is, you can't put warm items into an ice chest and expect the ice to last.  A refrigerator removes heat from things, not make cold air; ice chest does the same. It takes the compressor and motor to run in a refrigerator and therefore it must take ""ICE"" to work in an ice chest.

We just finished a recent trip, that this was purchased specifically for. My friends and I shopped on Wed late in the day, packed everything into the chest then hit our camping group the next day. From Thursday to the following Monday, we were away from civilization and come Monday midday, after a long drive from Az to Ca, there was still plenty of ice in this chest. In fact, I actually threw away at least 1.5 full (5lb bags) of ice and items inside were plenty cold. I would highly recommend this and I would say, it does keep the ice good for 5 days, as claimed",Great buy!!

I had seen some video reviews and written reviews of this cooler, and I jumped on purchasing it as soon as I found it available online.   I knew from the reviews that the cooler would leak from the zipper if it were to tip, but I had assumed it was water tight when upright. 

Once I received the cooler, I inspected it and everything looked pretty good. I wanted to be sure it would hold water from melt d ice before I removed the tags, so I filled it 3/4 to the top with water and waited for a while.  Unfortunately, it began seeping water within a short amount of time. It did not pour out water, but enough water was sitting around the base that I will be returning the cooler to my local store. I really wanted to love this cooler, but I think I'm going to spend the extra money to buy the similar model from RTIC. 

Update: I just dumped the water out of the cooler and found a large amount of water trapped between the interior liner and the exterior shell. I'm not sure how one would even go about getting that water out, but I am definitely returning this cooler.",Wanted to love!

There are a few good things about it: 1) It doesn't take up much room, 2) The shoulder strap makes it very easy to transport when wrangling kids, carrying a bunch of fishing equipment, etc. , and 3) We've had no problems with water leaks.

Our problem is that it doesn't keep ice. We've had this cooler for less than 3 months and used it nearly every weekend - we've experimented with different sizes of ice cubes, it's been out in different types of weather, trips with kids, trips without kids (cooler isn't opened as often on these trips), and, no matter what, the ice is completely melted somewhere between 6-8 hours after being put in the cooler. We're on the water longer than that and have no way to restock the ice. We don't have this problem with any of our other coolers. If I still had the receipt we'd return it.

Found this 36 -can HighPerformance Cooler Tote @ Walmart, and decided to purchase as a Valentine's Day gift for the hubby ( I know, I know...it was either that or another electric weed trimmer...)

I usually do not take the time to comment on products, but I feel this one is worth my time. We have just completed our 4th trip using this product, and I am amazed at what we have found out.

First, the bad news, it does not hold 36 cans + ice, but functions like a charm @ 24 cans+ice...or 18 bottles AND A WHOLE LOT OF ICE. ( we like our drinks COLD, and we prefer bottles to cans!) And I would suggest a bit more roomy front pocket.

All the rest I possibly say is good stuff--

     - Bottle openers are an unbelievable addition to a soft cooler
     - Neoprene style shoulder strap makes transport from point A to point B effortless
     - Keeps everything cold, for at least a few days
     - Soft, durable outer lining works perfect in RV and on boat, as we can squeeze it in between other items that would normally rattle when placed together
     - Leak resistant zipper performs very well ( and likely helps cold retention?)
     - When zip-closed, top of cooler was rigid enough to serve as our "" dinner table"" !

In summary, we own a lot of coolers...Igloo, Rubbermaid, Arctic Zone, etc...some hard sided, some soft sided. Not sure who makes "" OzarkTrail"" stuff for WM, but I see the brand used extensively throughout their camping and sporting goods departments, so I can only assume it is a very reliable, reputable supplier .

Just got back from trip out west, and will be heading to WalMart today to see if they have any other similar items to this one!!

Good luck and God Bless America!",Going back to Walmart today ( to buy more),https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-Premium-Jumbo-Tote-Cooler/52620406,KayGirl,cooler_OZARK_52620406_KayGirl_348_1803, , ,WM,

We ordered it and had it shipped to the local store because it wasn't in stock (great service). When we picked up, we were pleasantly surprised by the size and the quality. 

It worked great to keep the breastmilk frozen for over 3 hours with ice packs added!!! Such a lifesaver!!
