You can then put it back into the phone and this time select to use it as external storage. It may want to reformat the SD card again that is fine.

It is pre-loaded with adware that cannot be removed: banner ads as well as full-screen ads. A factory reset revealed that the adware was indeed pre-installed (before the reset, I had only installed two extremely reputable apps, so I was certainly not the source of the adware).

Some Googling showed that others have had the same experience with the same pre-installed adware. One Amazon review from three months ago referencing the adware even has a response from BLU: acting as if they didn't know the adware -- that took me less than 10 minutes to track down -- came installed on phones they themselves sell. Absolutely disgusting.

I have gone ahead and changed all passwords for all accounts accessed through this phone: if there's adware, spyware is not an unrealistic concern. Indeed an internet search shows this is a very real worry -- I have not investigated for myself, but better safe than sorry. If you want peace of mind after buying this phone, that's what you're going to have to do. Not a very positive aspect of the purchasing experience.

Unfortunately, some people will buy this phone (for around 50 dollars) and expect to somehow get a Galaxy S8, and frankly those folks are going to be disappointed. HOWEVER, for what it is supposed to be, it’s great. This is most definitely a product for a specific kind of cell phone user. If you happen to that kind of user, you will really like it.
It comes with a somewhat “conservative” quad core processor, so don’t expect miracles with respect to processing power, but most games and limited multi-tasking will be OK. The 8 GB of built-in storage is decidedly on the lightweight side, and that actually only gives you about 4 GB for your own stuff out of the box, but the ability to add an SD Card and have Android “adopt” it to be internal storage makes up for that. It accepted an additional 32 GB for me with no complaints. Storage problems solved.
An earlier version of this device sort of, maybe, kind of, perhaps barely had enough RAM to run Android Lollipop, and it would on occasion limp along noticeably while it did. The Virtue Pro comes with 1 GB of RAM, which is more than enough to do a very acceptable job of running its fairly lean Android Marshmallow build, along with a concurrent app or two, even if it may not set the world on fire while doing so.
Dual SIM capability almost seems like gilding the lily on a device like this, but it is in there. Actually, it is difficult to find ANY cell phone these days that doesn’t support dual SIMs. Bluetooth works rather well, but USB OTG and screen casting are not going to be found. Battery life is OK, although maybe not spectacular. If you are going to be talking non-stop all day long and expect that to happen on a single charge, this may not be the phone for you. It does charge quickly enough that you could top it off without too much trouble. It is NOT 4G LTE, but it DOES support the lower end of 4G speeds with HSPA+ (think 3G on steroids). If you’re going to use it with Netflix or any other streaming service, perhaps better to do it over a Wi-Fi connection, although I was pleasantly surprised at how well HSPA+ can actually do in a pinch.
The tiny screen has decent resolution and good picture quality as long as you aren’t expecting full HD. The tiny control buttons could be a bother if, like me, you have LARGE hands. The screen also seems to be a really effective fingerprint dirt and smudge magnet, so it might require more frequent cleaning. The camera functionality is good for casual photos and selfies if you are so inclined. Sound quality on voice calls is decent as well. It doesn’t have every feature under the sun, but the features it does have work the way they should.
It fits in your pocket with room to spare. The shell is made of some high impact plastic, which makes it incredibly light, and makes the TPU case most phones come with these days pretty much irrelevant. People who say it almost feels like a toy in their hands are quite correct. It comes with a (flexible plastic variety) screen protector pre-installed, although I would like to see tempered glass as an option since I prefer the tactile sensation of real glass on a touch screen. Everything you need is in the box. Just add a SIM Card (and an SD Card for extra storage) and you’re good to go.
It is a good music device for a long run, bike ride, or a trip to the gym. It’s amazingly light, and mine pairs flawlessly with my Bluetooth headset. It would be PERFECT to give to younger children for their first phone, not only because they have smaller hands, but because, well, things happen with kids and cell phones. Aside from losing them with regularity, kids sometimes accidentally manage to feed their first cell phone to their dog, or drop it in a swimming pool. I have personally known these things (and more) to happen. It’s probably better if it happens with a 50 dollar phone rather than a 500 dollar phone.
Heck, you could just keep one of these as a spare in case your uber-priced flagship phone decides to catch fire one day and you need a phone while waiting for the replacement. The Virtue Pro is a good phone, it is reasonably priced, and at the possible risk of contradicting the cell phone purists, it is a FUN kind of device.","Nice phone, nice price.",https://www.amazon.com/Figo-Virtue-PRO-4-0-Smartphone/product-reviews/B01NAII7JB/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,George Nezlek,smartphone_#N/A_B01NAII7JB_George Nezlek_792_4341, , ,AM,

I thought I got a defective phone as it wouldn't turn on even after plugging it in. How silly of me not to even think about that! Took me a good minute to figure out. :)

WHAT'S IN THE BOX:
Phone, Charging cable and adapter, pre-installed screen protector (which is a plus!), an extra glass protector, phone case, and a phone ring/holder.

WHAT I LIKE:

PRICE:
I can't believe that I've only paid just a little over $100 for this awesome phone. It really is the best bang for your buck!

SCREEN:
The screen is big, bright and very responsive. Typing is easy and quick. Plus, the screen size is great for watching videos.

SPEED:
It has a 1.3Gz Quad Core and 2G of RAM. Yes, there are other phones much powerful than this but always consider the price point! Also, it has been able to keep with all of the stuff that I wanted it to do. Even after installing a few applications, it still runs fast. The big thing is that there isn't a lot of bloatware added! I hate those pre-installed apps I never use. So that is a huge plus! Also, it has an expandable memory up to 128G.

BATTERY:
It came with a large battery at 4500mAh. It sure does holds a charge. And it doesn't get too hot after prolonged use. I usually use my phone watching videos. That is why I am so glad that I don't have to constantly charge this phone.

CAMERA:
Takes decent photos. Especially when taking pictures in HDR. Outcome is also nice in low light. Front is 5 Megapixel and Rear is 13 MP. Auto-focus is also great and on point. It's also equipped with a flash on both the rear and front camera.

SIGNAL:
Mine works great! Call and text messaging works fine. You just got to check which service provider works best for you!

LOOK:
It looks very simple but what I love about it is the face of the screen. It doesn't distracts me while I am using it since it's black. But I feel like I should've gotten the gold one, it looks more chic. Also, the back of the phone has a matte finish. It feels very comfortable and smooth while in use.

These might be some points you might consider as cons (Not to me but I'll just throw it out there):

1. No earphones included. Not a deal breaker since I've had several name-brand phones that didn't come with earphones. Plus, I already own quite a few.
2. It is a tad heavy but it doesn't bother me any because I know it's the battery that is adding weight to it. And I love that it holds a charge. Don't worry, it is not too heavy that it gets too uncomfortable. You'll get used to it eventually. :)
3. It is not 4G. There are WI-fi everywhere so I don't really care. I got internet at work and at home and as long as I get messages and calls, then I am good.

Most name-brand phones with similar specs are quite expensive especially if you get the ones that are already unlocked. That is why I opted to buy this one. For a little over $100, I didn't expect much out of it. I am sorry for the lengthy review. It's just that his phone is awesome. I am beyooooond pleased!",The only thing CHEAP about this phone is the price.,https://www.amazon.com/CUBOT-Unlocked-Smartphone-Notification-OFFICIAL/product-reviews/B072DTHQD4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,K.

With a huge IPS screen (6”) and strong battery(4500 mAh) it is real 2 in 1 device. It easy replaces your mini tablet and allows you to utilize all phone functions. For me ( and probably for many others) it is very convenient to have it during the travel. I got it week ago , was very exited and started to check its fixtures immediately. This is what I have found:
1. The screen is real huge but still convenient to operate.
2. The screen images are clear and bright enough even for sunny day.
3. Pretty poor for nowadays 1.3 GHz CPU works very fast probably because of a new fast operating system 7.0.
4. The battery serves this huge consumer very well and lasts about 2 days. BTW, it’s removable and makes sense to have a second one to use as a spare.
5. If you think 16 GB ROM is not enough for you, just put an extension memory card to the slot(I did not try it yet).
6. The rear and front cameras are not perfect but work like an average ones.

I have to add that this amazing phone arrived in a well looking white box together with wall charger, clear durable phone case and screen protector.",Recommend for travelers as a 2 in 1 device,https://www.amazon.com/CUBOT-Unlocked-Smartphone-Notification-OFFICIAL/product-reviews/B072DTHQD4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,ilyad,smartphone_#N/A_B072DTHQD4_ilyad_215_1159, , ,AM,

The camera doesn't quite compare to the big players, but this phone has a huge battery, works FAST, gets good wifi and cell reception, runs the latest version of android, is huge, supports two sim cards (and a removable battery), and looks good too.
One note-- when I got the phone I thought I had to send it back for a replacement because it didn't turn on and didn't seem to charge... but I figured it out! Open up the back and you'll see a little piece of blue plastic to pull from the battery! This allows the battery to make the connection to the phone and will get the phone working right away.

So I decided to go to Android unlocked phone then I see this Amazing huge phone.

7) Bluetooth connectivity to my headphones and car is working fine without any problem

He wanted a simple phone to take pictures of his grandchildren, and do not care about texting or internet speeds. Since he will be using the phone exclusively on wi-fi, having a 3G limitation does not matter to him.

Right out of the package I was pleasantly surprised that the phone comes with a pre-installed screen protector and clear TPU phone case similar to a Rinke fusion. When installing screen protectors I always have problems with dust specks, air bubbles, and alignment, so a professionally pre-installed one is always welcomed! The phone also includes a spare glass screen protector as well. Spec-wise, this phone is a tank and is equipped with everything that a modern smartphone should have. It has your 2gb ram, quad-core processor, large screen, amazing battery life, removable battery, Android N, dual SIM, 13MP rear.5MP front camera, the list goes on!

This phone is HUGE; it’s roughly the same size as my Nexus 6. He’s been using it to take pictures and videos all day and there’s still plenty of battery life left. I love that the phone can hold two different SIM cards at once, so he does not need to worry about swapping cards when he travels back to his home country. Although the phone only comes in a 16GB configuration, I am happy that it has the option of expandable storage; not many phones provide that option anymore. All of these features are definitely a plus for a geek like me, but my dad’s favorite feature will definitely be the cameras. He complains that his old phone takes blurry/grainy photos, and there’s no front camera for selfies with the grandchildren. I can already imagine his reaction. He will be super excited about the back and front cameras, but will be BLOWN AWAY with the front camera flash!

Overall this is a great phone packed with great features at an excellent price point. The only setback, which is a personal preference, is that my dad might not like such a big phone. But once he realizes that big screen = better for pictures, I’m sure he will learn to adapt. My next task would be to look for a phone case for this phone.",Budget phone with amazing specs,https://www.amazon.com/CUBOT-Unlocked-Smartphone-Notification-OFFICIAL/product-reviews/B072DTHQD4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,DS,smartphone_#N/A_B072DTHQD4_DS_390_2211, , ,AM,

I am not saying this was a bad product. I am actually currently using it at the moment to write this review. I have had the phone for at least 3 months now and I have had minimal issues from the phone. Sometimes the battery will die at about 30%. Snapchat, Instagram and Games aren't very great for the battery life. When I got the phone it had some cosmetic issues. One speaker didn't work. Yeah, it may have been a little less than what I was expecting, but it was an amazing price! I would refer this product again. Although, if you're expecting a lot for a little bit of money, you might want to keep shopping.

This phone does not have the apps menu available as other android v.7 phones do.

One of the main purposes I purchased this phone was the dual sim card capability and its ability to Incorporate an SD card. I was disappointed that you could not use two sim cards and an SD card at the same time.

I love this phone!!! Every day I like it better!
Upgrading my stars from 4 to 5

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Ordered one for myself and one for my wife. She has an Honor 5X and loves it, so I thought I'd give this a try for myself. Wife uses hers for constant conversations and facebook/youtube. I use mine only for phone/text and to play music from my SD cards, played into my Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones. Both phones work very well indeed for our needs.

Though the 6X does drain its battery faster than my old phone (5000 ma/h battery) it is still better than phones I've had previously and it doesn't really affect me since I can charge from anywhere using my battery pack. What IS noticeable, however, is the SPEED of this phone compared to ANY I've had before, the fast octacore CPU and the 3gb RAM do their job very nicely. It does not stall, freeze, hesitate in any way for me. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone instantly... so fast, in fact that I tried opening it with every fingerprint I have, just to see if they're faking it. Nope, it's for real.

HOWEVER, my phone had difficulties in setting up. The wife's did not. Then suddenly they decided to update to a better EMUI (the user interface that is Android but looks like an iPhone)... and all of the difficulties ended.

We are happy with the phones, but it would have saved me several hours if the full updated EMUI was originally installed.",EMUI update solved initial issues,https://www.amazon.com/Honor-6X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Gold/product-reviews/B01MT13NNB/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Scott Condor,smartphone_#N/A_B01MT13NNB_Scott Condor_254_1429, , ,AM,

I wish I knew about this phone before I bought my LG-G4 a couple of years ago for which I paid way much more than the Honor 6X and died on me less than a year down the road due to system update causing me to lose a lot of my data which was stored in the phone. The LG-G4 was insured (for an extra $10 / month in my contract) so it was replaced with a refurbished model of the same. Guess what! A couple of months down the road the refurbished LG-G4 died on me again!!! the LG company played dumb. I had no idea that this phone was out there, I didn't even know what an ""unlocked phone"" until a trusted friend talked to me about the Honor 6X and highly recommended it. Solely upon my trusted friend's recommendations when time came to choose another phone from my carrier or buy mine, I chose the later option and bought my H. 6X. Let me tell you: This was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I use it almost 5 months now with no issues whatsoever. The battery is excellent, lasts me almost twice as much than my previous high end / more expensive LG model for same / compatible type of usage. Downloads and updates seem to happen in half speed, blue tooth radius extends twice as far, as well as wi-fi receptivity. Just to offer you an example: with my previous more expensive LG-G4 phone when I went one room away - in any direction - from the location where my wi-fi router is located the signal was dropped / lost. With my Honor 6X I connect to my wi-fi in my car, in my driveway (!) which was an impossibility with my previous supposingly better brand name phone! The camera of the Honor 6X on paper is of a lesser quality that the camera of my ex- LG phone, yet I haven't really noticed any difference in the quality / clarity / resolution of the pictures the 6X takes. Most excellent pictures!

- Size and appearance are OK when in exercise clothes. It would look ridiculous in business attire.
- Setup was a bit frustrating. Prying the back off required damaging the plastic a bit, as it's very tightly attached. You need to wedge something into the single small gap and pop the back off. I met resistance, so I slid a nail file along the small gap rather than twisting further. roughening the plastic a bit. When you open it, I recommend holding the bands back a bit, as they provide some downward pressure on the back cover in their natural position.
- The battery pops out easily once the back cover is off, and there's a memory slot and one for a sim (medium size slot; if you have a micro it will need a medium frame around it).
- The watch is a GSM watch, which pretty much limits you to T-Mobile and associated piggyback networks that run on T-Mobile. Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and networks that run off AT&T will NOT work (AT&T ended GSM support on Jan 1, 2017). I used a card from a company called MintSim, which allows you to buy unlimited talk / text in advance.
- The watch could not find the T-Mobile network at first. Popping the activated sim into an unlocked T-Mobile phone and then back into the watch seemed to fix this, although it could have been a coincidence. After restarting the watch a few times, I think it just takes 2-3 minutes to find the network. Once it locks in, it seems to keep the signal.
- It worked just like the shoe from Get Smart: talk into the watch, noise comes from the watch. Volume and clarity were good. It is bluetooth-capable, but I did not test this.
- Entering a contact was a nightmare, as it uses old SMS-style text entry (press twice on 2 to get the letter ""B"", etc) and the screen is so small. I gave up.
- Texting would similarly be a nightmare.

In addition to making a good exercise phone, this would be great to give to young kids to have at school; it would make them reachable, and allow for emergency phone calls without tempting them to text or get into the addiction of a smart phone.",Review as a Standalone Phone,https://www.amazon.com/Pandaoo-Universal-Bluetooth-Stopwatch-Smartphones/product-reviews/B01FVR9CB4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Gambol,smartphone_#N/A_B01FVR9CB4_Gambol_407_2209, , ,AM,

I will property rate it then. But i ordered this watch on sunday night. It arrived in the afternoon on Tuesday! Very fast shipping. Boxing was as expected(no issues) watch was in grear condition no scratches band perfectly held together. charged it for about 2 hours. Has lasted 6 hours now and still shows a full battery so my phone has actaully died loooong before the watch. I did not put my sims card in yet due to needing to use my gps on phone. However i have connected it to BT. I had a few issues getting it connected for nodifications at first. Finally found an app that worked(so go threw playstore if needed until you find one that works. type BTnotifications and the one that worked for me was called BT smartwatch) youll know when its equipt because your start to recieve messages. First phone call was rocky due to never doing so before. Sounds a bit quite but to be expected. Texting is complex due to the style of keyboard but i really see no reason to complain. It works...recieves and sends messages in a fast manor as should. Camra is not a useable feature on mine. It works and all but quality is like an older tablet. Works but has static. All and all id say for the price you cannot beat it. Great first smart watch. Deffinatly worth the money for first timers atleast. If you are wanting one id recommend this one to friends. No complaints thus far.,A real review,https://www.amazon.com/Pandaoo-Universal-Bluetooth-Stopwatch-Smartphones/product-reviews/B01FVR9CB4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Amazon Customer,smartphone_#N/A_B01FVR9CB4_Amazon Customer_266_1436, , ,AM,

This device Rocks My World! I’ve been a loyal Blackberry User since the beginning (RIM days) and my favorite device was always the Pearl. This device reminds me A LOT of the Pearl. I was supposed to receive my KEYone (Verizon) in mid-July but I got lucky and Amazon said they received a batch and I would have mine sooner, and I did! Switching from my POS (don’t even get me started) PRIV to the KEYone was a cinch! My Verizon online Account recognizes it by its’ Model Name and doesn’t provide a picture, hilarious. But it works! The latest Android OS is mature, smooth, (so far), and free of bugs.

What I love about my new KEYone:
- That I don't have to slide my keyboard out to type!!!
- The latest Android OS is very good. After 3 days of heavy use, app’s have not crashed, nor has the device stalled while multitasking (copying and pasting data between apps, etc).
- Screen is very responsive. Touchscreen is Awesome!
- Device is narrower than the PRIV and it fits perfectly in between my Right thumb and my pinky and I got decent size hands! I loved the Pearl because it was narrow and really small. KEYone is approximately the same length as the PRIV and rock solid, Corporate. Yeah!
- There is one bay for the SIM and microSD cards. Clean and simple!
- It is a Beautiful Device. Perfect match up of materials.
- The antenna rocks! PRIV users will know what I’m talking about. The PRIV had antenna problems. I now get 4G and all bars everywhere that I didn’t get with the PRIV.
- USB Type-C charging port. This is much more heavy duty than the previous device's Micro USB charging ports.
- I use LastPass and I love that NOW LastPass will auto-fill every app that I use. Finally! Makes life easier. I know this was an Android OS issue, previously. Please don’t release an update that breaks this functionality!
- My device doesn’t have any carrier bloatware installed. I love a clean device.

One odd observation that I made is when I type on the keyboard the keys make a noticeable “clicking” sound. Maybe it’s just new and I need to write a few Novels (Lordy I’m good at that!). But this wasn’t the case with the previous devices. Keyboards were quiet...Something to think about here TCL...

I’m not seeing the Convenience key issues that others have noted. This phone hangs out in in my rear pocket, it moves around, and I haven’t observed the camera engaging.

This is an Excellent comeback phone, nice job!

My Keyone does not recognize my 128gb exfat SD card, which I want to use as ‘portable storage’. I have downloaded and apparently installed the “Microsoft exfat for Blackberry” app. I suspect the Keyone does not see that the app is installed. The 128gb exfat SD card is loaded with data and works perfectly in my BB Classic and in my Windows 7 PC. The “Content Transfer” app wants to reformat the card, but states that the card will “then no longer work on any other device”, which sounds like nonsense and would be useless.

I happen to like it a lot. I happen to like it more than the other phones I've used over the past few years which includes both iPhones and Androids. If I were to only grade it based on the positives I'd give it 5 stars easily. But it has some big negatives that bring it down.

Before I explain why I'm giving this admittedly great phone 3 stars I want to give a brief background. I have used the KEYone on the AT&T network for at least three weeks now. I've put it through the paces: texting, phone calls, emails, watching videos, using common 3rd party apps like Waze and lesser used ones like Socketscan which includes a laser scanner connected via bluetooth. I've used this phone for both personal and business purposes. I used Blackberry phones for years and years, but had to walk away after my disastrous experience with the Torch. I was tired of the Blackberry not working with 3rd party apps and offering such a horrible internet experience. After the Torch I used multiple iPhones and Androids.

With that out of the way, the KEYone positives and negatives:

Positives
1. The obvious first choice - the keyboard! All the people who've written articles about those of us who want a keyboard are just nostalgic, not tech savvy or just stupid can go suck an egg. I'm a typist. I can type 100 words a minute on a computer. Virtual keyboards just suck. I cannot type fast without feeling the keys. I've wasted so much time with all my previous phones. Now, back to Nirvana. I can finally type a message to someone and not make mistakes.

2. Almost as great as the keyboard - the battery! In the last five years I've yet to use any smartphone that's performed as well as the KEYone in terms of battery life. I can read web sites for two hours, run Waze while I'm driving for a few hours, then run Asellertool with the phone connected to a bluetooth laser scanner, then use Waze again for a few hours and STILL have at least 30% of the battery left. On my last Android I would have had to charge at least twice during that time. The iPhone wouldn't have performed much better. Simply put, the KEYone battery kicks butt.

3. For anyone who used the Blackberry at one time and had to leave the platform, but missed Blackberry functionality . . . welcome home. The Blackberry just helps you get things done. It helps you be organized. Blackberries were always the best phones for people who used them for work. The KEYone, for the most part, is a return to this world.

4. I love Apple computers, but I've resented the fact that the iPhones had such limited built in memory and you had to pay a huge price to get more. You can expand the KEYone with a memory card. Love it.

Neutrals
1. Photos and videos are acceptable. You'll get better shots with an iPhone 6s or higher. C'est la vie.

Now, here's why I have to knock off stars . . .

1. The antenna on the KEYone is not powerful. In fact, when I'm in a crunch it borders on being completely unacceptable. There are times when I'm using Waze and I need the app to tell me where I am and how to get to my next business stop. I need it immediately. The KEYone has repeatedly failed in these situations where other phones have not.

2. The cell signal bar tells you have a signal, but the phone won't function. I've seen the phone have 2 bars and I cannot get Waze to work or access a web page. This has happened multiple times. The signal bar is infuriating.

3. The phone doesn't play nice with some 3rd party apps. I took me several days to get the KEYone to work with my Socket scanner and asellertool app. This scanner and app can work almost immediately on any Android released in the last two years and any iPhone 5 or above. Not on the KEYone. I had to really work to make it function. Making matters worse, the people at Blackberry when I contacted them about the problem basically shrugged and told me it was the fault of the 3rd party app. It wasn't. It was the phone. It works fine now, but it was not an easy process. Your mileage may vary if you depend on 3rd party apps to work with your phone.

4. The KEYone lacks the clean interface and stability of the iPhone. And I say that as someone who doesn't want to own an iPhone. I've seen situations where the phone pauses or glitches for no apparent reason at all. And yes, I have updated the OS. Admittedly this is something that can improve over time. I want to emphasize that this isn't a major problem. For most people this might not even matter. I mention it mostly for two reasons. One, if I'm paying $500+ for a phone I want it to be already tested and rock solid in performance. Two, if someone is coming from using the iPhone they might be surprised that the phone doesn't work perfectly all the time. I don't consider this problem a deal breaker, but more of a minor annoyance.

I want to stress again that I really like the KEYone. There's no other phone on the market in mid-2017 that I want. The plusses outweigh the negatives for me with the KEYone. The keyboard and battery alone are super huge plusses. But that doesn't mean I'm not peeved with Blackberry and TCL (the maker of the phone) for not knocking this one out of the ballpark. The mistakes made here were preventable and knowable before release. So I'm giving the 3 stars because, quite honestly, they need to do better next time. I'll keep coming back, I'll buy the next Blackberry when this one eventually fails or I need something more powerful. But the next one needs to not have these issues, especially the weak antenna.","This is a great phone, there's no other phone on the market I want, but it still has issues",https://www.amazon.com/BlackBerry-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-T-Mobile/product-reviews/B06ZYGDY4P/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,FotoPat,smartphone_#N/A_B06ZYGDY4P_FotoPat_1020_5550, , ,AM,

I think was the Bold or the Curve. Then along came the iPhone, and I, like most people, jumped on the iPhone bandwagon and rode it for a few years. One day I was shopping at Amazon and discovered that BlackBerry was still in business selling phones! I bought the Q10 and was so happy to return to a physical keyboard. I then upgraded to the PassPort (Silver Edition), which was at that time the best mobile phone for adults with the best keyboard ever. Sadly the PassPort was running BB10, BlacBerry's amazing OS, superior in every way to iOS and Android, in my opinion, but because of a lack of apps it became unusable for me. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, BlackBerry introduced the PRIV, their first Android BlackBerry phone. It comes with a slide out keyboard which I personally didn't care too much for, but overall the PRIV was (and remains) a terrific phone running a solid version of Android.

After producing a couple of nifty Android phones (the DTEK series) without a physical keyboard, BlackBerry introduced the KEYone designed by BlackBerry but made by TCL. It runs the latest version of Android, has an amazing keyboard, and comes with two terrific cameras - a real surprise. The KEYone is fast and efficient and in spite of the odd sized screen, movies and games look just fine on it. It is an all metal phone, not a glass slab like most phones out there. It comes with the Google Play Store so there is no shortage of apps. The battery life is absolutely astounding. I'm a heavy user - streaming music and talk radio literally all day in my office, writing a lot of emails and text messages, and I easily get a day's use out of it without having to plug it in. It comes with a quick charge option, and believe me, it is quick! Oh, and if you feel the need to type on a virtual keyboard, you can turn it on! The KEYone comes with the BlackBerry virtual keyboard, which can be turned on or off in the settings. The BlackBerry designers have thought of everything.

Should you buy this phone? YES! If you are a heavy texter, the physical keyboard slows you down just enough - but not too much - so you make far fewer typos. If you want to upgrade to a phone running the latest version of Android but without the bloat the comes with most mobile phones, the KEYone might be for you. It's close to a stock Android phone. If you want the most secure mobile phone on the market, the KEYone is for you. It has plenty of on-board storage and is expandable up to 2TB via a micro SD card.

The phone is a bit heavier than I had expected, but it’s not a negative for me. The phone feels quite substantial in the hand. I like the balance of the phone more than my previous Android phone (a Nexus 5X). If you’re coming from another large phone, like a iPhone plus or a Galaxy Note sized phone, you’ll find yourself right at home with the KeyOne. Overall, this phone has surpassed my expectations, and I’m quite satisfied. It seems to have been worth the wait.

-- Software --

Blackberry Launcher / Home Screen:
I’m really impressed with the thought put into the Blackberry Launcher. I personally prefer to have badges on my icons, so that is a nice feature compared to the stock Android experience. I believe you can turn the badges off if you prefer the icons to always be clean.

Blackberry Hub:
I’m a big fan of the Blackberry Hub application. It’s basically a combination of an email application with a messaging notification center. I like the concept, and the execution seems to be pretty good as well. It’s nice to have all my text based communication in one place so that I can follow conversations across different applications. Emails are slightly delayed compared with other “push” email clients. This is a delay of like 30 seconds, so it shouldn’t matter much, but you’ll definitely gets emails with other clients first.

Life without a virtual keyboard:
A big pet peeve of mine when using all touchscreen smartphones is the fact that the display changes between when you’re viewing content and when you’re interacting with the content. I was frequently annoyed when the content would shift up due to the introduction of a virtual keyboard onto the screen. That’s not (as much) of a problem when a physical keyboard is present like with the KeyOne. The autocorrect suggestions do take up a small about of space at the bottom of the screen, but it’s not as noticeable of a change. Over the last two weeks I’ve enjoyed this aspect of having a physical keyboard the most.

-- Hardware --
The physical keyboard is much as I remember it back from my days using a Blackberry Bold 9700. This keyboard isn’t curved like the old bold style, but I haven’t found a need for the curve. My typing accuracy matched a virtual keyboard by the time I finished entering all my accounts and logging into all my apps after setting up the phone. I’ve definitely found typing anything complex, like a password with special characters, to be much easier with the physical keyboard. I also absolutely love that there is essentially a 10 key built into the keyboard. Just double press one of the alt keys and you can go to town on some spreadsheets or other calculations.

I find the feature of using the keyboard as a scroll pad to be pretty hit or miss. It definitely needs to be fine tuned in future updates, as it currently suffers from a lot of horizontal scrolling when attempting to vertically scroll. I have used a mixture of scrolling with the keyboard and just moving my hand farther up the screen and scrolling on the screen.

It’s wonderful to have so many more buttons for shortcuts on the phone. This has allowed me to keep my most used applications off the main screen of the phone, since I can always launch those with the keyboard. So much time saved scrolling on the homescreen looking for where I placed an app icon.

The hand feel of the phone is wonderful. I appreciate the grippy rubber back of the phone. It feels secure when placed on a table or in a pocket. I’ve have problems with metal or plastic backed phones sliding off a ledge or out of a pocket. The phone definitely feels like a premium phone in the hand.

One of my biggest concerns before buying this phone was that the screen wouldn’t be color accurate or bright enough. I’ve found the screen on this phone to look wonderful and be quite accurate and to my tastes as far as a color temperature goes. I’m not sure where my perception of a low quality screen came from. I suppose it was most often compared to AMOLED screens, and that their color vibrancy (but inaccuracy) made the screen appear to be low quality in comparison. The screen can get quite bright for outdoor visibility when you have auto brightness on. I’ve certainly had no problems using the phone outdoors. If you don’t leave the automatic brightness adjustment on, then it might not get bright enough for your tastes, but I like automatic brightness adjustments, so I have access to the higher maximum brightness.

Wireless reception does seem to be an issue for this phone. In comparison to my Nexus 5X I get about half the distance / number of walls passed through in regards to Bluetooth. The displayed reception is often 1 or 2 bars at my house, and 3 bars at the office. Phone call quality seems good on the few phone calls I’ve had. LTE performance is about 8 mbps at the office and between 8 and 14 mbps home. That's perfectly acceptable to me, and I don't really have a good reference point from my previous phones. I don't remember getting much higher than 20 mbps at my home in the past.

-- Battery Life --
This phone does indeed have great battery life. After my first day (24 hours) of normal phone usage I had 56% of my battery life remaining. This includes some chromecasting of media, some streaming music to bluetooth headphones, a fair amount of screen time reading articles, and some messaging in both messaging apps and SMS. After a day like that my Nexus 5X would be totally out of battery and require a recharge. The KeyOne seems to have about double the battery life of a Nexus 5X.

My second day I decided not to charge my KeyOne at the end of the day. Including a software update applied approximately 30 hours without charging my phone reported a remaining battery percentage of 26% after 48 hours.

After two weeks of testing, I’m consistently using around 40% of my mattery per 24 hours period. This usage is the same as my Nexus 5X which would require a charge every night, so I’ve been able to completely forget about battery anxiety or concerns about using the phone too much if I was going to be heading out in the evening after work.

-- Final Thoughts --
The KeyOne is a substantial upgrade in terms of build quality compared to a phone like the Nexus 5X. Battery life in the KeyOne is fantastic, and the physical keyboard opens up a lot of productivity opportunities like shortcuts and scrolling. I’m very happy with my KeyOne’s performance, but I don’t play any games on my smartphones and if you do want to play demanding games you’d be better off buying a phone with a stronger GPU. If you’re comfortable using a physical keyboard and battery life and productivity are your two main concerns with a smartphone, I think the KeyOne is hands down the best option on the market.",Productivity and Quality: A Key Combination,https://www.amazon.com/BlackBerry-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-T-Mobile/product-reviews/B06ZYGDY4P/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,HVR,smartphone_#N/A_B06ZYGDY4P_HVR_1199_6798, , ,AM,

This Blackberry runs on Android so there are some annoying things like the multiple advertisements within app's and the annoying way google tries to connect everything Google related to the Android system.

I transitioned to the KeyOne from and iPhone, with this being my first Android OS phone, and I'm really pleased with it so far. I ordered mine on the day it was released and have been using it for a few weeks now.

CDMA version: if you're worried at any point about whether this will work with Verizon, it does. I activated mine at a Verizon store where the employees all expressed doubt, including the manager telling me that this phone would ""never work with Verizon."" When they insert the SIM and start the activation, there may be some error messages, which it turns out, only appear because their system isn't very acquainted with this phone. The texting does work normally (sending as SMS) and not by using data, as the Verizon system suggested.

Pros:
Having a physical keyboard is really nice to feel again. It reminds me of the pre-iPhone days when people had a variety of cool phones.
The battery is excellent! Even when streaming videos on data, the battery doesn't drain.
The camera has cool features, such as full abilities to adjust the capture settings, like on a DSLR, and takes great pics in low light.
The phone size is very comfortable in your hand.
Security options, and the DTEK security on this phone are fantastic.
The spacebar fingerprint reader works better than any other surface scanner I've used before.
The option to expand the memory with a micro SD is a nice feature which I'm happy to have after switching from Apple.
BlackBerry Hub is a great feature which organizes all notifications in a timeline, so you can have a visual memory of information you may have received (which is pretty important to some people).

Cons:
The rounded edges on the side of the screen means that a screen protector can't fully cover all of the glass.
If you use the BlackBerry Flip Case, using a screen protector in combination will weaken the strength of the magnet connections, which works the screen awakening function.
Magnetic car mounts (like the SCOSCHE mounts which use a plate) also interfere with the magnetic sensors in the phone slightly (depends on positioning).
While the screen is plenty large enough, I've found that many apps (Instagram, Snap Chat, etc...) are sized for iPhone dimension screens, and a bit may not be visible without scrolling.

Basically, this phone does exactly what BlackBerry said it would, is reliable, and has plenty of tools to keep you optimally organized. Purchasing this phone outright, as opposed to the 'lease-to-buy' plans that the major carriers love to have customers do, is a good chunk of change for a phone; especially after the accessories (extra charging cables, screen protector, case, car mount, micro SD etc...). Still, it's less than the overall ownership of many iPhone models. The KeyOne's inclusion of a key on the keyboard, with the primary function as a ""$"" symbol, implies that the owner really isn't worried about the cost of the device. This phone however, stands out from the generic iPhone or other Android devices. While the KeyOne isn't a Vertu, it still has the vibe of something that still might satisfy James Bond.",You know you want it...,https://www.amazon.com/BlackBerry-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-T-Mobile/product-reviews/B06ZYGDY4P/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2,Amazon Customer,smartphone_#N/A_B06ZYGDY4P_Amazon Customer_521_3131, , ,AM,

After those couple weeks however my screen malfunctioned creating what looked like a purple blotch on the lower corner of my screen. Within an hour my whole screen was covered and I was unable to further use my phone. I have no damaged the screen in any way there was no water damage and had a screen protector. Upon contacting Samsung directly they stated that this a malfunction of the phone not consumer related - therefore it was not a new phone. Upon contacting the company for a replacement phone they were unable to help me in anyway because of a one month policy.

Personal Review:
The Pantech Burst... I've had this phone ever since I was a junior in High School. That was roughly three and a half years ago. And for being able to last me that long, that earns it a star. The other star is for being able to provide you with all the basic functions of a smartphone. It's a very bare-bones phone; you cannot play most (if not any) medium-heavy games: which is the primary reason why I never got into games on the Google Playstore.
The screen resolution is 480p and the pictures that your camera takes are (completely) atrocious. Don't even bother cropping your taken photos, the image's quality will drop even more.
I can't imagine anyone in their right mind who would want to purchase this phone. Seriously, you can find a modern simplistic phone for around $150. This phone doesn't even have Android 4.4 KitKat.
If you need a little guidance, I'll refer you to something like the Moto G (2nd & 3rd gen)... A budget phone that will last you with all the essentials of a smartphone and then some... The Pantech Burst was a cheap phone back in the day, and without a doubt, the cheap phones today are better and improved.

I never thought the day would come... No actually, I knew that the day would come... when I would lose ALL of my data because of the death of my/this phone. It has now refuse to start/boot up. Now, it's just trash. All of my life's work and story was thrown away on a phone that I could not rely on. One of the worst regrets in my entire life, is not having backed up or prepared myself for the day that this phone would die on me.

This phone is dead compared to modern society's new choices of smartphones. And if it's not physically dead, it will mentally make you die with it. I recommend that you find a better phone for you.
There's not much to elaborate on the pros of this phone since it's outdated and basically have none. But for what it was at the time back in 2012, it didn't need to be high-tech. It provided what a phone was meant to do in its simplicity. Other than that, the rest of the positives of the Pantech Burst has been listed at the beginning of my review. Done.",Cheap phone back then.

- Check with your carrier / provider before purchasing this item.
- Unlocked world GSM phone. 3G -, 2G
Work for AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk, Simple Mobile a
WILL NOT WORK WITH 4G networks
- Unlocked cell phones will not work with CDMA Carriers for Sprint, Verizon, Boost or Virgin.
So that means it does not work with 4G networks.
Other then that if you read that then the phone is pretty decent. It really has a nice design that's similar to my iPhone. Phone does have a regular Sim meaning that you will need a piece to make your SIM card bigger so it won't be as hard to put it in the phone it self.
I did notice that the phone does have words that are misspelled like ""disabled"" as shown in the picture.
Other then that it's fairly nice especially for the price.

The phone is about the same size as my iPhone 7+ in outterbox.

Really easy to change position of the door if needed, and gives notifications with time stamps if it opens or closes. Instructions were clear and easy to understand. Just make sure you take your time when doing the programming part. It is kinda slow to connect and respond. I was sure that it failed and right as pushed the button to start over, the light turned green. I had to start over and be a little more patient.

Finally, I had some free time and I wanted to get our new opener working. I called customer service and they were very helpful. He walked me through the set up - I did everything the same as when I tried to install it, but this time it worked. I tested it and the garage door opened from my ap.
