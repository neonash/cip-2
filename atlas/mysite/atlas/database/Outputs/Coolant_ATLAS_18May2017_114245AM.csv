Valvoline ZEREX G-05 antifreeze coolant is a long life, fully formulated, ethylene glycol-based fluid suitable for passenger cars, light trucks and heavy duty vehicles. The formulation is designed for both gasoline and diesel engines. Its lower-silicate, reduced pH, phosphate free European technology protects all cooling system metals, including aluminum, from corrosion. ZEREX G-05 is a nitrite containing coolant designed to protect diesel engine cylinder liners from cavitation. It contains deposit control additives for protection from hard water deposits and scale. The ASTM and other test data shown on this sheet reflect the high performance corrosion inhibitor package. When diluted 50% with water, ZEREX G-05 protects modern engine components from winter freezing and summer boil over. A 50% to 70% concentration range is suggested for optimum corrosion protection. ZEREX G-05 is compatible with other premium brands of coolant commonly available. It contains a high quality defoamer system and will not harm hoses, plastics or original vehicle finishes. It is also suitable for use in Cummins Deere, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes, MTU, CAT, Navistar, Isuzu and Yanmar diesel engines. ZEREX G-05 is approved by Ford North America for newer models.

Valvoline ZEREX G-05 antifreeze coolant is a long life, fully formulated, ethylene glycol-based fluid suitable for passenger cars, light trucks and heavy duty vehicles. The formulation is designed for both gasoline and diesel engines. Its lower-silicate, reduced pH, phosphate free European technology protects all cooling system metals, including aluminum, from corrosion. ZEREX G-05 is a nitrite containing coolant designed to protect diesel engine cylinder liners from cavitation. It contains deposit control additives for protection from hard water deposits and scale. The ASTM and other test data shown on this sheet reflect the high performance corrosion inhibitor package. When diluted 50% with water, ZEREX G-05 protects modern engine components from winter freezing and summer boil over. A 50% to 70% concentration range is suggested for optimum corrosion protection. ZEREX G-05 is compatible with other premium brands of coolant commonly available. It contains a high quality defoamer system and will not harm hoses, plastics or original vehicle finishes. It is also suitable for use in Cummins Deere, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes, MTU, CAT, Navistar, Isuzu and Yanmar diesel engines. ZEREX G-05 is approved by Ford North America for newer models.

Some packaging feedback for Amazon: a bottle of of this arrived 20 minutes ago and the bottle was leaking all over the protective bag inside the box. Upon inspection of the the half-full bottle, I found the leak in th side of the bottle. You usually provide more than adequate packing material, but this time there was none and half of of my product is on the inside of of the protective bag (at least THAT served it's purpose).

This will be the last time I buy automotive fluids on Amazon.","Driscoll's great, but what a mess!",https://www.amazon.com/Prestone-AF888-Dex-Cool-Antifreeze-Gallon/product-reviews/B004AHGEJU/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Andy C, , ,AM,
