Never needed one before because water usually tastes just fine to me out of the tap (most of the time). Unfortunately I moved into a place that does not have filtered water and it tastes absolutely horrific so I considered all my options and thought a water purifier would be the way to go. I didn't want to spend a lot and I couldn't have it take too much space in the fridge either. I also needed more that just a typical pitcher size. I ordered this lovely 18cup Pur as well as 3 filters to replace when needed. Followed the directions on the filter and in no time had some cool, delicious water to drink. It says you should change the filter every 40 gallons or about every 2 months but you might want to rethink that and gauge how much your family uses. Why? Well, because I found all these tiny black particles left over on the top part of the dispenser (that got filtered out of my drinking water on the bottom). It made me wonder what else is in my water. I also noticed that things started tasting a bit funny or weird like my coffee. We use the filtered water for everything to do with cooking/drinking because our tap is absolutely terrible. So, it only took me about 4 days to figure we use on average 3.75 quarts/day (family of 2) so technically for us it means we'd use 40 gallons in about 43 days. Everyone is different, maybe you don't drink as much or use it for cooking/coffee machine or alternate between bottled waters and it may last you longer but I feel the filters are inexpensive enough to be changed when needed. Love this! Easy to clean, slim design, no issues.","Awesome dispenser, nice slim size.",https://www.amazon.com/PUR-Water-Filtration-Dispenser-Filter/product-reviews/B00IK5A4U8/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,BH,water filter_#N/A_B00IK5A4U8_BH_305_1626, , ,AM,

I compared the specs of several brands and decided to give this little one a try - less expensive system, including replacement filters and good ratings from a trustworthy consumers' test organization. I decided to purchase the chrome model to attach to the sink, but will buy white replacement filters.

One online reviewer reported that the filter was ""very difficult to remove and replace,"" so, before I attached it to the faucet, I decided to remove the filter - just to see how. wow.... I am so glad I did! It took me a couple minutes to figure out exactly where it was supposed to come apart. An online video helped with that. It *was* a real challenge for me, even with tools to help, but I managed okay.

Now that I know how it comes apart, I might just remove it from the faucet while changing the filters. (Been using it a couple months, so that process may happen soon.)

Two things I like a lot about this little gadget - the filtered water is just what I hoped for to make a good cup of tea.... and.... I LOVE the pull-knob that engages the bypass to the filter. So easy, and it automatically pops back in when the water is turned off!

Note: After I've used it for a while, I may revisit my rating; it's too new for 5 stars.","So far, so good....",https://www.amazon.com/Culligan-FM-25-Faucet-Advanced-Filtration/product-reviews/B0064MKTE0/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,T.

The filters clean up all the bad stuff in the water with a quick drip (that matters when you just got back from a run and can't bring yourself to pollute your body with sink water), the whole pitcher looks good enough to put on your table (no more being embarrassed by a pitcher that rhymes with critta), the ingenious refill hole/system saves you time and fumbling, and the whole company runs with a heart that cares about people and our environment (coconut carbon in a plant based filter).

I admit to have leaving it packed up for a week after getting back. I took it apart following the instructions, cleaned it well, and left it to dry on the kitchen sink. A few days later the filters still seemed damp so I let sit until the following weekend. Started putting it back together and when I pushed the pump handle down some water came out of the output port. ??? Ok, so it's still not dry. Took it apart and let it sit for another two weeks. It's in a well ventilated area and today I put it back together and the same thing ... compressed the pump handle and some water came out again (only a few drops, but still, what the heck?). I don't want to put it away damp ... that's just asking for bacteria / mold trouble. How long does it take these filters to dry out?

Oh ... should mention how it worked in the field, eh? :-) When it was time to resupply the water containers we had a nice running stream to collect from. First obstacle I ran into was trying to keep the prefilter under water. Moved the float back to about 12 inches from the end, and ended up just putting a small rock on the intake tube to hold the prefilter under water. Pumping was not easy, although not overly difficult either. Could be challenging for maybe a youth to handle. I think this will get better (easier) after a couple of uses (from what I've read by other reviews). Ended up refilling my 70 oz camelbak and a couple of 32 water bottles. The water tasted great!

Took it out of the box, took it apart, put it back together again and flushed several liters of product through it.
No issues... @ 71 cycles to produce a liter of water.
Packed along on a 3 day trip in the Eastern Sierra and even though I really didn't need to filter the water (I've been drinking the stuff straight from the source for 45 years) due to the massive snow melt, I did cycle a few liters of water through it... No after taste that could detect.
Only concern is that upon reaching home, I cycled some RO drinking water through it ""just in case"" to clear it and let it ""dry"" for most of a full day.
Still, the carbon filter produced some water upon shaking it out and I even pumped some compressed air (10 psi) through it and it still sputtered out some moisture after 3 days.... Put it back in it's handy carrying case and waited a few days to check on it... Pulled it out and shook out the element and it still had some moisture in in... After 2 weeks I took another look at it was finally dry. Not sure I want that water sitting in that filter for ""weeks"" on end... Makes me worry just a bit about ""bugs"" growing in that carbon filter area while being stored. Perhaps the OEM can advise on this?
Would probably purchase again given the quality and price point.

After the Flint water crisis, your city puts out a statement saying there's no danger of lead in the water and that the city does regular tests.

Now imagine you later find out their version of testing is only going to something like 15 random houses and testing the tap water every year or two. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, does it? Especially when your house may have been gutted and redone within the past 10 years, so lead paint isn't an issue, but water pipes are pretty much there to stay.

Finally, imagine your city later puts out of map of the city water lines and where they suspect there may be lead pipes. You take a look and not only are you surrounded on all sides by suspected lead pipes, the entire neighborhood and all the neighborhoods around it all have lead pipes. Granted, lead pipes don't mean lead in the water, but after seeing your house surrounded by red lines, in your mind it might as well be circled by little pictures of skulls and crossbones.

This is where I found myself and why I so quickly snatched this filter from Amazon. The water coming into my house may not be the same as licking a brick made of every toxic substance you can imagine, but my screaming subconscious doesn't much care about better tasting water (honestly, the difference in amazing. Installed this yesterday and I will never have coffee again that doesn't start from filtered water), it cares about not being slowly poisoned to death.

Long story long, my water tastes amazing now. So does my coffee.

This was the exact opposite and you get so much more with your money. This is also a way better solution to waiting for the pitcher one to filter water while your guest gets thirsty.

We used to buy water bottles to serve for convenience or have to go since the pitcher one was such a pain. But after purchasing this, I am really pleased with it.
