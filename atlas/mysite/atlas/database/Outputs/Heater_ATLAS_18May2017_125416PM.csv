It has built in baseboard heating that I used over the 2015-2016 winter. With the baseboard system I heated my bathroom and bedroom only to keep costs down. My monthly electric bill was $120. This past 2016-2017 winter I just set this heater up in a corner and let it run, turning it off when I left. It took 2 or so hours for it to really heat up my entire apartment, but it kept me comfortable and was barely noticeable. Not too noisy. I didn't need to wear my jacket around the apartment anymore, which was nice. The best part, my monthly electric went down to $80 during the cold months I needed it.

The only con is that the tower scrapes along the base when it is oscillating, which can be annoying to listen to. Because I set it in a corner in the kitchen I didn't need to have it oscillating, so it was fine.",Heats a small apartment well,https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-5307-Oscillating-Ceramic-16-Inch/product-reviews/B005M03ER4/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1,Sam Marsh, , ,AM,
